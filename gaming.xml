            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Specialist retro gaming studio Nightdive has announced that the original PC version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>will be delisted later this week, but it's not all bad news.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/238210/view/503964319779651936" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam, Nightdive says the original 1999 release will be delisted from PC storefronts on October 10th, and that's not just Steam, either; it's also GOG and anywhere else the original version of the game is available.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to play the 1999 version rather than Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>, all is not lost. If you pick up the remaster, you'll magically see the original appear in your library as well, and if you already own the remaster, you'll get a copy of the original version free of charge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-pc-delisting-citadel_5.jpg?itok=iJmmxeCl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-pc-delisting-citadel_5.jpg?itok=57KYOyky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from storefronts this week.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, if you did buy the game before its delisting, you'll be able to continue downloading and playing it whenever you like, so if you do want to grab the original without picking up the remaster, you've still got a couple of days to do so.</p>

<p>If you've somehow made it this far without ever hearing about&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, it's a hugely influential first-person shooter released in 1999 by Ken Levine's Irrational Games alongside legendary immersive sim studio Looking Glass.</p>

<p>The game takes place on the Von Braun, where an unknown infection is ripping its way through the ship. Naturally, it's up to you to figure out where this infection is coming from and why it's happening.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;is an immersive sim-style RPG shooter in which you can specialize in various different disciplines to help you explore the Von Braun and battle its many hostile inhabitants. You can hack your way through problems, specialize in combat, or take any number of other approaches.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2_1999/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the remaster is also available across several platforms.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday Nintendo released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/794244/what-is-nintendo-up-to">a mysterious video called “Close to You”</a> that set internet sleuths into action. The video depicted a cute baby seemingly moving objects around a nursery. Some thought that it might be a subtle teaser for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, possibly showing the origin of Rosalina and her powers. Others noticed Pikmin musical cues and the tiny little creatures hiding in the background. Now we know for sure: it was Pikmin.</p><p>Unfortunately, the newly-uploaded video is currently only available in the Nintendo Today app. (I’ll update this post if and when it appears on YouTube.) In the video — which still has the same title — things play out the same, but this time around it shows that those adorable sentient plants are responsible for all of the moving objects. They’re <em>everywhere</em>; flying off rattles, carrying toy blocks, and fighting over a pacifier.</p><p>It’s a cute alternate view of the original video, even if it does raise some big existential questions for the Pikmin universe. Namely: can only children see the creatures? Nintendo has <a href="https://pikminbloom.com/#whats-pikmin-bloom">previously said</a> that Pikmin “cannot be seen with the naked eye,” but maybe the lore has changed. My house could be infested and I wouldn’t even know it.</p><p>Here’s the original video for reference:</p><p>The bigger question, of course, is whether Nintendo is teasing something with this video. A Pikmin movie? An Switch 2 update for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch">Pikmin 4</a></em>? A major expansion for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22746461/pikmin-bloom-hands-on-niantic-iphone-android">Pikmin Bloom</a></em>? A new line of Pikmin-themed pacifiers? Or it could just be a cute, standalone short. Maybe more will be revealed tomorrow.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/796094/nintendo-close-to-you-video-pikmin]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developers Sandfall Interactive have wheeled out news that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'ll be getting a free update which'll include a new location for its party to explore, more boss battles, and some extra costumes. The studio are teasing that there'll be other stuff packed into this update, which they say is designed to act as a thank you to folks who've delved into the Belle Époque Frenchness.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," Clair Obscur director Guillaume Broche told our mates/mortal enemies over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Euro Truck Gamer 2</a>. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now." He added that this update is "not a super big DLC extension with hours of content", but will contain "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well", so set your expectations right in the middle.</p>
<p>The studio have <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive">confirmed some of the stuff that'll be in there</a>. "A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover," is the headliner, but some extra boss battles to challenge late game grinders are giving it a run for its money.</p>
<p>The expeditioneers - no idea if they're ever called that in the game, but I'm rolling with it - will get some new clothes to rock. Text and interface localisation in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian is also incoming. Sandfall have teased that there'll be more things, but they're not revwheeling those things yet. Sorry.</p>
<p>Nic had some words about Clair Obscur when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">reviewed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Very occasionally, I'll play an RPG that makes me feel ten again. Rebirth. Cris Tales. Revisiting Suikoden. Years come, the big number ticks down, and comfortable appreciation replaces the spellbound enchantment of being told a story, of being swept off to a new world. Of playing Final Fantasy 8 in that special edition shirt that Ben Starr likes to wear that I wish I'd kept because I bet it's worth a bloody fortune now. You wait for a game to bring you back there, mostly certain you've moved passed the capacity to feel that way because you now have the sort of adult concerns that cause you ask how much a shirt might be worth on Ebay. I can't say if Clair Obscur will work its magic on everyone the same way, but it certainly did for me. I'm still not ready to leave, honestly. What a special and rare thing this is: a story that feels like someone wanted to tell it so badly it hurt.</blockquote>
<p>Come on dude, stop sitting on the fence and give us some indication of how you feel.</p>
<p>This free Clair Obscur update's got no release date or estimate attached yet, so it'll definitely arrive after Nic achieves the power to reach through my screen, grab me by the collar, and tell me he thought the game was the term above good.</p>

            <p>Paradox have slapped a release date on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s All Under Heaven DLC, the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s "largest expansion" ever, which extends its dynastic soap opera to medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia. The map expansion is coming on 28th October. It's the first time the series has ventured to these latitudes, which seem a little incompatible with the European crusader premise. It also introduces Japanese language support.

<p>In a disgraceful betrayal of Rock Paper Shotgun's fine editorial traditions, I have yet to complete a single game of Crusader Kings 3. Every time I feel like trying, somebody says something like "oh great, let us know when your spymaster has an affair with himself", and I retreat frowning into the bushes. Still, I do like the sound of an expansion that encompasses the river valleys of China, Mount Fuji, and the Great Wall.
</p>
<p>"Keep a steady hand on the regional hegemon or manage the tumult of dynastic change in China," Paradox's emissary explained to us, before I had him thrown in an iron maiden. "Revere the Yamato emperor and his regent in Japan, or pursue the path of the samurai warlord. Build a monumental temple facility in the jungles of Southeast Asia and compel weaker kingdoms to pay tribute to your greatness."
</p>

<p>There's more in the press release from game director Alexander Oltner. "We've always seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> as the story of the entire medieval world, and you can't fully tell that story without East Asia," he comments, rudely undermining my observation up the page about this being an unlikely staging ground for a kingly crusade. Watch your tone, Alexander. We always have an iron maiden going spare.
</p>
<p>Let's all celebrate these fulsome tidings in the traditional medieval style, with a banquet of freshly laid and hard-boiled bulletpoints, covered with saffron and flavoured with cloves.
</p>

<p>The price tag is just as hefty as the expansion itself - $29.99, £24.99 or €29.99. Alternatively, you can get it in the Crusader Kings III: Chapter IV expansion pass. I'm not sure I'd pay £24.99 for the Great Wall - I hear it was more effective as a psychological deterrent than a literal obstacle. Still, you do you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s something that doesn’t happen often: a LEGO Harry Potter set on sale. These sets are among the most popular in the entire LEGO catalog and discounts are rare. When you find one with stellar reviews like this <strong>Hagrid’s Hut set</strong> (which boasts an impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars), it’s even more unusual.</p>
<p>Right now, during the final hours of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/">this popular set has dropped to $41 on Amazon, down from $74 (44% off) which marks an all-time low price</a>. This<strong> deal is exclusively for Prime members</strong>, and there’s no guarantee it’ll return before the holidays roll around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Hagrid’s Hut is one of the most emotive locations in the Wizarding World, the site of Harry’s initial revelations about his magical parentage and the setting of many indelible scenes across the series. For collectors and fans, recreating these scenes is one way that the magic can be brought home in tangible form. This is a masterful capture of the barely-tamed feel of Hagrid’s mountain hut with incredible attention to every little detail.</p>
<h2>Seven Characters and a Dragon Bring the Scene to Life</h2>
<p>The real magic is the character list. You get the complete roster of <strong>seven characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as mini-figures</strong>, plus LEGO interpretations of Norbert,<strong> the baby dragon, and Fang, the loyal boarhound of Hagrid</strong>. With these, kids can reproduce the iconic scene in The Philosopher’s Stone when Harry and his pals discover Hagrid openly incubating a dragon’s egg in secret.</p>



<p>The hut itself is a happy size for play and has beautifully considered design elements that make the building experience all the more fun. It’s easy to access the inside without becoming frustrated <strong>thanks to the removable roof</strong> and the building opens wide to show the detailed interior. Hagrid’s trademark oversized furniture consists of his foldout chair that are beautifully proportioned to his half-giant frame. There is an umbrella stand on which his noted pink umbrella (which actually contains his broken wand) would sit, and the key dragon egg element waits to crack open. <strong>Fang’s doghouse sits separate</strong>&nbsp;and provides depth to the scene as well as the possibility of play scenarios outdoors.</p>



<p>One particularly nice touch is the random inclusion of <strong>two gold-plated portrait elements</strong>: They are among a group of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits that extend across multiple LEGO Harry Potter sets.</p>
<p>The <strong>collection is made up of 465 pieces</strong> and offers multiple hours of fun building time suitable for children aged 8 and above. Complexity falls just in that golden zone between challenging enough that it is rewarding without being tough enough that little builders get stuck.</p>
<p>At this all-time low price, you’re getting incredible value. Those seven characters, two buildings, and the collectible portrait pieces individually would easily merit the whole $74 price. For parents searching for a Halloween special, birthday, or early holiday gift, the deal is the best chance this year to acquire this specific set without breaking the budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot’s free-to-download League of Legends fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> is out now in early access, and the launch has brought with it various bundles, including one based on much-loved animation Arcane that costs a whopping $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans who want the Arcane skins for Vi, Jinx, and Ekko must buy the $100 Ultra Starter Edition. There is no way to buy the skins for each character individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes the aforementioned Arcane skins, all Arcane skin chromas, an Arcane sticker set, 5,000 KO points (the in-game currency), plus everything in the cheaper Deluxe and Standard bundles. As you'd expect, all the contents amounts to more than $100 in terms of the individual value of what's included here, but that hasn’t stopped some fans from reacting with a mix of disbelief and frustration at the way Riot is handling microtransactions so early in the game’s life.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2XKO is free-to-play, so fans expected somewhat aggressive monetization. But forcing players to buy the $100 bundle to get <em>any</em> of the Arcane skins rather than selling them standalone has drawn criticism. A cursory glance at the 2XKO subreddit, social media, and Discord shows the vociferous debate this bundle has sparked into life. “No separate buy? I only play vi,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1o0jaj3/100_bucks_for_the_3_arcane_skins_is_crazy_really/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complained VaninaG</a>. “Like the value of the bundle is not bad, is like buying a game+season pass, but if there's no separate buy for the skins it's kinda predatory because some might just want to spend 10-20 in one skin.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="tl" dir="ltr"><p>wait wait wait wait wait. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Play2XKO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Play2XKO</a> arcane skins cost $100?!?!?!?!</p><p>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/2XKO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#2XKO</a>, you're drunk <a href="https://t.co/T7aacDtuJI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/T7aacDtuJI</a></p></div>— Chris “bootman” Boutté (@bootmanmstz) <a href="https://twitter.com/bootmanmstz/status/1975596511552799165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">holy moly the skin prices in 2XKO are insane. $140 for 3 arcane skins + stuff 💀 i do genuinely hope this game gets as big as Riot's other games and retains enough active players that the f2p model and the game itself are sustainable. <a href="https://t.co/zfrrres0BZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zfrrres0BZ</a></p>— victoria👹 (@vicwingly) <a href="https://twitter.com/vicwingly/status/1975626557306835417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/arcane-league-of-legends">Arcane</a> is hugely popular and brought an army of newcomers into the League of Legends universe. It makes sense that Riot would want to lean on the Netflix animation, its characters and their designs for 2XKO’s launch. And the developer has raised eyebrows for its monetization for its other games, including League of Legends, in the past, so for some this approach for 2XKO comes as no surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Riot isn’t alone in employing these sorts of tactics when it comes to selling virtual video game items. Whether it’s forcing players to buy bundles instead of standalone items, selling bundles of virtual currency that always leave you with a little bit left over so you’re encouraged to spend more, or FOMO-inducing battle passes and in-game shops that make items available for a limited period only, gamers have become accustomed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-fans-blast-cardboard-isaac-clarkes-absurd-35-pricetag-in-free-to-play-skate">expensive cosmetics that are often pricier than entire games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question for Riot is whether 2XKO’s launch monetization does the business. Complaints from the vocal hardcore online probably won’t move the internal needle if the masses open their wallets. But some are already comparing 2XKO to Warner Bros.' failed free-to-download fighting game MultiVersus, which similarly drew controversy for the way it sold virtual items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2xko-review">2XKO early access review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “2XKO has found a way to distill what's fun about tag fighters while mitigating a lot of the pain points that typically come with the territory.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Little Nightmares 3 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-3-review.1319737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of us have recurring nightmares from time to time, whether it’s the one where you go to school naked, or the one where all your teeth fall out, or indeed the one where you go to school naked and all your teeth fall out. However, Little Nightmares 3 isn’t the kind of recurring nightmare that’s likely to keep you awake at night. Instead, this puzzle-platforming sequel feels like a surprisingly uninspired retread of the two shadow-soaked stories that preceded it, and its only noteworthy new addition, a co-op mode, doesn’t shake up the formula to any substantial degree. I went into Little Nightmares 3 steeling myself for a traumatic twilight trip scary enough to make me sit bolt upright in bed, but instead it left me feeling calm enough to roll over and hit the snooze button.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3’s journey through a sequence of dimly lit domains focuses on two entirely new and aptly named child leads, Low and Alone. You select which pint-sized protagonist you want to inhabit at the story’s outset, with the second hero controlled either by the AI – like Six was in Little Nightmares 2 – or by a second player in online co-op. The two leads share the same core abilities like jumping, crouch-walking, and grabbing objects, but they’re each equipped with a unique tool for puzzle-solving and the occasional brief burst of combat. Low has a bow that can be used to shoot ropes to drop crates or switches to move platforms, while Alone lugs around a giant wrench that she can use to smash through weakened walls or manipulate the controls of certain basic bits of machinery found in Little Nightmare 3’s twisted terrain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However there’s little room for experimentation with either character’s unique action, since they are largely context sensitive – Low will typically only raise his bow to fire if there’s a target nearby that he needs to hit, for example – and puzzle solutions always seem pretty obvious as a result. Few of them require much in the way of coordinated combinations of the two characters’ abilities, and I never found myself getting hung up on a brainteaser in Little Nightmares 3 for anywhere near as long as I did when faced with some of the more challenging puzzles of its predecessor, which made it feel like I was just mindlessly going through the motions for most of the five-hour journey.      </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Little Nightmares 3 Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightmare Run</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the tales of the first two Little Nightmares’ which each featured five chapters, Low and Alone’s story is split across only four: the sandswept sprawl of Necropolis; the creepy, lollipop-lined floors of the Candy Factory; the twisted, Tim Burton-esque big tops of Carnavale; and the somewhat generic hospital hallway horrors of The Institute. (There are apparently a further two chapters to come, but they will arrive at a later date as part of a paid expansion pass.) Low and Alone travel to each standalone setting using mirrors as portals, and while I won’t spoil why it is they’re trapped in these nightmare realms or exactly where they’re trying to get to, I will say that I found the unspoken bond that gradually develops between them to be surprisingly sweet, even if the story itself is ultimately pretty slight and not nearly as spooky as the previous two.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the four chapters on offer, Carnavale struck me as the most engaging to explore. There are all sorts of disgusting sights to sneak past in its dank depths lit by string lights and occasional flashes of lightning, from grotesquely overstuffed patrons smacking human pinatas with sticks and gorging themselves face down in straining slop buckets, to a particularly disturbing spin on the classic magician’s trick of sawing a man in half. It also features the most tense combat encounters in the entire adventure, as the diminutive duo is forced to team up against waves of wooden dolls styled like sideshow alley barkers, with Low knocking their heads off with a well-timed arrow and then frantically trying to avoid the clutches of their headless bodies, while Alone rushes in to club their discarded skulls with her wrench to terminate them for good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Little Nightmares 3 is less of a frightening new beast and more of a familiar Frankenstein's monster assembled with parts repurposed from the previous two games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this handful of memorable moments, though, Little Nightmares 3 is less of a frightening new beast and more of a familiar Frankenstein's monster assembled with parts repurposed from the previous two games. The towering baby doll that looms large in the background of the Necropolis chapter like some sort of slack-eyed Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is certainly an intimidating sight to behold, but overcoming it is painfully straightforward – you simply need to time your movements to slink past it when its vision cone shifts like so many other stalkers in the series’ past. Remember timing your jumps in tandem on top of a trap door to crash your way down through to basement levels in Little Nightmares 2? Well, get ready to repeat that action several times over in Little Nightmares 3, along with regular stops to slowly rip the wooden beams off boarded-up doorways and push and pull crates in order to clamber up onto shelves. It all starts to feel a bit too repetitive long before you roll credits, which isn’t ideal for a story with a runtime so short it can be completed in a single late night session.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Umbrella Cooperation</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple of additional tools that Low and Alone gain access to along the way that switch things up slightly. For the first two chapters, the plucky young pair is equipped with umbrellas that can be unfurled to either take advantage of updrafts and float up to out of reach platforms, or to cushion the fall from equally great heights, which adds a welcome wrinkle to the story’s otherwise strictly linear exploration. However, any interesting movement methods these parasols present are completely quashed at the story’s midpoint, when the umbrella is ditched in favour of a flashlight that has considerably less impact on the action. Sure, it illuminates your increasingly gloomy surroundings, but there’s never a time where it’s used as a tool for heightening the tension in any interesting ways. I still get chills thinking about that sequence in Little Nightmares 2 that involved desperately shining a flashlight to halt the march of prosthetically-limbed patients in its menacing hospital setting, but sadly there’s nothing nearly as terrifying as that here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Little Nightmares 3 quickly settles into a fairly predictable rhythm of alternating between slow and steady stealth sections and urgent chase sequences, both plagued by instant fail outcomes that are at least mitigated somewhat by mostly generous checkpointing. Zero-tolerance terminations are nothing new in the series, of course - however, these swift deaths did highlight the occasionally idiotic behaviour of the partner AI this time around, like when an CPU-controlled Low kept shooting arrows as the same giant fly in the Necropolis that would fall and crush him, sending us back to the nearest checkpoint. For several frustrating repeated deaths, it proved to be a literal game-breaking bug.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AI issues can be avoided by playing through Little Nightmares 3 in co-op, of course, but although this new two-player mode has been touted as one of its most distinguishing features, it’s been implemented in a disappointingly limited fashion. For starters, co-op is online-only so you can’t play through the story with a friend on the couch beside you, which is a shame if, like me, you enjoy partnering up in games with your spouse or children. It also isn’t drop-in, drop-out, so if you start a game in co-op but your fellow adventurer decides they’re too creeped out to continue, you have to start the story over again in order to play solo, which seems like an entirely unnecessary restriction to impose.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Awesome Couch Co-Op Games</h3><p>Sofa, so good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3 does however offer a generous friend pass system similar to that of Split Fiction, allowing a second player to join you without them having to purchase their own copy of the game, but that’s pretty much where the comparisons with Hazelight Studios’ co-op epic end. Little Nightmares 3 can’t compete with Split Fiction’s consistently innovative brilliance in co-operative game design, nor the replay value it offers by featuring such widely contrasting experiences between its two playable characters. After finishing the campaign as Low, I immediately started again as Alone and was disappointed to find there was no meaningful difference between the two beyond one character’s ability to hit things and the other's ability to shoot them.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite a pair of new protagonists and the inclusion of two-player support for the first time in the series, Little Nightmares 3 doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from the previous two adventures, making each step through its shadowy structures less full of dread and more like a retread. There are some memorably morbid moments here and there, and the Carnavale chapter is a standout, but the constant crate-pushing and instant-fail chase sequences feel all too familiar at this point. Little Nightmares 3 features little innovation, few scares, and limited appeal if you’ve already played the previous two games, unless you’re dead keen to experience the series’ signature brand of stop-start stealth with a friend in tow. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all of their outdated issues, I have a soft spot for 3D platformers that makes itself known whenever something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review"><u>Super Mario Odyssey</u></a> finds a clever way to breathe new life back into the genre. Yooka-Replaylee, which remixes a platformer that was already soggy with nostalgia, doesn’t get anywhere near that bar, but it does at least succeed in making the cute-but-forgettable adventure of 2017’s Yooka-Laylee into something more competent. My biggest gripes with the original, including camera issues, sloppy controls, and a lack of fast travel, have all been addressed, with lots of fat and ideas that didn’t work being thrown out as well. But there’s also an odd Frankenstein quality to this reworked creation, a surprising number of technical shortcomings, and the same unrelenting focus on nostalgia for the 3D platformers of yesteryear that results in almost nothing unique or novel. There are still good times to be had with this charming lizard/bird duo, but the reconfigured experiment that serves as their latest adventure only succeeds at turning a game that never quite worked into something a little less underwhelming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than the simple remaster its cheeky title might imply, Yooka-Replaylee is a complete overhaul that fixes a pretty large number of missteps, but it’s still a 3D platforming collectathon at its heart. It wears its on-the-nose Banjo-Kazooie inspirations on its sleeve, so you’ll be hopping, gliding, and rolling around colorful worlds while chatting with dorky, googly-eyed characters as you hunt for the all-important “Pagies” required to unlock the next area. Fortunately, now you can do all that sans the absolutely atrocious camera and imprecise controls of the original, which is quite nice, and everything from the quests you’ll tackle to the story to even things as fundamental as the number of Pagies you’re collecting has been completely redesigned, to its benefit more often than not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yooka-Replaylee Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re solving basic jumping puzzles, fighting goofy looking monsters, or playing minigames like a gem-grabbing minecart ride, Yooka-Replaylee never gets any more challenging than requiring the rare second attempt. Combat in particular is as straightforward as can be, as it usually amounts to just spamming the tailspin attack until everything dies, and enemies are absolutely rubbish at being able to land hits on you. The improved controls and camera also mean the extreme simplicity of its platforming has become more glaring, and most puzzles can be solved just by knowing the basic bag of movement tricks in your belt. That could be springboarding off of Yooka’s tail for increased jumping height or learning that you can eat certain objects to augment your powers, like red orbs that give Yooka the ability to spit fire and melt things. It’s extremely basic stuff, and while it all plays much better without as much wonkiness, it’s just not that exciting to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a lot of work has clearly been put into making this version feel much better, as Yooka-Laylee’s awkward camera angles and slippery movement used to be near-constant annoyances. Probably the best compliment I can give is that I almost never thought about the camera while playing, because it was never really an issue. Of course, I’d occasionally get stuck in some weird corner or whatever and momentarily have to swing the camera around, but with controls that feel quite smooth, it never caused me much trouble as I hopped around hungrily gobbling up Pagies. I never raged during the rare instances where I failed a platforming attempt, either, since I only had myself to blame for any muck ups this time around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fresh paint doesn’t solve the underlying problem that this all feels generic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But tighter controls do nothing to address Yooka-Replaylee’s biggest issue: the original was already an unambitious throwback that played on your love of old school 3D platformers instead of trying to push that mold or do something interesting within it. Yooka-Replaylee is quite literally a remake of a game that was itself already a remix of old ideas, and a fresh coat of paint doesn’t solve the underlying problem of this all feeling generic and unsurprising. The fact that it’s coming out an additional eight years later certainly doesn’t help with that either, as we’ve had even more time to outgrow these dated designs as standouts like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> explored the genre in more exciting ways. Even when I was impressed by just how much they improved here, I still struggled to find a reason to recommend this to anyone when they could just play Astro Bot instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say it’s exactly the same, and one of the more fundamental changes is the overall pace of the adventure. Instead of unlocking abilities as you go by collecting a special currency in each area, you get all of those abilities right away and then learn to take advantage of them as they come up during platforming puzzles. Similarly, rather than unlocking different sections of each of the five main levels in phases, you have access to their full maps right from the get-go and can even fast travel to different points to minimize monotonous backtracking, which is awesome. And instead of 25 somewhat sparse Pagies to find in each level, this number has been doubled to 50, so you get to watch Yooka and Laylee delightfully freak out about finding one twice as often. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these tweaks combine to make everything about Yooka-Replaylee feel faster and less linear. Instead of seeing a Pagie out of reach and knowing you’ll have to return to get it once you’ve unlocked a certain ability you don’t yet have, you can more or less sprint through each zone grabbing everything in sight until you’ve utterly cleared it. Even cooler: you’re given a map with a checklist of all the Pagies in each world, so you can scratch your completionist itch without wandering around for hours in search of something that’s alluding you – unless that thing is a Pagie <em>piece</em>, which they don’t show you on the map for some frustratingly inconsistent reason, so you could spend three hours searching for the last one on a level like I <em>definitely didn’t do</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Removing these artificial barriers to progress is without question a good decision, and it was quite freeing to be let loose in each world to methodically solve every puzzle and combat encounter in my path, but there are some pretty weird side effects of making so many overhauls as well. The most wonky example stems from the increased number of Pagies, which completely alters the flow of the adventure in some pretty unappealing ways. If the original Yooka-Laylee was explicitly designed around the 3D platforming philosophy of classic games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, where collectibles were harder to get but more meaningful, then Yooka-Replaylee has been adapted to be more like Super Mario Odyssey, where you’re picking up items left and right. The problem is that some remain hidden behind legacy designs that ask you to win a minigame or beat a boss, while you’ll find others just lying around in easily reachable places or crammed into spots that don’t feel like a terribly natural fit. On the bright side, you get the dopamine hit of finding collectibles twice as often, but it feels pretty odd when some take significantly more effort than others, which serves as a fairly obvious reminder of just how much this thing has been altered.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unexpected side effects of its Frankenstein construction are all over the place.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme instance of this tweak going awry is the fact that, after doing a completionist run of the first two worlds, I realized I had gathered enough Pagies to just… go finish the story? That’s right – I still only needed 120 of these guys to head to the big baddie’s lair and trigger the final boss fight, and since that’s a lot easier now than it once was, I walked right into his home and rolled credits before even entering the other three stages. I’m not sure if this was an intentional decision to give players more freedom to approach the adventure how they want, but it just felt downright weird to do, especially since some of the cutscenes along the way still reference events that are supposed to take place in the worlds I skipped. For this reason, I was actually able to roll credits after just four hours, then went back and spent another seven on the other levels in the most anti-climactic way possible, completely removing any urgency to be a completionist with the remaining worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The unexpected side effects of this heavily revised collectathon’s Frankenstein construction are all over the place. For example, in the original you had lots of reasons to talk to fun side characters like Trowzer the snake, who had a chance to show off his amusing personality as he sold you all of your platforming abilities. But since you get access to those abilities right at the start now, Trowzer has been relegated to an entirely optional vendor you only have a reason to chat with maybe once per stage, leaving him devoid of most of the silly bits and one-liners he previously delivered. Another example of this is one of the villains, Dr. Quack, who used to goof around with you as he forced you to take his annoying quizzes throughout the story. These have been removed completely, which I’m certainly not crying about as these sections were never much fun, but it also means you don’t really get to build a relationship with this guy and lose a lot of the heart that was previously one of Yooka-Laylee’s strengths.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite 3D Platformers</h3><p>Do you like jumping? Then I recommend hopping on these games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: I still think the vast majority of these changes are a step in the right direction, even when they introduce some jankiness or come at the cost of some jokes getting dropped. It’s just abundantly clear how much this thing has been tortured to correct for errors of the past, to the point where it almost feels like it would have been a better idea to just make a new game altogether. The story in particular feels like a casualty to all the revisions, since you speak to characters far less and spend a whole lot less time understanding the bad guys and their motivations, so it almost feels like you’re required to have played Yooka-Laylee (and remember enough of it) to understand this remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you do or not, it’s at least easy to appreciate just how good Yooka-Replaylee looks. The visual improvement over the original is absolutely massive. Everything is more colorful, lighting has been fixed so you never feel like you’re wandering through the dark, and Yooka and friends are more expressive. Plus, you can enjoy how pretty it all looks with a whole bunch of neat cosmetics to swag up your heroes as you explore. Unfortunately, this glow-up is offset by the fact that I encountered numerous technical shortcomings, from abrupt crashes to framerates absolutely tanking during boss fights or other unfortunate moments. Crashes were fairly rare, and unlike with Yooka-Laylee, I never fell through the map or got caught on the environment, but the framerate dips were worse than anything I encountered in the original, and happened often enough to leave me pretty irritated.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Yooka-Replaylee aims to overhaul a platformer that was rife with frustrating issues, and while it does feel better for it, none of its changes do enough to bring it close to the 3D platforming standards of today. Improvements to the movement of both your camera and character, the upgraded graphics, and the removal of unnecessary annoyances like having to unlock abilities over time are all fantastic changes. But all of the bending that was done to modernize this thing has resulted in an almost equal number of drawbacks, like a story that has been unsatisfyingly chopped up and a search for Pagies that feels a bit too easy given how many are now crammed into each area. So unless your nostalgia for this kind of 3D platformer is particularly strong, there aren’t a ton of compelling reasons to revisit this one.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yooka-replaylee-review]]></content:encoded>

Amara was the playable Siren character first introduced in 2019's Borderlands 3, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674?" rel="nofollow ">but EpicNNG believes that the files they uncovered</a> pointed toward players originally teaming up with a different Siren at this point in the story: Ava.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Alright I guess we're gonna talk about it:<br>AVA WAS CUT FROM BORDERLANDS 4<br>There are numerous files related to her in the game, more specifically outlining that she was completely replaced by Amara late in development.

The files discovered by EpicNNG have several "Ava" titles, and Amara uses powers that are very similar to Ava's own Siren abilities that she inherited from her deceased mentor, Maya.</p><p>"It would appear everything aside from references has been completely scrubbed, including audio files, models, and more," <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975223565248299443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EpicNNG added</a>, noting that this might have been an "intentional blunder" from a Gearbox employee, given just how difficult it is to pick through Borderlands 4 data for clues on post-release content. "This game is airtight on datamining," <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975240774909407319" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they explained</a>. "Nothing pre-or post release is in the files as of now. More credibility to this being intentional[ly] left in by a dev."</p><p>Ava's role in Borderlands 3 drew a lot of criticism, with many players pointing out her grating personality, her role in getting fan-favorite character Maya killed by the Calypso Twins, and her immature outbursts. Essentially, she was the Scrappy-Doo of Borderlands, but a deleted scene from the game did suggest that a redemption arc for her was on the cards, as she realized how her actions had led to Maya's death.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui50I7jvH2M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ui50I7jvH2M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last year, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481" rel="nofollow ">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford asked his audience</a> how they'd feel about Ava returning, with the general consensus being heavily against seeing the young Siren in Borderlands 4.</p><p>Whether Ava returns or not remains to be seen, but we do know that another familiar face, Moxxi's daughter Ellie, will be a major character in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-borderlands-4-will-keep-you-looting-and-shooting-after-launch/1100-6534397/">first Borderlands 4 post-launch expansion</a> alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gets-new-vault-hunter-in-early-2026/1100-6535088/">new Vault Hunter C4sh</a>.</p>

            <p>It turns out there is a lovely little Silent Hill 1 Easter egg hidden within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> that the musically inclined have discovered.</p>
<p>Found within the school in Silent Hill f, posted on a cork board, is some sheet music. It turns out this sheet music is the old SIlent Hill 1 theme. It's a nice callback in a game that largely stays away from obvious ties to the original series, save for some smaller references here and there.</p>
<p>You can see the Easter egg figured out by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@frankielollia/video/7558678739467406614?_r=1&amp;_t=ZN-90NUwIqnd6E">streamer Frankielollia</a>, who spotted the sheet music and had one of their viewers play it on guitar, before comparing it directly with the original theme. That classic Silent Hill theme remains one of the most iconic horror game themes of all time, and is well-deserving of a callback.</p>

		<p>One of the most welcome surprises of the last six months was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This turn-based RPG, managed to out-JRPG the Japanese, with French team Sandfall Interactive putting together an exquisitely-crafted turn-based adventure with the kind of production values and storytelling normally reserved for Square Enix and Final Fantasy. It’s fair to say that it hit home with plenty of players too, and the team have just announced the incredible milestone of 5 million players, worldwide, who’ve set out on that thirty-third expedition. As a ‘thank you’ to all those players, Sandfall Interactive have announced today that they’ll be releasing a massive new DLC package, bringing new areas, content and brand-new boss battles to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-gEg-jBjPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As one of the best games of the year, it’s such good news that we’re going to be getting even more Clair Obscur, especially when it’s not just the game that’s been a massive hit, with the orechestral soundtrack racking up a huge 333 million listens as well! We loved it here at TSA Towers, and Gamoc scored it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">insane 10/10</a>, saying “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a beautiful experience that excels in almost every area – the combat and character skill customisation is some of the most intricate I’ve seen, the storyline is routinely surprising and emotional, characterisation and performances are immaculate, and it both looks and sounds absolutely stunning all the time. It’s a stunning accomplishment for Sandfall Interactive’s first game, and with a core team of around 30 (with outsourced help). It’s sure to be in contention for Game of the Year awards, and anyone not playing it is seriously missing out.”</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover.</li>
<li>Challenging, new boss battles for late-game players to overcome.</li>
<li>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure.</li>
<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
<li>Plus, even more surprises fans can look forward to!</li>
</ul>
<p>“The response to our game has been nothing short of incredible,” says Guillaume Broche, Creative Director of Expedition 33 at Sandfall Interactive. “We spent years working on our dream project, and to know it has resonated with fans around the world in such a powerful way is both wonderful and overwhelming. We’re so grateful to our fans for their love of the world we created, for sharing their own fan art and music covers, for wearing their best Baguette cosplays to conventions, and for being incredibly supportive of our game. We hope the update we’re working on will act as a ‘thank you’ to those fans for their support – please be patient while our team work hard on bringing you something worth the wait.”</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now for PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC. If you hurry, it’s currently on offer on PS5 too, bringing its price in line with the PC version.</p>

<p>Trinket Studios (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_chef_brigade">Battle Chef Brigade</a>) and Outersloth revealed their brand new and rather tasty-looking card-battler, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_suit_aces">Battle Suit Aces</a>, a little while back, and it's out right this very moment on the Nintendo Switch Entertainment System.</p>
<p>Now, if you're feeling in any way like this particular writer, you may have just thought, <em>'No, no more card-battling games - I reckon I'm all good for now, folks.'</em> But judging from what we've seen of this one, it may well be worth your time, especially if you're into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona</a>-styled storylines threaded throughout battles that feature things like massive robots and gigantic monsters. Y'know, all the best things.</p>
<p>We've already seen in the past how a good story can bring a card game to life in all-new ways, thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inscryption">Inscryption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/slay_the_spire">Slay the Spire</a>, and, with the press release describing a "heartfelt hunt for alien superweapons", Battle Suit Aces has certainly got our attention.</p>
<p>Here are some more story details from the folks over at Trinket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on a heartfelt journey through the stars on the USS Zephyr, joining Captain Heathcliff and his ragtag crew as they search the galaxy for fabled Relic Suits. Sojourn through monster-infested galactic wilds, leading your crew through danger, tragedy, and comedic sci-fi shenanigans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is currently available on the eShop at a launch discount price of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/battle-suit-aces-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOor3WyIV2HocHJ_LHTM8XWAAhu72zeNcxMM0NOkpNARSi5Frg9uO">£19.88/$22.49</a> (or whatever that is where you are).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-confirms-its-%E2%80%9Cclose-to-you%E2%80%9D-short-has-something-to-do-with-pikmin-but-we-still-don%E2%80%99t-know-what-that-is.1319680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-close-to-you-short-pikmin-super-mario-galaxy-movie-tease-speculation/">released an animated short titled "<em>Close to You</em>"</a> with absolutely no explanation as to what it could be referring to. There were definite hints, like a blurry Pikmin seen in the background of a shot and the music coming from Pikmin 4, but we couldn't say for certain that it was anything Pikmin-related, or if it potentially had something to do with the Super Mario Galaxy movie, or if it was something else entirely.</p>



<p>Well, today Nintendo answered one of those questions for us. On its Nintendo Today app, the company released a new version of the "<em>Close to You</em>" video, though this time, instead of the little baby's toys and soother appearing to move around by magic, we can see clearly that there were invisible little Pikmin all around the room.</p>



<p>So it is a Pikmin-related project, that much we can say. What that project is, however, is still another question entirely. It could, of course, be the beginning of a marketing campaign that will lead into the release of Pikmin 5. It could also be our first look at a new project from Nintendo's new Nintendo Pictures arm, which would explain why there's been no sign of Illumination or Universal in either of the videos.</p>



<p>If that's the case, then this could potentially be a new film or a new TV series based on Pikmin. At the time of this writing, just like the original version of the video that was posted to Nintendo's social accounts, the Nintendo Today app, and Nintendo's YouTube channels simultaneously, this new version comes with no added explanation as to what it is. It's also still only available to watch on the Nintendo Today app, and has yet to be shared to the aforementioned verticals so far.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn even more about whatever this project is soon. Perhaps we just need to wait another day for the full reveal to arrive tomorrow morning.</p>

            <p>Amid continued concerns about Steam and Itch's changing of their approach to adult games earlier this year, the UK government have stated they've got "no plans to intervene" in the decisions of payment processors who opt to withdraw support over certain content.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Valve</a> changed their rules regarding adult content in games a few months ago. That prompted a number of delistings and takedowns, as well as concerns about censorship. The storefronts pointed to pressure from credit card companies who process their purchases, with Australian protest group Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">taking credit</a> for nudging those payment processors into action.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response, <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/">counter-campaigners</a> have been making various efforts to push for a reverse in course, by mass calling companies like Visa and Mastercard, as well as petitioning governments to intervene. Enter a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/734441">petition to the UK government</a> urging politicians to "ban payment processors stopping services based on objections to legal content", which has just gotten a response.</p>
<p>"Decisions regarding which businesses payment processors contract with are a commercial matter, taking into account the relevant requirements on the firm," reads the UK treasury statement in question. "These decisions will be influenced by a variety of factors, and the Government has no plans to intervene in those commercial decisions."</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>It's not a hugely surprising outcome, especially given this petition follows <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/722903">another one</a> which currently has over 540,000 signatures and attempts to convince the government to repeal the Online Safety Act, which came into force in the UK earlier this year and requires adult media sites to use age verification. That petition also received a firm no.</p><p>This latest appeal, which has so far amassed 12,355 signees, cited "reports that payment processing companies have recently placed pressure on companies that rely on their services, pressuring them to remove legitimate content" and called for payment processors to be made to "remunerate platforms and individuals for lost income until service is restored".</p>
<p>From my perspective, I'd say the wording opted for might have made the petition easier to dismiss, since it doesn't specify the legal adult games that are allegedly being targeted. To be clear, that's solely based on the view that it'd potentially be easier for politicians to wave away the petition or plead ignorance of its context if the question's more vague, assuming they're also likely predisposed not to want to be seen to mess with business/the processors unless presented with an undeniable reason for doing so. That said, it's impossible to tell from the page whether those who submitted the petition have or were given the chance to offer specific examples that could fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>If you want a much more thorough rundown of both the role payment processors play in defining or influencing definitions of what's permissible in terms of adult content, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">Edwin's full report on the subject</a>. In that report, former Stripe software engineer and acadmic Dr David L. Stearns said that he does believe it's possible the pushback from game developers could result in governments opting to amend or clarify laws or regulations, but this would likely require "significant leverage" in the form of pressure from voters or lobbyists.</p>
<p>Another potential solution is game storefronts seeking out alternative payment processors for adult content, something Itch.io have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">previously indicated they're looking into</a>, but that one isn't a guaranteed win, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an animated short called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-animated-close-to-you-mario-pikmin-theory-2000632576"><span>“Close to You”</span></a><span> on its YouTube and social media channels. The video was posted with no context, no description, and even its comments were turned off, so no one could speculate about its meaning in the comments. Today, Nintendo uploaded an updated version of the short on the Nintendo Today app that sheds some light on the mystery by revealing Pikmin, the titular little plant-like creatures from Nintendo’s strategy game series, were behind the original video’s shenanigans all along.</span></p> <p><span>Some fans clocked this yesterday, as the video had some </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>musical motifs in its score, and it looked like one of these plant guys was carrying items in the background of one shot. But there was also a fair bit of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524"><span>speculation that it could have been a clip from the upcoming </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>, depicting what could have been a baby Rosalina taking her first steps. But now we know for sure, because the updated video shows all the weird floating items in the baby’s room were actually being moved by Pikmin the whole time. The video hasn’t been uploaded outside of the Nintendo Today app at the moment, but the updated version is almost exactly the same, but it’s like someone flipped a switch and enabled a whole other layer in the rendering process, showing dozens of Pikmin crawling around the baby’s room. We’ll update this story when the video is uploaded on YouTube or any platform we can actually embed.</span></p> <p><span>The question remains, however: what is this teasing? Is it a new </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>game? A movie? The return of the </span><a href="https://pikmin.nintendo.com/en/short-movies/"><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>short movies</span></a><span>? Maybe we’ll find out more tomorrow if a third version drops? Or maybe it’s just a fun one-off thing some animators wanted to put together? Whatever the case, it’s a cute short. I hope to be able to watch it on something other than my phone before the day’s end.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000633160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon.1319665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hair dryers have existed for decades without meaningful innovation, essentially just blowing hot air at varying intensities until your hair eventually dries. Dyson revolutionized this category by applying aerospace engineering principles to airflow dynamics, and created a dryer that uses intelligent heat control and concentrated air velocity rather than extreme temperatures to dry hair faster.</p>
<p>The <em>Supersonic</em> and its sibling the <em>Airwrap</em> (hair dryer and styler) never see discounts throughout the year, with price drops limited exclusively to Prime Day and Black Friday events. Right now, on the final day of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">the Supersonic Origin has hit a record low at $299, down from its standard $419 price</a>. This 29% discount represents the <strong>best pricing Prime members will see</strong> on Dyson’s hair dryer until Black Friday arrives months from now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech that Changes the Functionality of Drying the Hair</h2>
<p>The Dyson Supersonic addresses the root issue with ordinary dryers: they use intensive heat to break down the water quickly and damage the cuticles on the hair and causing the brittle and fried quality that results from everyday heat styling. Dyson’s design is focused on the V9 digital motor, a very tiny, very powerful motor found in the handle – not the head. It <strong>rotates at as many as 110,000 rpm and creates high-velocity airflow reaching as high as 13 liters per second</strong>. This focused stream of air works through the exterior layers of the hair down into the interior to dry from the inside out, saving time that the hair is exposed to heat.</p>
<p>The air multiplier technology boosts this flow by <strong>sucking up ambient air into the stream, tripling the initial amount</strong> without the need for increased motor power. This produces a high-pressure and high-velocity stream of air that’s robust enough to instantly dry hair and stable enough to style accurately. It is quite a distinct experience compared to the typical dryers that blow out the hot air everywhere on the surface of your skull.</p>



<p>Intelligent heat control is the biggest technological break-through in the history of healthy-looking hair: A glass bead thermistor is located in the airflow stream and senses the temperature of the air every 40 times per second and reporting back to the microprocessor. Heating element output is varied continuously by the system as needed to hold the desired temperature under very tight tolerances and suppresses the temperature glitches that occur in ordinary dryers when airflow diminishes or ceases.</p>



<p>The magnetic attachments also feature a styling concentrator, producing a narrow, focused blade of air that is ideal for precise styling, such as smoothng out areas when blow-drying or making sleek styles. The diffuser gently disperses airflow all around the curls to dry them without breaking curl patterns or causing frizz. They attach magnetically and spin 360 degrees, angling airflow precisely where you want, without the uncomfortable wrist work needed on dryers with stationary attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Three speed settings and four heat settings</strong> provide flexibility for different hair types and styling needs. The cold shot button delivers unheated air to set styles or cool down after drying. Fast drying mode combines maximum airflow with high heat for thick hair that takes forever to dry, while regular drying balances speed with gentler treatment. Styling mode reduces both airflow and heat for detailed work on specific sections.</p>
<p>For just $299, you’re saving $120 on technology that seriously takes care of the health of your hair and still gives you professional-level drying. Deals like these on Prime Big Deal Day are gone after tonight.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/credit-card-sized-our-favorite-10000mah-45w-power-bank-is-going-for-pennies-2000633165</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/credit-card-sized-our-favorite-10-000mah-45w-power-bank-is-going-for-pennies.1319662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of battery in the middle of your day is one of those modern frustrations that can derail plans or leave you anxiously watching your phone percentage tick down. A portable charger solves that anxiety but most options are bulky bricks that take up valuable bag space. The <em>INIU</em> 10,000mAh power bank breaks that mold as one of the smallest portable chargers on the market and makes it easy to slip into any pocket or bag compartment. During Amazon’s <strong>Prime Big Deal Days</strong>, this model dropped to $21 on day one, but now on the final day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">there’s an additional coupon bringing it down to $19, down from the original $29</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The true innovation is INIU’s TinyCell which is <strong>high-density battery cells that cram 10,000mAh of capability into a package that is just 30% smaller and 15% lighter than rival packages</strong> that deliver the same output. That translates to shouldering serious charging capability without the weight and mass that all too frequently accompanies high-capability power banks.</p>

<h2>Speed That Really Saves Your Day</h2>
<p>The 45W Power Delivery chip on board provides truly fast charging times. INIU can <strong>get an iPhone 17 up to 60% in a mere 25 minutes</strong>, the difference between sitting at home waiting on your phone to charge versus walking out the door with enough power left over to get the rest of your day done. That 45W output also translates to being able to support the <strong>more power-hungry devices like iPads or be able, in a pinch, to charge some laptops</strong>, putting this power bank above the abilities of typical 18W or 20W portable chargers.</p>
<p>The <strong>twin USB-C port design</strong> distinguishes this from virtually all other power banks available. Both the USB-C ports are dual-purpose as you can charge the power bank itself via either one and as a second output charge devices via either one as well. This is convenient when one is dealing with multiple USB-C device and doesn’t need separate cables that have separate uses. With the <strong>addition of the USB-A port</strong>, one ends up with three combined outputs that are able to charge the phone, the earbuds, and the smartwatch all at the same time when one is needed.</p>



<p>That <strong>10,000mAh battery is equivalent to approximately two full charges on most smartphones</strong> or one full charge on the larger phones with some juice left over. For tablets such as iPads, you can expect about 70-80% of a full charge on the model dependent. The size is balanced between being portable and useful, enough to get through prolonged airplane days or multiple days away from outlets without being too much on everyday carry.</p>
<p>INIU arrives with protection like <strong>temperature control, surge protection, and short-circuit protection</strong>, aided by their three-year warranty and lifetime tech support. Included is the USB-C to USB-C cable with lanyard, which makes it easy to clip the power bank on packs or have the power bank easily kept close at hand. At $19 after the coupon, this power bank is less expensive than two movie tickets but solves an issue you face every day.</p>

<p>It may have only launched with two days left in the month, but NBA 2K26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for August 2025. According to the latest data from Circana, which looks at sales information from August 3-30, NBA 2K26 only had two days’ worth of data yet still came out on top.</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7adeyc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Following the latest</a> from 2K Sports was Madden 26 at number two. Rounding out the top five were Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and EA Sports College Football 26.</p>



<p>When looking at newly released games that made the Top 20, there were seven new entries. Aside from the four new games mentioned above, Gears of War: Reloaded, the EA Sports Kickoff Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26, and Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar all joined the list.  Even games like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: The Hinokami Chronicles 2, Helldivers 2, and Hogwarts Legacy re-entered the top 20 after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-26-was-julys-best-selling-video-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling out in July</a>.</p>



<p>Games that fell out of the top 20 include Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, F1 25, MLB The Show 25, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC 25, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Elden Ring, and Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Season 1</a> begins on October 28, which is also the date that the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode</a> is rumored to launch.</p>

                <p>Epic hasn't been shy about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wins-legal-judgment-against-fortnite-cheater/1100-6532743/" data-ref-id="1100-6532743">going after Fortnite cheaters</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-cracks-down-on-fortnite-cheat-seller-and-ddoser/1100-6533155/" data-ref-id="1100-6533155">targeting cheat sellers</a> in court. Now, Epic is suing two UEFN devs, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, and accused the pair of using bots to artificially create engagement on their creations.</p><p>As laid out <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/929543657/Epic-Games-suing-two-Fortnite-Island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in the lawsuit</a>, Nahdi and Nasser allegedly created over 20,000 fake bot accounts and programed them to visit each others' Fortnite islands to inflate the engagement metric Epic uses to compensate creators. Epic paid the pair for the month of December 2024, and then noticed that the bots they created were only engaged with the 10 islands created by the plaintiffs.</p><p>The lawsuit contends that over 80% of the engagement on the plaintiffs' Islands was artificial, and in some cases, "over 99% of the engagement ... was artificial." Epic is attempting to claw back the tens of thousands of dollars" it paid to the pair for December 2024 in addition to asking the court to set additional fees for damages incurred while also legally barring Nahdi and Nasser from ever using Fortnite or any Epic Games server ever again.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome of this case, Epic has laid out ambitious plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-pay-for-visibility/1100-6534859/" data-ref-id="1100-6534859">Fortnite creators to sell in-game items</a> and potentially earn real money for their creations.

Additionally, Epic has introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-ai-powered-darth-vader-fortnite-introduces-an-ai-chatbot/1100-6535086/" data-ref-id="1100-6535086">an AI chatbot for support</a> that's currently in the testing phase for a small percentage of users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Fear is fundamentally different when you’re alone. The creeping shiver up your spine, the thump and thud of far-off noises, and the sense of loneliness and danger are all heightened if there’s no one else with you. That presents a particular problem for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</a>. This is the first game in the series to introduce co-operative play, and that means the fear is shared. Crucially, though, it’s not halved, moulding the terror into a new experience that doesn’t dull the expertly crafted atmosphere that the series is known for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III - 'Alone' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEXxEH8NQe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s two new characters to choose from in Little Nightmares 3: Low, the slight, bird-skull wearing boy who carries a simple bow and arrow, and Alone, the orange-haired mechanic girl, her patched-up overalls tying perfectly with the metallic wrench slung on her back. This tiny pair are tied together, and the eagle-eyed might realise we’re joining them mid-way through their journey into The Spiral, a loose collection of different disturbing delusions. They have a map, they’ve come through a mirror, and they’re together. Little Nightmares 3 doesn’t need to give you any more narrative impetus than that.</p>


<p>Little Nightmares 3 looks incredible. The sense of desolation and decay permeates every element of the different settings, and the atmosphere remains impeccable, driven by the atonal soundtrack, the creaking, cracking, and groaning of mechanisms, and the haunting calls of crows and creatures.</p>
<p>There are two visual settings on PS5, and Beauty really does make each moment look like a living diorama, with dust motes drifting through the air, and gallons of guts shimmering sickly in the light. The frame rate does occasionally struggle in this mode, but I personally found it worth putting up with for the sake of the visuals. Performance, meanwhile, is silky smooth, but you’re getting a much-simplified lighting model in return. For a game like this, I know which I prefer.</p>


<p>One of the most interesting things about playing Little Nightmares in co-op, is the way the atmosphere permeates your experience of the game. You’ll talk in hushed tones, you’ll call out at the same time, you’ll skulk in silence together, waiting for the right moment to dash across a decaying room, or run from the suddenly-frantic monster at your tail. It definitely alters how the game feels, but the tension, the pressure and grim visual design work as well as they ever have done.</p>
<p>Despite the extremely curated pathway through the game, Supermassive Games (taking over from original series developers Tarsier Studios) manage to bring enough variation and new ideas to present some significant hurdles to your progress. It’s not hard, per se, barring a few unexpectedly cheap deaths or surprisingly harsh moments of combat, but there’s environmental puzzles to sort out, and the way forward isn’t always clear. Communication is key, and if you’re playing as a pair, working together to find the way through is suitably satisfying.</p>
<p>Playing solo is a different experience again. Like in its predecessor, whichever character you don’t pick will be controlled by the AI. Here, you become the leader, with the largely silent follower simply mimicking your actions. Overall, the AI is smart enough to prevent frustration, though occasionally you have to call them over with a hushed “Hey” to get them to engage with what you want them to. Once or twice they also proved just a spot too slow during combat, but they were still more reliable than a human counterpart.</p>

<p>The companionship of the two characters is gently touching. The way they reach for each other, or lift each other up, brings the game some much-needed humanity amidst the otherworldly decay and corruption. Their diminutive frames are unbelievably weak and small, but they have no option but to move forward. That indomitable spirit gives you strength and purpose through Little Nightmares 3, because you want to save them, you want to free them from this horrific dream.</p>
<p>As before, each chapter of Little Nightmares 3 shifts through a different area and a primary antagonist, and how effective they are as nightmare-fuel may rely on your own personal fears. The first section sees you evading a giant doll-baby, plucked scalp and baleful eyes a terrifying contrast to the chubby arms and hands reaching through the side of buildings, seeking out giant rattles, bringing the roof down or grabbing at a tolling bell.</p>

<p>The DualSense is also used to fantastic effect to heighten the imposing stature of this horrible thing, and even when the monster is stomping away in the distance, you can feel its presence through your hands. I think, as a parent, this felt like a particularly hard-hitting start, but later creations ramp up the cold creepiness and ghastly, gruesome atmosphere even further. Is it the best the series has ever been? I think it falls short of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares 2</a>, though whether that’s also partly due to the change in atmosphere from playing in co-op, it’s hard to say.</p>
<p>The slight mechanical clunkiness of its predecessors remains in Little Nightmares 3, and that is, if anything, amplified by the inclusion of two players. It’s easy to get stuck, for one player to knock the other out of step just before a jump, or to be unable to quite find the space next to them, and it will lead to a few frustrating deaths. Each save point is normally just a doorway back though, and those light frustrations are ironed out and soon forgotten as you continue ever further into these grotesque imaginings.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-yooka-replaylee-switch-2-feels-like-the-game-it-was-meant-to-be-finally.1319629/</guid>

<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159427/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>11 (!) years ago, a bunch of ex-Rare staff formed a studio called Playtonic to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> that promised to skillfully carry the 3D platforming torch. Yet when the actual game launched in 2017, following an incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign, it didn’t <em>fully</em> deliver on that promise.</p>
<p>Players were met with a passionately crafted, but somewhat janky experience that some (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">like me</a>) loved and others hated, and the cool reception resulted in the titular duo having a mixed reputation. Now, Playtonic has decided to make things right with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, and I’m happy to report that the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that original promise.</p>
<p>First off, what exactly <em>is</em> Yooka-Replaylee? Though it’s debatable whether this qualifies as a full-blown remake of the original, it’s immediately apparent that this goes far beyond a mere remaster that simply improves performance and visuals.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159441/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yooka-Laylee was the epitome of a flawed gem, and Playtonic clearly took to heart the criticism the initial release received and used it to make this second pass a much stronger showing. Things like tighter controls, fast travel, a map, and loads more collectibles change up the gameplay experience in some important and very positive ways, rounding off those rougher edges that caused some players to bounce off the original.</p>
<p>The overall structure remains unchanged, as the titular duo explores the central hub and its five worlds in search of dozens of Pagies, a certain number of which is needed to unlock the next world in the progression. Once you drop into a world, there are around 50 Pagies scattered around the environment to collect, which can be picked up in whatever order you want.</p>
<p>Exploration is expedited and a lot smoother this time around because our heroes have not only had their moveset retooled to feel much smoother, but also have all their abilities unlocked from the beginning. The devs also more than doubled the Pagie count for this release, which has gone a <em>long</em> way towards making the worlds feel less empty. The environments are still pretty spacious, however, especially given that they’re now by default in their ‘expanded’ state.</p>

<p>To make them feel less daunting, Playtonic added a cute bookmark NPC named Mark who you can not only fast travel to at various points on the map, but also pay to reveal the location of Pagies you haven’t found yet. I wasn’t exactly disappointed by the design and depth of the worlds in the initial release, but the work Playtonic has done here to streamline traversal and progression through them has absolutely changed them for the better.</p>
<p>In addition to Pagies, there are also oodles of coins and quills scattered in each level. The former can be traded to Vendi in exchange for equippable Tonics that modify difficulty settings and myriad cosmetic changes, while the latter can be traded to Trowser for things like energy and Tonic slot upgrades to make the protagonists a bit more durable.</p>
<p>Overall, I was really pleased at how thoughtfully they balanced the economy here - even finding these ‘currency’ collectibles feels exciting due to the sheer variety of stuff you can purchase.</p>
<p>Taking a step back and seeing all these gameplay changes really puts into perspective how much effort Playtonic put in to polish and improve their debut release. Yooka-Laylee was never a bad game, but it had some quirks and flaws that occasionally got in the way of the fun, and just about every one of those drawbacks has been modified or addressed in some way here.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159424/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve seen it argued that Playtonic would’ve been better served putting such effort into a true sequel, but I’d say that the changes here bring this duo’s first 3D entry up to par (in terms of quality) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yooka-laylee_and_the_impossible_lair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>. A lush, real-life orchestral recording of the original soundtrack only adds to that feeling of quality.</p>
<p>As far as the visuals are concerned, Yooka-Replaylee is a clear improvement on its predecessor but a little less so with this Switch 2 port. The good news is that the environments feature much richer detail and better lighting, giving them a far more vibrant and alluring atmosphere compared to the occasionally flat presentation of the original.</p>
<p>The bad news? The frame rate is capped at a disappointing (but stable) 30fps, which can make the action look a little bit choppy at times. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yooka-replaylee-runs-at-30fps-on-switch-2-team-investigating-performance-mode">The devs have said</a> they’re looking into a potential post-launch performance boost after "limited time" with the Switch 2 dev kits restricted their ability to design for it, but right now it's still up in the air whether that patch will ever materialise.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159445/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also encountered a few bugs on my playthrough that ranged from amusing to annoying. After leaving the Switch 2 in sleep mode for a few hours, I returned to the game to find that there was no sound and after about 10 minutes of playing without it, the game simply crashed and I was booted back to the Home Screen. In another instance, whacking a treasure chest next to a wall caused my duo to clip through the level geometry and tumble into a formless black void, never to return.</p>
<p>Hiccups like this weren’t <em>too</em> common in my experience, but they also weren’t exactly uncommon, either. I'm hoping the team will address these at some point after launch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee, in most ways, feels like the game that Yooka-Laylee was always meant to be. The core experience has remained the same, but much has been added or tweaked to make for a significantly more confident and streamlined experience.</p>
<p>Though the technical issues hold it back a bit, at least on Switch 2 at launch, this is still a clear improvement over the original and a game that no fan of the 3D platforming genre should miss out on. Even if you played the original to completion, I’d say Yooka-Replaylee is still very much worth your time and money.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bye-sweet-carole-review-a-gorgeously-terrifying-journey-through-grief.1319626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A dash of classic Disney aesthetic mixed with nightmare fuel creatures is strung together by an evocative story of grief and growth in&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d49d913-b71c-4d34-9676-14c5be241406" href="https://techraptor.net/games/bye-sweet-carole" rel="nofollow"><em>Bye Sweet Carole</em></a>. Revolving around Bunny Hall orphanage, the combination of narrative segments and puzzle platformer gameplay invites you to immerse yourself in the world of Lana as she works through the disappearance of her best friend, Carole.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;begins with Lana waking up in a place she doesn't recall. If you grew up in the early Disney era, you may instantly feel nostalgic. The illustrations of the title, all hand-drawn, are reminiscent of <em>Snow White.&nbsp;</em>There are even cute birds that speak with her, telling her she has returned to her kingdom of Corolla. She begins to chase after a letter, then ends up getting chased by a mysterious tar creature through murky water.</p>

<p>This is the first taste of the two different ways the game plays out: a narrative scene and gameplay. Cutscenes are akin to short films. A narrator may set up the current information or recent changes, characters interact with each other, and memories are discovered. During gameplay, you're set in a specific place and have to solve different puzzles to move the story forward. This combination allows you to absorb the story as well as experience it.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-design-mailbox.jpg?itok=-rCoTQHT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-design-mailbox.jpg?itok=GtbX173D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What pushes Lana forward? A letter signed by her best friend Carole, who has gone missing in recent weeks. Seeking to find out what happened to her, she chases after the letter up a tree, over a wall, and through a pond. This need to obtain the letter and track down Carole is Lana's motivation throughout the game. You get snippets of Lana's life, her relationship with Carole, and experience more of the Kingdom of Corolla, the other world merging with the world of mortals. Divided by chapter, you'll find yourself exploring areas of the orphanage lost to time, following the letter through the remnants of Corolla, and facing off against the villainous Mr. Kyn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the game continues, the length of time you spend in each chapter can increase. Puzzles become more intricate, or more items are necessary to unlock the next location. You're able to change form into a rabbit about a quarter of the way through&nbsp;the game, allowing you to bounce off walls, crawl through small spaces, or execute higher jumps.&nbsp;You're not alone on the journey, at least not completely. Some chapters will have a helper for Lana, allowing her to bypass difficult barriers on her path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I sat there playing, I began to get the distinct feeling that&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;was similar to&nbsp;<em>The Babadook<b>,&nbsp;</b></em>at least in essence. Lana is a young girl overwhelmed by the world around her, and without her best friend by her side, she cannot deal with her emotions. She's forgotten about Corolla, her mother, and the events that surrounded Carole's disappearance. Her <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3489024b-2d33-41b0-bc6c-5882c3d0c913" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interview/lost-words-beyond-page-grief" rel="nofollow">grief</a> has taken over everything else in her life. As she works to find any hint about Carole and help restore the Kingdom of Corolla, she begins to work through that grief.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-hiding-hold-breath.jpg?itok=r4Jb9Ev7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-hiding-hold-breath.jpg?itok=kzyJRxzH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's not all doom and gloom, though. There's plenty to explore and experience. Objects you can look at, use, or collect are highlighted as you go through each location. Running causes bottles or decorative plates to shatter on the ground. Hunters, those infected by Mr. Kyn's tar, give chase when they hear the slightest sound. Hiding places are abound, but you need to reach them and hold your breath to find safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with enemies around every corner, there are only two real combat sequences in <i>Bye Sweet Carole</i>. Most of the action occurs when being chased or trying to avoid dying. Quick time events (QTEs) liven things up while searching an area. There are a few different events, including smashing a button to free yourself from a trap, moving the joystick to maintain balance, or timing dance moves to earn a perfect score. These mesh with the movement actions you take to keep you from simply watching the game tell the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the title has some exciting chase moments, the overall pacing of&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole&nbsp;</em>is on the slower side. You're meant to walk throughout the different areas (unless you're being hunted), explore the various items you can interact with, and take in the cutscene sequences without skipping them. For those who enjoy fast-paced games, you'll potentially find yourself wanting more action as the game continues. You can skip cutscenes and conversations, but the impact of the story can be missed just by overlooking those small moments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of the pacing not being everyone's cup of tea, there were a couple of bugs encountered in my playthrough. The most prominent was Hunters getting stuck in certain areas, instead of moving along a pre-established path. One enemy even had a shadow of itself appear, making it difficult to continue through the stealth necessary area. Some minor differences between the subtitles and spoken lines are also present. However, an indie studio crafting such a clean title with glitches that only impact the game in small ways is an impressive feat.</p>

<p>Even though the pacing may be a bit slow for my taste,&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;is a narrative delight that shines a light on the confusion and despair that accompany grief, especially for children in a fast-changing world. Impactful, heartwarming, and thought-provoking, the story is etched in every aspect of the title. With easy-to-grasp mechanics and a variety of QTEs, the game is accessible to all types of players, not just experts in platforming or puzzles. Tied together with gorgeous illustrations, a well-written plot, and cleanly designed gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;is ready to be a success for developer Little Sewing Machine.&nbsp;</p>
