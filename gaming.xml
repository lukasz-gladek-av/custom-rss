            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry is in turmoil. Its workers are reeling from years’ worth of record layoffs and game cancellations. Entire video game studios shut down, “starved of both funding and support,” <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Luke put it earlier this week</a>. And yet, Summer Game Fest persists. I’ve been covering Summer Game Fest and E3 before it for years, but this year felt different: Largely because I had no idea what to expect as a reporter newly laid off and free from the responsibility of the yearly <em>Everything announced at Summer Game Fest</em> post. But there was one thing I was certain would happen: suits and sneakers.</p><p>I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with a suit with sneakers. But it has to be the right suit and the right sneakers. Geoff Keighley’s first big premiere of the night, as Kotaku’s Ethan Gach put it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lqxq7w2eu22m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlueSky</a>, was his new sneakers — a $750 pair of bright yellow Lanvin tennis shoes. Beyond the luxury price tag, I actually think these sneakers are quite good. I like yellow! In fact, it’s my favorite color. They’re an homage — or ripoff? — of a classic Adidas shoe, and I love the translucent rubber cupsole.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that the suit is totally wrong. The pant length needed to be hemmed. The dark gray suit should have been black — or some totally different color. (There’s a muted green version of these Lanvin shoes on the brand’s website,<a href="https://us.lanvin.com/collections/men-shoes-sneakers/products/clay-mesh-sneakers-fu-skdk00-tona-p25414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> shown with a matching pair of green dress pants</a>, and it looks great. I am not sure Geoff could have pulled off yellow pants to match with the yellow shoes, but I certainly could have!) Lastly, please, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-fashion-geoff-keighley-hideo-kojima-1849864018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditch the T-shirt</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>The way the suit absolutely ruined the sneakers was made so clear by Geoff bringing the impeccably dressed Hideo Kojima on the stage (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joshscherr.bsky.social/post/3lqxqoimw7222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in record time?</a>). Kojima opted for a pair of Acronym x MSCHF kicks he posted about in 2024, <a href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appropriately dressed in stylish techwear</a>. His shoes are flashy, but they make sense for the event <em>and</em>, crucially, Kojima’s outfit.</p><p>The only other suit, T-shirt, and sneaker combo I recall on the Summer Game Fest stage was on Hakan Abrak of IO Interactive. (Co-host Lucy James was wearing sneakers, too, with a gorgeous blue dress. She looked great!) It was as non-offensive as the combination goes, but he and Geoff had the misfortune of standing next to Mads Mikkelson, who — while still wearing a T-shirt and a blazer — rightly chose a nice pair of dress shoes.</p><figure></figure><p>The world may be on fire, but perhaps we can all find comfort in the fact that the fashion at Summer Game Fest will never change.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/06/devolver-digital-reveals-ball-x-pit-a-brick-breaking-survival-roguelite-that-looks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Devolver Digital has revealed Ball x Pit, a brick-breaking, base-building survival roguelite that looks like the next indie time sink I can't wait to jump into. There's a demo out today on PC, and it's launching on Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year (here's hoping it makes its way to PlayStation 5 one day, too). This was revealed as part of today's Devolver Direct, which went with a different approach to its summer showcase this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the zanier off-the-wall antics of the annual summer Devolver Direct, which usually contains multiple announcements, it released a documentary called "BALL x PIT: The Kenny Sun Story," alongside a trailer for the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can view the Ball x Pit reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"In Ball x Pit, Ballbylon has fallen," a press release reads. "After a meteoric and completely unexpected event annihilated the great city, all that remains is an ominous, yawning pit. Treasure hunters far and wide flock to the city's tomb to seek their fortune, plundering the depths in search of Ballbylon's scattered riches. Few return.</p><p>"The pit plays host to armies of barbaric creatures, hellbent on ending your quest before it even begins. Armed with a growing arsenal of magic-infused projectiles, batter your way through multiple levels of increasingly challenging obstacles to claim the ultimate prizes and rebuild New Ballbylon. With every glob you lob, gain valuable experience to develop overpowered spitball combinations, and recruit additional heroes to unlock new skills to send the gutter-dwelling goons packing."&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see in the Ball x Pit trailer above, it fuses quite a few different gameplay mechanics to create a roguelite. There's classic brick-breaking action (with Vampire Survivors-like explosions of numbers all over the screen), base-building, and survival gameplay, all morphed into one experience as you attempt run after run. It features over 60 randomized balls to equip, 70 unique buildings for New Ballbylon that provide gameplay bonuses, power-ups, and characters, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>You can try out Ball x Pit on PC via a new Steam demo right now before it launches on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new adventure through "space, time, and the streets of Toronto"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've got some exciting news for Scott Pilgrim fans, with Tribute Games announcing it's teaming up with Universal and the series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to release an "all-new, action-packed" video game entry on multiple platforms including the Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Pilgrim EX</strong> is set to arrive in "early 2026" and will reimagine the fan-favourite universe with its modern approach to traditional brawlers. Here's some official PR about what exactly you can expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Players take on the role of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers and more of the all-star crew to battle a variety of enemies in a warped version of Toronto overrun by demons, vegan henchmen and robots in an epic quest to save the city.</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>"With hard-hitting combat and explosive art, <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX reinvents classic 2D brawling for a new era, blending high-energy action with fun character progression. Each of the seven playable characters features a full move set from the start, but players can customize their experience through upgradeable stats, and equippable special items making every fighter feel truly personal. Players will be able to dive into a brand-new storyline, co-written by Bryan Lee O’Malley and the team at Tribute Games. They can also unleash creative combos, wield wild weapons, and brawl through co-op action—set to all-new music by Anamanaguchi —as <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> EX delivers a bold new chapter for longtime fans and newcomers alike."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the creator, who is deeply involved in this project, Anamanaguchi will also be returning to provide an explosive blend of 8-bit and "hyper-melodic rock". Pixel artist Paul Robertson is also helping out Tribute's in-house team on character animations and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off director and showrunner Ben David Grabinski is also on board as a creative consultant.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/680659/day-of-the-devs-2025-summer-game-fest<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that Summer Game Fest 2025 is off and running, it’s time for my favorite part of the show: Day of the Devs. Day of the Devs is a yearly showcase highlighting the newest, quirkiest indie releases, and it is frequently the source of some of my favorite games SGF has on offer. This year is another banger slate of titles from your favorite indie publishers, like Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive, Panic, and more. I’ll have more to share about these games once the show is over, but for now, here are my faves from the Day of the Devs Summer Game Fest showcase 2025.</p><div><p id="snap-and-grab"><h3>Snap and Grab</h3></p></div><p><em>Snap and Grab</em> is a slick-looking action puzzle game that mixes <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> with <em>Miami Vice</em>. Set in the hyper neon aesthetic of the ’80s, <em>Snap and Grab</em> lets you live out your master thief fantasies. Case the joint with your camera, taking pictures of the merchandise you wanna steal while also snapping pics of the people, places, and things that’ll help your team get the goods and get out. Coming next year to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles.</p><div><p id="big-walk"><h2>Big Walk</h2></p></div><p>It’s time to take a <em>gander </em>at the next game from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic">Untitled Goose Game</a></em> developer House House. In <em>Big Walk</em>, House House combines the peacefulness of a walking simulator with the wacky hijinks of multiplayer party games. You and your friends will take a… well, big walk through the countryside finding and solving puzzles using the game’s unique proximity voice and text chat feature. </p><div><p id="sword-of-the-sea"><h3>Sword of the Sea </h3></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2453160%2FSword_of_the_Sea%2F" rel="sponsored">Sword of the Sea</a></em> is from the makers of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8798505/abzu-e3-2015-hands-on">Abzu</a></em> and <em>The Pathless</em>. It’s a skateboarding exploration narrative game in which you cruise around a desert world doing flips off dunes and sandy half-pipes. <em>Sword of the Sea</em> features music by Austin Wintory and very much reminds me of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22699023/sable-review-xbox-steam">Sable</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22972989/journey-10-year-anniversary-multiplayer-jenova-chen-austin-wintory">Journey</a></em>, but with a Tony Hawk twist.</p><div><p id="escape-academy-2"><h3>Escape Academy 2</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23218887/escape-academy-review-xbox-playstation-escape-room-puzzle-game">I <em>loved</em> the first <em>Escape Academy</em></a> and I’m incredibly geeked that the team at Coin Crew Games is back with a sequel. In <em>Escape Academy 2</em>, the developers gave the people what we wanted: a bigger school with even more puzzles to solve. And now, instead of selecting levels, you can find the puzzles yourself in an open-world explorable academy filled with secrets and clues. Unfollow me now, this is gonna be the only thing I talk about for the next week. </p><div><p id="dosa-divas"><h3>Dosa Divas</h3></p></div><p><em>Dosa Divas</em> from <em>Thirsty Suitors</em> developer Outerloop Games is a spicy RPG that’ll make you hungry. In the game, you collect recipes and use them in cooking minigames to make food for people who have been overcome by a violent case of the itis. <em>Dosa Diva</em>’s turn-based combat features dodges <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad">and</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good">parries</a>, which makes the game well situated to take advantage of the turn-based RPG hype generated by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</a></p><div><p id="consume-me"><h3>Consume Me</h3></p></div><p>Never before has a game attacked me so violently, but in a way that still makes me really want to play it. <em>Consume Me</em> is a coming-of-age story that pays homage to the unique hell of being a teenage girl. Stress about your grades (rude), crushes (also rude), and weight (RUDE AS FUCK!) via a collection of <em>WarioWare</em>-esque minigames. This game looks like it’ll cause me a unique amount of stress. I can’t wait.</p><div><p id="possessors"><h3>Possessor(s)</h3></p></div><p>Heart Machine, maker of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4819852/hyper-light-drifter-report">Hyper Light Drifter</a> </em>and this year’s <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/14/23640021/hyper-light-breaker-first-gameplay-trailer-steam-early-access">Hyper Light Breaker</a>,</em> is back with its next game, <em>Possessor(s).</em> In the game, you play as Luca, who has been forced into cooperation with the demon Rhem. Luca uses Rhem’s powers to fight demons that have invaded their city. Together the two must solve the mystery of their world while exploring their ruined city in a search action adventure game (what the kids are calling Metroidvanias these days).</p><div><p id="relooted"><h3>Relooted </h3></p></div><p>Another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer">side-scrolling action game steeped in afrofuturistic fantasy</a>? Don’t mind if I do! <em>Relooted</em> is a new game from South African-based developer Nyamakop. It combines endless-runner action with an <em>Indiana Jones</em>-type story. In the game, you and your friends team up to steal your culture’s artifacts back from the museums that stole them in the first place. As you run through each location, your friends are standing by, ready to use their powers to clear any obstacles to ensure you’ve got a smooth path. </p><p>These games aren’t all Day of the Devs 2025 has to offer. You can check out the full list of games <a href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/games/">here</a> and stay tuned to <em>The Verge</em>’s Summer Game Fest 2025 coverage to see more from these titles later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The beta will include two new characters, one with telekinesis (Kae) and the other with a jetpack (Adrian). Additionally, the beta will add three new explorable points of interest, new daily missions, a revamped mission system, and other improvements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/wildgate-official-announcement-trailer">first announced back in March</a>.

In March, alongside the announcement of Wildgate, he told us that he still hopes Dreamhaven can eventually be a beacon for the industry as he proclaimed he wanted it to be when the company first launched, but clarified his vision a bit:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Really what I want to see happen is for Dreamhaven to build a reputation with gamers that the brand stands for something, a seal of quality, hopefully, that hopefully there's some trust that we've built up where players know that if a game is coming from Dreamhaven, regardless of genre, that it's going to be something very special and they'll want to have the curiosity to check it out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Summer Game Fest right here</a>, and stick with us for everything coming this weekend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">from IGN Live</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It's a new roguelike game made by developer Brownies that looks reminiscent of Hades, but derived instead from Eastern mysticism.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to piece together much about Towa just from the trailer, but from what we can tell it's a roguelike similar to Hades with a top-down view, action combat, and the ability to choose upgrades at certain junctures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Towa appears to feature a cast of multiple characters to choose from who are all working together to fight some sort of demon bent on destroying the world, and you seem to be able to have multiple at once in the field fighting enemies. All the characters and the aesthetics of the world they inhabit are heavily steeped in classic Japanese art, and among the cast is what appears to be, delightfully, a giant shiba and a large talking koi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Summer Game Fest right here</a>, and stick with us for everything coming this weekend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">from IGN Live</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Another year, another Geoff</p>
</section></header><section>
<p>Okay, okay, we know you're incredibly busy right now playing the Switch 2. We understand, and it's all good.</p>
<p><em>However</em>. If you're interested in what this year's Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase has to offer, then you've come to the right place. We're streaming the event live right here when it all kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 2pm PDT / 3pm MDT / 4pm CDT / 5pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 10pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 11pm CEST / 12am (Sat) EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 6am (Sat) JST / 5am (Sat) AWST / 7am (Sat) AEST</li></ul>

<p>As for what might be announced, well... we don't really know right now. A lot of focus seems to be on Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> for the PS5, so we're fully expecting Geoff Keighley and Kojima to spend a good 10-15 minutes doing some sort of secret handshake on-stage.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a whole bunch of partners has been confirmed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-switch-2-listed-as-a-summer-game-fest-2025-partner">including 'Nintendo Switch 2'</a>, so it's likely we'll see a few notable announcements for Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>So grab a snack, settle in, and enjoy... Or go back to playing Switch 2, whatever you want.</p>

<figure><a title="Pro Controller 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37abd35a25ad0/pro-controller-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Moving from the Switch 1 Pro Controller to the Switch 2 Pro Controller, Nintendo has largely taken the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ route. Keeping the same basic layout intact, it instead applied several small, but significant improvements to make this latest iteration the very best Nintendo controller I’ve ever had the pleasure of using.</p>
<p>So, looking at the design of the new pad, it all looks pretty familiar, but there are a few changes that should be noted.</p>
<p>For starters, the grips are ever-so-slightly slimmer than the previous model, which in my case made it much more comfortable in the hand. My index fingers rest perfectly on the ‘ZL’ and ‘ZR’ triggers, while the rest of my fingers fall naturally on the grips below. As for the general feel, the matt black/grey finish is wonderful, though it does invite plenty of dust.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the face buttons have been slightly enlarged; not so much that it’s immediately noticeable by sight, but you can really feel the difference in the hand. They’re close enough together that your thumb essentially rests on two buttons at once diagonally, making it easy to rock back and forth to hit whichever one you want.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest improvement comes with those analogue sticks. Good <em>lord</em>, they feel incredible. The standard Joy-Con controllers have been improved in a similar way, with the sticks feeling much smoother than on the Switch 1. With the Pro Controller, this is far more pronounced thanks to the extra travel afforded by the larger sticks.</p>
<p>It’s so difficult to describe exactly how smooth the motion feels; it’s one of those things where if you know, you <em>know</em>. That said, if you want a bit of a fun attempt at a rundown, then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olJH2tQgREE">Alex’s video</a>, in which he demonstrates with a bottle and an oily spoon. (Look, just trust me). Rest assured, the slight grinding you'd feel on the original Pro Controller is now completely gone.</p>
<p>Moving onto the D-pad, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/18ztfbf/holy_crap_the_pro_controllers_dpad_is_horrible/">sensitivity issues some people had</a> with the Switch 1 Pro Controller appear to have been fixed here, though we’ll need to really put it through its paces over the coming months (and years) to see if it holds up.</p>

<p>Testing the D-pad within the calibration settings reveals that rocking it up and down while holding down left or right does still yield ‘up’ and ‘down’ inputs, but it’s not nearly as sensitive as the previous controller. In fact, you want it to happen a <em>bit</em> so you can easily pull off diagonal inputs. Playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was easily able to knock out a few combos and Hadoukens without any fuss, and retro games via Nintendo Switch Online felt similarly natural with the D-pad.</p>
<p>Over on the back, you’ve also got the new ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons, which can be remapped to whatever you wish on a game-by-game basis. We’ve already noted that you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-got-a-switch-2-pro-controller-this-little-capture-trick-is-a-game-changer">map the capture button to the back</a>, which is a bit of a game-changer for more fast-paced games in which you want to take a few snaps.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can map whatever input you wish, so it can certainly come in handy when you want to sprint and jump at the same time in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, for example.</p>
<figure><a title="Pro Controller 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8798e564fe271/pro-controller-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The positioning of the back buttons feels pretty natural, too. I mentioned that my fingers rested comfortably on the grips, and this is exactly where ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ are placed, but if you’re worried about accidentally pressing them, fear not. You can comfortably move your middle fingers up slightly to rest on the back of the pad – pretty much right where the ‘Nintendo’ logo is located. But even this isn’t entirely necessary in my opinion; my fingers curve around the buttons enough that I don’t feel they’re ever going to be pressed unless I consciously want to.</p>
<p>The dinky face buttons — i.e. your home button, capture button, '+', '–', and GameChat button — are all tucked away quite neatly in the middle of the device. The capture button specifically could be in a <em>slightly</em> easier-to-reach location, but it's at least out of the way enough that you're probably never going to hit it accidentally.</p>
<p>With the 'C' button, it's the same deal. You know where it is, so it's easily reachable whenever you want to access the Switch 2's GameChat menu, but you need to consciously reach your thumb over to get at it. What's odd is that, thanks to the right analogue stick next to it, the GameChat button looks slightly off-centre. It's not — you can tell by looking at its positioning in relation to the home and capture buttons above — but next to the analogue stick, it looks a little... weird.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the other big change with the Pro Controller 2 is the addition of a 3.5mm headphone jack - can I get a 'hallelujah!'? Yes, this is a lovely little addition that makes discreet audio an absolute breeze if you happen to be gaming late at night. Something to keep in mind is that you'll need to make sure your controller is fully updated before hooking up a headset - thankfully, the Switch itself lets you know that you're due one if you plug anything into the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Positioning the audio jack at the bottom is just about the best place for it, too. You've got a standard USB-C slot at the top for your charging needs, so you can easily plug in both a headset and a charging cable without much fuss.</p>
<p>Speaking of the top, you'll notice now that the entire area housing the shoulder buttons, USB-C slot, and sync button is now white, as are the 'shafts' for the analogue sticks. This is a nice little design decision that easily sets the new pad apart from its predecessor, but I can also understand if it doesn't appeal to those looking for a more uniform look.</p>
<p>As for the shoulder buttons themselves, these feel nice and clicky without producing too much noise. No analogue functionality for the 'ZL' and 'ZR' buttons, sadly, but the digital inputs work perfectly well enough. Truth be told, this is probably the one area of the pad that's required the least amount of tinkering from Nintendo, and it all feels just as good as ever.</p>

<p>One last thing to touch on is the HD Rumble 2, which definitely feels a lot more robust than the original Pro Controller (and quieter too), but still not quite on par with the PS5's haptic feedback. It feels really nice, though; moving between menu options on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> produces small, yet welcome feedback, while powersliding during races feels appropriately gnarly without distracting you from the action on-screen.</p>
<p>Really, it's hard to find much fault with it. Time will be the true test, of course, and it certainly isn't cheap. I'll be keeping a close eye on any potential drifting issues or D-pad shenanigans, but after using it as my primary controller for 99% of the time with my Switch 2 thus far, it's proven to be a magical little accessory; a new benchmark in Nintendo controller design. I've not yet tried the PS5's DualSense Edge, but I feel confident in saying that this $85 pad feels better than Xbox's $200 Elite Controller.</p>

<figure><a title="Wind Waker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fb262cb808a5f/wind-waker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest surprises with the Switch 2 is the bonus addition of Nintendo GameCube games for subscribers to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The opening line-up is slightly slim, sure, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> are all absolute bangers.</p>
<p>Some of you may have also picked up the new wireless GameCube controller to go with your new subscriber perk, and it's definitely an incredibly faithful recreation of the original classic. Like previous NSO catalogues, however, using the GameCube controller yields a few fun surprises in the main menu, as seen in the below video from Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akfamilyhome.com/post/3lqukwcsb5c2e">AK</a>.</p>

<p>So when using the controller, the usual red interface will change to purple to match the overall colour scheme of the GameCube, while a bunch of sound effects have also been added in. There are definitely a few we've noticed from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It's a neat little easter egg, albeit one that's been done before. Still, it's pretty cool to see that Nintendo still has its sense of fun, even if this isn't immediately apparent with the main Switch 2 UI.</p>

<p>It’s more often than not these days that a game released in an underwhelming state is left abandoned in a pool of its own minor updates. On occasion, though, we have a redemption arc like that belonging to 2020's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/cyberpunk_2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>Originally released in a state that was barely functional and riddled with more bugs than an anteater’s digestive tract, it’s safe to say that CD Projekt Red has not only redeemed its reputation, but the game is now celebrated as one of the strongest RPGs of the decade.</p>
<p>Somehow, this goliath of neon violence is now on Nintendo Switch 2 as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, but how does a handheld deal with this phoenix-like, vindicated video game?</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156542/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, firstly, this release comes with some swanky new controls. The most immediately impressive is gyro aiming, not a revolutionary idea by any stretch in 2025, but a hugely welcome addition that can really help with fine adjustments during gunplay. CDPR have also added a swathe of different options on how it can be implemented, adjusting sensitivity, when gyro becomes enabled (for example, only when you’re aiming down sights), and even how much your movements are dampened to avoid twitchy nonsense.</p>
<p>Mouse controls are also an option, but they don’t feel quite as natural and well-realised. The game’s frame rate (more on that to come) limits responsiveness, but this could easily be a limitation of my own experience with mouse controls at lower frame rates; I’m certain there’s <em>someone</em> out there who will wonder how they ever lived without it, and more power to whoever you are. Frankly, I'd always rather have an option available and not use it, than not have it at all.</p>
<p>I did notice some inconsistencies with some actions, though, most notably reloading. For some reason hitting the 'Y' button just didn’t always initiate a reload, to the point that I tested the Joy-Con 2 in the system settings to make sure it wasn’t faulty, but it seems to be entirely specific to this control method. Hopefully this is nothing more than an oversight that can be patched in the future.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156581/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last on the new control methods is ‘Motion Patterns’, a method that uses motion controls not just for aiming, but gestures for reloading, using health items, and more besides. It’s locked behind the T-Bug tutorial from the start of the game, and for good reason. I can only imagine some hapless sod turning it on by mistake and wondering why they’re using up their health items every time they scratch their nose. It’s only available when using two Joy-Con 2 <em>without</em> a grip, Wii Remote and Nunchuk-style, and a fun little distraction for a while, but despite its good reliability and responsiveness, it’s not something I felt any desire to enable outside of testing.</p>
<p>But onto the game itself. You play as V, and much like most RPGs with a custom character creator, V can be anything you want — male, female, young, old (ish) — it’s entirely your call, and the residents of Night City could not care less about any of it. They’ve got their own problems.</p>
<p>V is, however, a criminal to some degree, just like practically everyone else in the city. Law and order exists officially, but gangs roam the streets, taking hostages and murdering civilians without blinking if they think it’ll bag them some Eurodollars, or ‘eddies’.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156577/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the first things you’ll notice upon entering Night City is just how detailed and narratively well-built this fictitious world is; Night City feels like it could actually be a real-life place in many ways; with its blend of ramshackle streets and ultra-wealthy districts, it's shockingly believable. Culture, fashion, technology, language, it all feels like looking at a warped reflection of our own world, frighteningly well-realised, and terrifyingly bleak in so many ways. Yet that’s the joy of the world of Cyberpunk 2077 - you can see so much of the real world within its fantasy setting, only with more swearing. A lot more swearing.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, Night City, and Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole, is very much an adult experience. Part of that is the sexual imagery plastered everywhere, the violence, the truly vile language, but more than that, it’s the characters, the dialogue, and the raging rapids of emotions you’re forced to contend with.</p>
<p>You see, V isn’t alone. Lodged in their synapses they also have the personality of a long-dead terrorist and rockerboy Johnny Silverhand, breathtakingly realised by Keanu Reeves. Silverhand is slowly taking over V’s mind and body, but even he’s not entirely happy about it. The journey these two are forced to share is one of betrayal, death, impossible choices, and a hell of a lot more besides. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Cyberpunk 2077’s story might be one of the best you’re likely to come across.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156537/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s more impressive is how it presents itself. Just like CD Projekt Red’s previous efforts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, the line between primary story mission and side mission is furiously blurred. You might accept a mission that sounds basic and almost one-dimensional at first, only to be thrust into an entirely different thread of Night City’s ever-changing story. A simple spark of jealousy from a client fearing their relationship isn’t as stable as they’d thought can spiral out of control into a multi-mission omnibus that asks you to define how far someone needs to go before they might no longer be considered human. A lighthearted romp for all the family.</p>
<p>I found myself second-guessing what missions were deemed ‘main story’ for a while, because the side missions get just as much care and attention poured into them. Chances are you won’t even see all of them on your first time through either, as seemingly minor decisions you make at various points can have a noticeable impact on what characters and missions are available to you as you progress.</p>
<p>You’ll most likely not even realise, though. Hell, I’ve probably missed some massive missions I would have loved because of some seemingly innocuous dialogue option. It gives the game this great sense of replayability, heightened further by its other mechanics.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156544/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll be doing a fair bit of fighting in Night City and its outskirts, and you need to decide how you plan to go about staying alive. You can focus on melee weapons, gunplay, or ‘netrunning’, which is arguably the game’s magic system. But as the old saying goes, the proof of the meat is in the detail, and Cyberpunk 2077 provides an awful lot of variance within these three categories.</p>
<p>Melee weapons range from hammers, to hinged blades that burst from your forearms, to a glowing wire that, again, comes out of your arms somehow. Guns can be powerful enough to shoot through certain walls, charged for extra wallop, or clever enough to fire their bullets around corners and directly into your victim’s skull. Netrunning enables hacking into nearby systems on the fly, letting you explode (presumably smart) fuel canisters, or even send a computer virus into your enemies causing a visceral illness that spreads between any other nasty person that might be standing too close.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156533/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is only scratching the surface of the flexibility available to you, and this goes even further with cyberware. As you might expect, cyberware is a load of cybernetics you wear. Well, not so much <em>wear</em> as have implanted into your nervous system, legs, brain, the whole megillah. You can have these implanted at various locations by certified ripperdocs, meaning you can’t change them yourself when you’re wandering around a nightclub or mooching around your flat. Probably for the best.</p>
<p>Every piece of cyberware comes with bonuses, some simple, like a faster rate of healing, and some that give you entirely new abilities, such as being able to jump ten metres into the air. You also have a skill tree to manage, which is thankfully fairly straightforward in isolation, and allows you to rework your unlocks whenever you like.</p>
<p>The customisation on offer in Cyberpunk 2077 is astonishingly broad, rewarding, and beautifully realised, but we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t perhaps <em>a little</em> overwhelming, even after tens of hours of play. It’s unavoidable, really; offer a magnitude of possibilities and you’re inevitably going to leave players somewhat paralysed by choice. My advice? Just dive in, don’t think too much about it. You can always make some more eddies if you want to change things later. Or just go with your choices and save the other stuff for a subsequent playthrough.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156539/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the processes for these elements are comparatively straightforward. Crafting, for example, is all managed using generic ‘components’ of various ranks, which you can find in containers all over the place. It makes the swathes of options available to you much more attainable, and makes experimentation something that’s fun to fiddle around with, rather than an exercise in frustration.</p>
<p>The game also places a degree of focus on stealth, a sentence that might fill you with dread, but luckily Cyberpunk manages to execute its stealth in a satisfying way. Yes, enemies are a bit unobservant, but they have to be to make sneaking around even remotely fun, and the various netrunning skills you have at your disposal to map out the area, distract foes, and even make a swift recovery when spotted — should you act quickly enough of course — makes stealth almost a highlight of the combat in many ways.</p>
<p>It’s deeply rewarding to infiltrate a building, take out guards, send them running in the wrong direction, or lure them towards an explosive container and… well, you can imagine. It makes you feel genuinely powerful and sneaky, but get too big for your boots and you <em>will</em> be spotted. It’s a great balance, and you can almost always ignore it and run in with a katana regardless, should you prefer, just be prepared to deal with an awful lot of angry firepower.</p>

<p>Stealth takes an even more important role in the included DLC Phantom Liberty, a substantial extra slice of Night City goodness that is ingrained so effortlessly into the base game (and included in this Switch 2 release), you’d be forgiven for not noticing where one ends and another begins.</p>
<p>As opposed to your criminal dealings in the rest of Night City, Phantom Liberty and the new area of Dogtown have you running around as an agent of the government. Don’t worry, you’ll still be knee-deep in morally questionable actions throughout, but it’s a nice change of pace and setting compared to the base game.</p>
<p>You’ll team up with agents of the New United States of America, and some of them aren’t even completely jaded by being chewed up by their country and spat back out. Good for them. The people you work with are some of the best characters the game has to offer, not least Reed, played by the ever-wonderful Idris Elba, and trust me when I say that the bar set by the base game is <em>high</em>. Their dialogue, motivations - it’s all so relatable in such an alien and unfamiliar setting, and it had its hooks in me almost immediately.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 9 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156536/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of setting, one thing I didn’t fully expect my first time playing was that Dogtown could be worse than the other districts of Night City. This was a presumption promptly propelled out the window as the filth-soaked streets opened up to me. The whole area is run by Kurt Hansen, a man who claims he protects Dogtown and its residents whilst ruling with an iron fist, and his BARGHEST goons execute residents for sneezing without a permit. It’s a perfectly grim location for such a grim ‘society’, and I love it.</p>
<p>So, it’s a seriously meaty game; how does Nintendo’s new system handle such a demanding title? In short, it does an <em>excellent</em> job. There are two graphical modes: Quality, which targets 30fps and higher fidelity; and Performance, which ekes things out to an unusual (for a console) 40fps.</p>
<p>They’re both available in handheld no matter what, but Performance only works in docked mode if you have a 120hz TV or monitor, as 40 is not a factor of 60. Trust us, we worked it out on a calculator and everything, 40fps on a 60hz screen would cause some <em>wild</em> frame time inconsistencies, and would look awful.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Review - Screenshot 10 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156540/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both modes are a delight, and for the most part I stuck with Quality as I was playing docked and don’t have a whizzo 120hz TV. I originally played with motion blur enabled, but after getting used to it switched off, I can’t ever go back. It takes the edge off the low frame rate at first, but the game is <em>substantially</em> crisper and better looking without it.</p>
<p>Where things really shined, though, was handheld mode; when docked I could forget I was playing on a portable device, but holding the game in my hands looking as good as it does, and at 40fps on the Switch 2’s excellent VRR display, was something utterly magical, and bizarre. Couple this with cross-progression and you have the <em>ultimate</em> way to play Cyberpunk on the go, even if you're not new to the game.</p>
<p>There are moments when the game stutters, mainly loading new areas when driving about, and a few little hitches in various areas of Dogtown, but overall? The performance genuinely delighted me. I did notice a few graphical anomalies where the geometry seemed to go bananas (again, mostly in Dogtown), but they never really impacted my time more than, ‘Oh, that’s odd, can I make it happen again?’ Truly, this is the poster child for what ports can look like on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is a remarkable launch-day port for Nintendo's new console. Its deep, diverse, and tangible world is fully realised with impressive performance for such a low-powered device. If you've not taken your first steps into Night City already, or you're a long-time player with a portable-play itch that needs scratching, you're in for a serious treat, choom.</p></section>
