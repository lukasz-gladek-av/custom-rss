            <p>The second Mortal Kombat movie isn't even out yet, but Warner Bros. is reportedly "so excited" and "so convinced there's a giant fanbase waiting for it", writer and executive producer Jeremy Slater has already been hired to pen a third film.</p>
<p>Slater confirmed the news himself at a panel at New York Comic-Con. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/mortal-kombat-iii-jeremy-slater-writing-new-line-1236582473/">Deadline</a> has also confirmed New Line is "already gearing up" to expand the franchise.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie was set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">hit cinemas on October 24th</a>, but it has now been delayed by several months to May 15th, 2026. Test screenings have reportedly been "strong", but a busy October schedule is likely behind the decision to push back the release date to a more favourable mid-year position.</p>
<p>A follow-up to 2021's live-action Mortal Kombat movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">announced back in January 2021</a>, with Slater - head writer on Disney+'s Moon Knight series - confirmed to be handling the script. Simon McQuoid remains on directing duties after helming the first movie. To date, New Line's three Mortal Kombat-flavoured movies have generated $257.8m (£190.9m) collectively, with its Red Band trailer – embedded above – racking up a record-breaking 106.8m views in just 24 hours.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new fighter for Tekken 8 Season 2, and that is Madagascan Miary Zo who will be coming to the roster this December. To be more precise, December 2nd for those with early access and available for everyone else on December 5th. Miary Zo has a bit of an advantage, as she has the powers of the fighting god, Ogre, who was killed by Jin. You can check out a five minute gameplay reveal of Miary Zo reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 — Miary Zo Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7y2eDbqONc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the gameplay trailer, you can see Miary Zo uses martial arts like capoeira and involves parkour too. In addition, Miary Zo has the ability to summon a staff to help pull off additional moves as well as use that power to use moves based upon the animals she has studied through her life to learn moves from.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tekken 8 review, Nick said, <em>“Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as Street Fighter 6, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time.”</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-jackery-power-station-can-save-you-during-winter-outages-and-its-selling-for-pennies-2000634478</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-jackery-power-station-can-save-you-during-winter-outages-and-it%E2%80%99s-selling-for-pennies.1323019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms have a nasty habit of knocking out power right when you need it most. Your heating system goes silent, the fridge starts warming up and suddenly you’re digging through drawers for flashlights while your phone battery ticks down to single digits. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> exists to keep your essentials running when the grid fails, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">and it’s currently sitting at an all-time low of $429, slashed from $799</a>. It’s Amazon’s number one best-seller in portable power stations, with over 3,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power in a Package You Can Actually Carry</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 has 1,070Wh storage<strong> with a 1,500W continuous and 3,000W surge output</strong>. Those specs translate to real capability during cold winter power shortages: you can heat a room with a space heater, power your fridge to prevent food spoilage, charge several devices at a time and have lights throughout a house.</p>
<p>The pure sine wave AC output translates to sensitive equipment like laptops, medical equipment and modern appliances receiving clean power with no voltage spikes that will destroy equipment. You can <strong>power up to seven devices at a time with three AC outlets, two 100W PD fast-charging capability USB C ports, a single USB A port, and a DC car port</strong>.</p>



<p>The one-hour charging capability is game-changing and addresses the biggest weakness of traditional power stations: If you hear a winter storm warning and realize your backup power is sitting at 20%, you can fully charge the Explorer 1000 in just 60 minutes using the emergency charging mode activated through the Jackery app. Most competing units need 5-8 hours to reach full capacity which means you’re often caught unprepared. The default charging mode takes 1.7 hours which balances speed with battery longevity but having that emergency option provides real peace of mind when severe weather is approaching fast.</p>



<p>The LiFePO4 chemistry makes this unit distinct from more affordable lithium-ion competitors: The LFP batteries support in excess of 4,000 charge cycles with 70% or higher retained original capacity, which translates to a period exceeding a decade in continuous reliability. Common lithium-ion batteries significantly lose their integrity following 500-800 cycles.</p>
<p>Weighing a mere 23.8 pounds, the Jackery Explorer 1000 is incredibly portable for its capability. The collapsible handle makes moving a breeze from your garage to your living room during a power outage, or your trunk to a backcountry camping trail away from the power grid. <strong>Compare that to gasoline generators that weigh 50-80 pounds with storage for gasoline and maintenance</strong>, and that put fumes and noise throughout your home. The Jackery is silent as a whisper, zero emissions, and can be safely moved indoors where a gasoline generator would be lethal.</p>
<p>At $429 down from $799, you are receiving the portable power station that thousands rely on to power their homes in the winter months when power reliability is most critical. Make sure you don’t miss that opportunity before it runs out of stock.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-128gb-wifi-ipad-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-hit-a-record-low-while-apple-keeps-it-full-price-2000634474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-128gb-wifi-ipad-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-hit-a-record-low-while-apple-keeps-it-full-price.1323016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something about owning an iPad that feels like stepping into the Apple ecosystem the right way. It’s the device that bridges the gap between your phone and a full laptop and it’s perfect for taking notes in class, watching Netflix in bed or getting actual work done without lugging around a heavy machine. The problem has always been the price tag that comes with that Apple polish.</p>
<p>Right now, though, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon has slashed the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi option down to $279 from $349</a>, and this is a very rare opportunity. Apple doesn’t love discounts and you won’t find this price on their official website where it’s still sitting at full retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A More Balanced Power and Portability</h2>
<p>A16 chip on this iPad is the same processor that was used to power the iPhone 14 Pro so you have f<strong>lagship power in a tablet form</strong>. The processor handles intensive processes like Lightroom photo editing, iMovie video editing or multitasking with dozens of apps without skipping a beat or lagging behind. 6<strong>-core CPU and 5-core GPU deliver seamless power across everything</strong> from casual web surfing to CPU-intensive creative work.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display offers a 2388 x 1668-pixel resolution</strong> or 264 pixels per inch. Text is clear and readable, colors spring to life with precision and the True Tone technology dynamically adjusts the white point to complement your environment lighting. That means the screen appears natural under direct sunlight, soft interior lighting or the bluish tint of night. The full P3 wide color gamut is also incorporated into this display, so photos and videos are shown their full complement of colors instead of the squeezed palette found on lower-end tablets.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you <strong>secure and one-touch access to your iPad</strong>. A press of your finger and you’re in, no typing passwords or remembering complex passwords required. And yes, even for making App Store purchases and confirming payment methods, and offers a sense of security that feels convenient.</p>
<p>The 12MP rear and 12MP ultra-wide-angle front camera are found on the landscape edge of the device: That placement of the front camera is smarter than that might sound because if you are holding the iPad in landscape to Zoom or FaceTime, the camera is centered above the display rather than awkwardly positioned off to the side. The Center Stage feature uses machine learning to zoom and pan automatically during Zoom or FaceTime calls, and keeps you in the picture as you move around.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 capabilities translate to faster wireless throughput and higher throughput in busy network scenarios such as college campuses or busy coffee shops where dozens of devices are competing with each other for bandwidth. Greater efficiency translates to greater battery life with ratings by Apple at a full day of use. In the real world, that t<strong>ranslates to up to 10 hours of video playback</strong> or web surfing per recharge cycle.</p>
<p>At $279, we are getting the iPad experience at a price that at long last makes sense, and with Apple’s typical reluctance to depreciate their merchandise, this deal will not last long.</p>

              <p>You know that feeling when you walk past an Apple Store and imagine what it would be like to own one of those sleek MacBooks but then you remember your budget and keep walking? That mental barrier just got a lot easier to cross: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">brand-new 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip and 256GB storage is currently $799 on Amazon, down from $999</a>. We’ve n<strong>ever seen a MacBook this new drop this low</strong> and even older models never hit prices like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This MacBook Air Is a Game Changer for Average Users</h2>
<p>The 2025 MacBook Air answers a question that has been plaguing laptop shoppers for years: how do you achieve a machine that is powerful enough to do actual work, thin enough to take everywhere with you and runs cool enough that sitting on your lap won’t make you feel as though you are holding a space heater? The M4 chip does them all with ease. <strong>Built on a 3-nanometer process</strong>, this chip packs serious power.</p>
<p>The<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen puts a 2560×1664-pixel</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> at your fingertips, translating to very clear text and rich color. The screen is able to reproduce more than a billion colors and 500 nits brightness so you can really see what you are doing even next to a sunny window. The thin-bezel design uses the minimum amount of physical space to achieve maximum screen area without bulking up the laptop itself.</p>



<p>Apple has <strong>boosted the base level RAM to 16GB of unified memory</strong> for this refresh that is a notable increase from the 8GB that previous base levels shipped with. Unified memory is not the same as regular RAM as the CPU and GPU share the same pool of resources and allows for faster access to data and easier multitasking. In everyday experience, that translates to the ability to edit photos in Adobe Lightroom while keeping open Spotify, Slack, and Safari with dozens of tabs without the stuttering that is otherwise a given. The<strong> 256GB SSD is quick storage for your most critical files and apps</strong>.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera is a nice touch that alters the experience of video calls: Machine learning powers Center Stage to zoom and pan dynamically and keeps you in-frame no matter where you move. If you are the type that gestures with their hands or moves back and forth in their seat during long Zoom calls, this camera moves with a silky-smooth flow that keeps you in-frame at all times.</p>
<p>At $799, you are getting the latest technology from Apple at a price point that makes the MacBook Air affordable for anyone that was priced out of the world of Apple up until this point.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-sentence-game-journalists-good-at/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-sentence-is-the-first-game-that-journalists-are-guaranteed-to-be-good-at.1322992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that video game journalists aren’t good at games, right? It’s as true as the sun rising in the morning or the knowledge that it was <strong>lag </strong>that led to you losing your match, and not your abilities (or lack of). That’s why it’s exciting that a game is coming out that journalists <strong>must </strong>be good at – <strong>Final Sentence</strong>.</p>



<p>In Final Sentence, up to 100 players face off in a battle royale like no other. It features typewriters, revolvers loaded with a single bullet, and a warehouse full of bodies… Except for one person, that is. As you advance through the rounds, you have to type as though your life depends on it (which it does), and a single typo could mean a bullet to the head.</p>



<h2 id="h-in-final-sentence-a-single-tpyo-could-mean-death">In Final Sentence, a Single Tpyo Could Mean Death</h2>



<p>Final Sentence is slated to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on Steam</a> in Q4 2025, but until now, no concrete release date has been lined up for the title. Several months ago, the game’s solo developer, operating under the name Button Mash, revealed Final Sentence, explaining why the idea of the game surfaced in the first place:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am notoriously bad at typing myself, so I searched for the entertaining ways to improve. That’s when the idea of Final Sentence was born.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Final Sentence, players wake up in a warehouse full of people, all sitting at desks topped with a typewriter from days gone by. There’s a clock that ticks down seconds, and a masked man standing at every desk with a revolver. In that revolver sits a single bullet, and each mistake could mean <strong>death</strong>.</p>



<p>As you type, the other 99 (<em>up to</em>) do the same thing, and shots echo out around the room as a fatal mistake brings them to a grisly end.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a Russian Roulette of sorts, and it could be your first mistake or your sixth mistake that sends you to an early grave.</p>



<p>What’s bizarre is that the prompts you need to type in Final Sentence appear to reference pop culture classics and movies, with lines such as ‘Press F to pay respects’ and ‘Hide yo kids, hide yo wife’ being prompts.</p>



<p>Button Mash has explained that Final Sentence uses a ranking system that evaluates your performance and lets you know where to improve, so this is one battle royale title that has real-world, practical applications.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Final Sentence. Battle Royale Typing Game. Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2mclKfAWUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It also runs on an utter potato, which is great news for PC gamers without the best equipment.</p>



<p>Games journalists can finally enjoy a title that they’re good at, without worrying about pretending that they like games just to appease the masses.</p>



<p>Let me know if Final Sentence looks like your kind of game over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Age of Empires Games Are Seemingly Powered by Unreal Engine 5]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-age-of-empires-games-seemingly-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-age-of-empires-games-are-seemingly-powered-by-unreal-engine-5.1322983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1887907/Principal-Unreal-Engineer%2C-Gameplay---World's-Edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing posted this week</a>, a new Age of Empires game is in development at World's Edge. This, by itself, is no big surprise, since Microsoft's historic real-time strategy franchise has enjoyed a quiet renaissance in the last few years. Between 2018 and 2024, all previous installments have received their own Definitive Editions and/or remasters, of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> is just the latest. Most of them, especially Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, are still getting new DLC, too.</p>



<p>However, unless they're going for a full-fledged remake of an existing game that was already remastered, chances are this is going to be a brand new game. The biggest surprise from that job listing, though, is that it reveals that the title will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology.</p>



<p><em>At Xbox Game Studios, we are hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires, our beloved RTS (Real Time Strategy) franchise. We are a passionate group responsible for this amazing franchise and are expanding our team looking for a wonderful colleague that will be responsible for planning and building our future tech stack. We are looking for a Principal Unreal Engineer with background in all aspects of Unreal Engine game development and experience leading external resources.</em></p>



<p>Internet sleuths have also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o3ylx1/more_evidence_about_worlds_edge_studio_behind_age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> the LinkedIn page of World's Edge Principal Build Lead Engineer, which tells us that the team has been developing a triple-A pipeline support for 'unannounced titles using Unreal Engine 5', plural. This particular developer has been with World's Edge since December 2023.</p>



<p>The first candidate is, of course, Age of Empires V. The fourth mainline installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did well enough</a>, receiving several awards for the best strategy game released in 2021. Its fourth expansion, Dynasties of the East, will release on November 4 (the same date as <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's debut on PlayStation 5</a>), adding Golden Horde, Macedonian Dynasty, Sengoku Daimyo, and Tughlaq Dynasty as well as a roguelite single player mode.</p>



<p>Age of Empires IV was developed by Relic Entertainment. As far as we know, World's Edge is not big enough to make a new installment on its own, so it'll be interesting to see if they partner with Relic once again. As a reminder, the Vancouver-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became independent from SEGA in March 2024</a>.</p>

<p>Ready? Set? NSO!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="e2323cab41215"><a title="Fatal Fury Special - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2323cab41215/fatal-fury-special-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back, back, back with another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-teleroboxer-virtual-boy">Last time</a>, it was the Virtual Boy in the spotlight, as we matched up a duo of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a>. It was two very different designs and they pulled in very different results, but the North American variant took the dub with 69% of the vote, leaving the Japanese box with 31%.</p>
<p>We're sticking with a one-on-one duel this week, jumping ahead to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">recently announced NSO newbie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a>. Originally released on the SNES in 1994 ('95 in North America), this fighter bundled characters from the series' two previous games into one 'everyone is here' package — okay, it obviously wasn't <em>everyone</em>...</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one (excluding the NA variant's classic black borders, obviously) so we've got just two covers to choose between this time. Ready? Vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:192341 @ 1760277741 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="8e1639b5408e2"><a title="Fatal Fury Special - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8e1639b5408e2/fatal-fury-special-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2705-fatal-fury-special">Takara / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's happened to classic hand-drawn covers, eh? This design pits six fighters against each other, spinning off into three pairs. It's awash with close combat poses, rippling muscles and more ripped sleeves than we ever thought possible — heck, only Tung Fu Rue has his shoulders covered, but that's only because his spectral form has the full gun show on display.</p>
<p>Throw in some lightning in the background and an ablaze series logo for good measure, and you've got a pretty badass design.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="731916874a016"><a title="Fatal Fury Special - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/731916874a016/fatal-fury-special-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2705-fatal-fury-special">Takara / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this is far more... cinematic. We've gotten too used to Hollywood's floating-head poster designs these days, but look at how hard this one slaps! We get to see <em>every</em> character, all featured in a much more goofy pose, while flames burst out from behind them.</p>
<p>Do we wish that Terry Bogard and Joe Higashi's eyes were burrowing into our souls's <em>slightly</em> less? Of course we do. But there's no denying that it's cool.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 3, stylized as Mortal Kombat III, is now greenlit at Warner Bros and New Line, according to the screenwriter.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat film series is rather new, starting in 2021. The newest entry, Mortal Kombat II, is currently in post-production, having been delayed to May 15th, 2026. However, it seems the reception from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-mortal-kombat-2-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its huge red-band trailer</a> was enough to get another entry going before the sequel hits theaters.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-3-confirmed-by-screenwriter-at-comic-con">Mortal Kombat 3 Confirmed by Screenwriter at Comic-Con</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Jeremy Slater, screenwriter for Mortal Kombat II, announced at New York Comic-Con that Mortal Kombat 3 is officially in the works. Furthermore, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/mortal-kombat-iii-jeremy-slater-writing-new-line-1236582473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive news from Deadline</a> confirms that New Line and Warner Bros will return to distribute and produce the film. As the sequel isn’t out, no story details or casting have been confirmed. Even more so, there is no release date for the film, as it’s in the writing stages. </p>



<p>At the Comic-Con panel, Jeremy Slater stood with the cast and crew of Mortal Kombat II, like Karl Urban and Tati Gabrielle. As he was telling the audience about Mortal Kombat II, he revealed the third entry’s existence. He says,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our friends at New Line and Warner Bros. are so happy with this movie,” Slater remarks. “They are so excited. They are so convinced that there is a giant fanbase waiting for it that they have already hired me to start writing the next installment of Mortal Kombat.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a pretty good sign when Mortal Kombat III is greenlit before Mortal Kombat II is even out. While the delay from October 2025 to May 2026 is a big leap, it seems Warner Bros. is happy with the film enough to do another. The original Mortal Kombat film did quite well at the box office, so perhaps we can see the series get another lease on life in film.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fire-tv-soundbar-is-selling-for-pennies-post-prime-day-now-5x-less-than-sony-or-bose-rivals-2000634427</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fire-tv-soundbar-is-selling-for-pennies-post-prime-day-now-5x-less-than-sony-or-bose-rivals.1322878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all been there. You’re watching an action-packed movie scene and you can barely hear the dialogue over the explosions, or worse, the tinny speakers on your flat-screen TV make everything sound like it’s coming from inside a cereal box. Modern TVs might have stunning picture quality but their built-in audio is almost universally disappointing because manufacturers prioritize slim designs over decent speakers.</p>
<p>A soundbar transforms this experience completely and makes dialogue crystal clear and adding depth that pulls you into whatever you’re watching. Sure, there are premium models costing $2,000 or more but you don’t need to drain your wallet for a solid upgrade: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4711/">Amazon’s Fire TV Soundbar has dropped to just $89 on Amazon, down from its regular $119 price</a>. This is an all-time low that makes upgrading your audio setup a no-brainer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4711/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Fire TV Soundbar answers the key questions in a straightforward fashion: It has <strong>two speakers in a compact 24-inch form that sits comfortably under the majority of televisions</strong> and does not try to engulf your media center. It stands a svelte 2.5 inches tall so it will not get in the way of your TV display or remote control sensor, a scenario many larger units precipitate. Those two speakers give you deeper sound throughout the range, which means you’ll get to hear real bass note rumble instead of mid-range confusion. Dialogue comes out clearer as vocal sounds are separated from background sounds.</p>
<h2>Avoid the Luxury Price Tag</h2>
<p>What makes this soundbar stand out in its class is that it comes <strong>with DTS Virtual:X and Dolby Audio processing</strong>. These are not marketing terms. DTS Virtual:X generates a three-dimensional sound stage that mimics surround sound but doesn’t need separate speakers placed around your room. It reads the audio signal and applies psychoacoustic properties to make you believe you are hearing sound above and to the side of you, not just from the front. It makes explosions in action films seem more immersive and wildlife documentaries seem more real. Dolby Audio does something extra by retaining more information in the soundtrack, so you don’t lose faint sound effects like footsteps or rustling leaves in the background.</p>



<p>Setup couldn’t be easier which is a good thing if you’re not computer-oriented or simply don’t want to spend an afternoon wading through instruction manuals. The bundle comes complete with an HDMI cable that plugs directly in to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC plug. The “ARC” refers to the Audio Return Channel which has your TV transmitting audio back to the soundbar via the same cable. This gets rid of sync issues when dialogue isn’t properly aligned to lip movement, a defect that afflicts some wireless audio systems. Once you plug it in, the audio signals directly through the soundbar and since it’s Fire TV Ready, you can control both your TV and soundbar volume from a single remote.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth connection makes it possible to extend the application of soundbar beyond TV viewing: You <strong>can connect your phone or tablet wirelessly to play music or books over the soundbar speaker</strong>. With room filling sound, you have a good solution for background dinner party music or individual listening. The range of connection generally varies around 30 fee, and you have flexibility to have the device handy but are not bound by cables.</p>
<p>This soundbar <strong>supports both smart TVs and non-smart TVs</strong> hooked up to streaming devices so it’ll work for almost any existing setup.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-controllers-are-now-selling-for-pennies-microsoft-is-offloading-prime-day-leftovers-2000634423</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-controllers-are-now-selling-for-pennies-microsoft-is-offloading-prime-day-leftovers.1322863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming with friends is only fun when everyone has a controller in hand: There’s nothing worse than wanting to jump into a co-op session or host a game night only to realize you’re one controller short. That’s where having an extra Xbox controller becomes essential and right now, Microsoft is practically giving them away: The 2025 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Carbon Black edition (and many more colors) has dropped to just $49 on Amazon, down from its usual $64 price tag</a>. This is a record low that didn’t even happen during Prime Day, which tells you Microsoft is seriously clearing inventory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 2025 model keeps everything gamers loved about previous versions while refining the experience: The Carbon Black finish looks sleek without showing fingerprints as easily as glossy controllers, and the ergonomic design ensures your hands won’t cramp during those marathon gaming sessions. The textured grip on the back and triggers provides better control during intense moments.</p>
<h2>Cross-Platform Liberty that Actually Functions</h2>
<p>This single controller does it all <strong>seamlessly between Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Windows PCs, Android smartphones and tablets, iOS smartphones and tablets, FireTV Sticks, Smart TVs, and yes, VR headsets too</strong>. By being cross-platform, you’re not bound to just a single ecosystem. Need to continue your game session on your laptop when someone prefers to use the TV? Just sync the controller via Bluetooth (which does it in a few seconds) and you’re good to continue. With a <strong>wireless range of up to 30 feet</strong>, you have full liberty to sit anywhere comfortably in your front room and never have to worry about losing a signal.</p>



<p>Special mention must go to the battery life since this directly affects how you play games: It <strong>uses two AA batteries and provides you with about 40 hours of play time before replacement</strong> which translates to just over two months of moderate usage. It lasts longer than many rechargeable controllers that lose capacity after a year. You can, of course, use rechargeable AA batteries if you are that kind, and that provides you flexibility depending on how you have things set up. When you use it with Xbox consoles, the wireless uses the <strong>proprietary Xbox protocol and that provides you lower latency than ordinary Bluetooth</strong>. It does make a huge difference if you are playing competitive games and reactions are measured in a few milliseconds.</p>



<p>The button arrangement conforms to the classic Xbox design that millions of players already intuitively know: The hybrid direction pad handles sweeping motion and exact eight-way input equally well and is suitable for both fighting games and platform games. Analog sticks have enhanced sensors that have fewer dead zones, so your character reacts to the softest movement.</p>
<p>For just $49 down from $64, you’re getting a controller that has a 4.6-star rating among over 20,000 reviewers and currently tops the bestseller chart among Xbox Series X and S controllers. This all-time low makes it the best time to acquire another controller in your arsenal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forgotten Seas has a launched into version 1.0]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pangea Game Studios has set sail upon the good ship Forgotten Seas, which has launched into version 1.0 today. Forgotten Seas is a survival game where you sail in the Bermuda Void where the sea is endless and land can be scarce. The game has been in early access since June 2024, and throughout the development team has been regularly updating it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forgotten Seas | 1.0 Launch Trailer | indie.io" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nju463ZFImA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>During Forgotten Seas early access some of the main additions that were introduced included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crew recruitment, township building, and management systems<wbr></li>
<li>Expanded base-building to create safe havens<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fully developed map system<wbr></li>
<li>Treasure hunting, collection, and display mechanics<wbr></li>
<li>New adventures across the high seas<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Sailing skill progression system<wbr></li>
<li>More naval combat encounters and on-foot battles<wbr></li>
<li>Additional ships to master and command<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Commodity trading and delivery missions<wbr></li>
<li>More layered gameplay loops to discover</li>
</ul>
<p>Forgotten Seas has a bit of a unique angle to it in that you craft ships in a bottle and then throw them out to sea. This ship in a bottle then spawns into a full size ship that can be sailed upon the seas. And when you are on land, you can store the ship back in the bottle so you don’t lose it. You can create a fleet of ships too, so there is a choice of what one to take out to sea. That choice has expanded with the launch of version 1.0, with Pangea Game Studios adding the 200-foot dreadnaught The Justicar, though you have to prove yourself to earn it since this ship is resistant to all damage types. There is a new encounter with the enemy Gravy Bones while searching for the Temporal Hourglass. If you do not fancy sailing you can set up multiple businesses on land and manage those instead, including bars and farms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major update</a> to their Project Amethyst collaboration (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally unveiled in December 2024</a>) this past week in a video featuring PlayStation Lead Architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP and GM of the Computing and Graphics Group Jack Huynh. The duo presented three major new features, Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression, which will be coming to future AMD GPUs and consoles like Sony's PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The video was only about nine minutes long, though, and inevitably left viewers with plenty of questions. Thankfully, the folks from Digital Foundry got a few answers from Mark Cerny via an email Q&amp;A and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7dK_X5tnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted them in their latest video</a>, where they also discussed the aforementioned features.</p>



<p>Firstly, when asked about the change in Sony's hardware and software strategy from the PlayStation 5 Pro to the next PlayStation console, Mark Cerny said Project Amethyst would bring about a monumental shift:</p>



<p><em>We've shifted our focus substantially. In the past, we were largely creating custom technologies just for PlayStation platforms. But now with Project Amethyst, we're placing substantially more of a focus on co-engineering and co-development with AMD on their roadmap hardware and libraries. That change will have a very large impact, because when developers can create their technology with the understanding that it will work across multiple platforms such as desktops, laptops, consoles, etc., there will be much larger pickup of new features. So I believe we'll see outsized impact from the technologies announced this past week!</em></p>



<p>Having said that, the PlayStation Lead Architect also admitted that any sort of quantification of the benefits brought by technologies like Universal Compression and Radiance Cores will have to wait until game developers actually implement them in their engines (when it comes to the former) or have access to the new hardware (when it comes to the latter).</p>



<p><em>With these technologies, we know that great stuff is coming but it’s difficult (or impossible) to quantify. For Universal Compression, I have high hopes for synergies with ML, for example, FSR and PSSR are recurrent neural networks that write feature maps to system memory - how well will those feature maps compress? Radiance Cores are similar, they are obviously a great way to do the processing, but I suspect we'Il need to get prototypes into the hands of game developers to understand the degree to which they will be able to “level up their engines.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, in the video announcement, Mark Cerny had stressed that all these features 'only exist in simulation right now', meaning it will take time before developers get to play with them.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Lead Architect also shared a couple more interesting tidbits in the email exchange with Digital Foundry. First, he agreed that Universal Compression is particularly important because it's becoming increasingly complex to achieve significant memory bandwidth increases from generation to generation. Secondly, he confirmed that Sony (and, by extension, AMD) is particularly interested in boosting machine learning and ray tracing for their next hardware compared to regular rasterization, which will get some improvements 'where possible' but is clearly not the focus anymore.</p>



<p>This ties nicely with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">PlayStation 6 specs rumor</a> that mentioned 'only' a 2.5x to 3x rasterization improvement from the PlayStation 5, whereas ray tracing would be 6x to 12x faster in the new console (which, according to leaker Kepler, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony plans to launch in 2027</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever gotten into an argument with a friend over who is the greatest of all time between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then we suggest taking a few minutes to check out the popular Roblox title Neo Tennis. As the name suggests, Neo Tennis is a sports game where players are pitched against each other in 1v1 or 2v2 tennis matches. There are global as well as seasonal ranking systems in the game, adding further reason for players to grind out Neo Tennis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With special in-game abilities and custom rackets to acquire, the competition level can be quite high, which is why some Neo Tennis codes could prove to be useful. Although cosmetics and in-game currency can be highly sought-after items from these Neo Tennis codes, getting a unique racket is an experience on its own. To get free rewards in this game using Neo Tennis codes, continue reading on.</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-neo-tennis-codes">Expired Neo Tennis Codes</h2>



<div><p>As of the writing of this article, there are no Neo Tennis codes that have expired. Although the lack of codes could be a cause for concern among aspiring players, considering that the game came out relatively recently, they don’t need to be overly worried. Moreover, with just how popular the game has become recently, new Neo Tennis codes are surely on the horizon, and players are urged to wait patiently for the next drop.</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend that all active players of the game keep this page bookmarked, as we update this article with the latest codes as soon as the developers release them. Be it through their Discord server or through the socials, rest assured that our page will be updated soon after the codes come out.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-neo-tennis-codes">How to redeem Neo Tennis Codes</h2>



<p>Redeeming codes in Neo Tennis is a fairly simple process, with no major steps needing to be completed before players can get their hands on the rewards on offer. Although many Roblox games nowadays impose requirements on players before giving them the ability to redeem codes, Neo Tennis has done no such thing. Redeeming Neo Tennis codes is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. Here’s a step-by-step guide for beginners:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Neo Tennis</li>



<li>Move the cursor into the codes area and hold the ‘E’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box that pops up</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Check’ button to receive your rewards</li>
</ul>

		<p>Enjoy Studio has announced that it will be releasing the Everwind demo slightly earlier than planned, with those interested in the game able to try it out from tomorrow, October 12th. The demo will launch at 5pm BST. The developers had originally planned to release the demo on October 13th, but brought it forward by a day due to the support they have received from people following the game. This is a limited time demo, and will only be available until October 20th.</p>
