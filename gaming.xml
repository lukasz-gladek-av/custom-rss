As a whole, the post is meant to make players aware of how Sony plans to celebrate PlayStation’s 30th Anniversary, detailing upcoming offerings such as a free trial period of Gran Turismo 7 and digital game soundtracks. It’s a message that ends teasing that fans should “be on the lookout for more announcements in the near future,” but the biggest reveal starts at the top of the page. </p><p>If you take a close look between the PlayStation logo and the 30 in the image below, you’ll see what many fans have picked up on: a foreign PS5 design that features three stripes on its side.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/screenshot-2024-09-05-150456-1725567211175.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sony seemingly teases the design of the PS5 Pro in this PlayStation 30th Anniversary image.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Sony has released a number of PS5 plates since the console was first released in 2020. Although players have been able to pick up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-ps5-console-covers-announced">various cover colors</a> and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-internet-weighs-in-on-the-ps5-redesign-and-plenty-think-it-looks-no-different-than-before"><u>single-striped PS5 Slim</u></a>, a PS5 with three breaks in its plates has never been officially revealed. Considering the likely tease accompanies the announcement that Sony’s 30th anniversary plans are on the horizon, we may not have to wait that much longer to see what could be an official announcement for what many are already calling the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Although Sony hasn’t gone as far as to reveal or name its long-awaited PS5 upgrade, fans have anticipated an announcement for months. Now nearly four years removed from the launch of the fifth PlayStation console, it’s high time for a mid-gen refresh that gives gamers more tools to play their favorite titles. There’s also the fact that, last week, reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>leaker billbil-kun shared</u></a> what they said was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-leak-reveals-alleged-name-and-design-of-the-console"><u>the design of the PS5 Pro</u></a>, publishing a picture that looks remarkably similar to what we’re seeing today. The time is right and the rumors are swirling more than ever, but until Sony confirms the news itself, it’s best to keep expectations for the PS5 Pro low for now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another look at the PS5 Pro design <a href="https://t.co/WLI6Vy9hLH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WLI6Vy9hLH</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1831776473839247819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Sony is said to be aiming to release a new console sometime during this year’s holiday season, with an official announcement possibly happening ahead of Tokyo Game Show.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguards-devs-reveal-new-info-about-each-of-the-companions-and-solas-and-varric-too.973590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-devs-reveal-new-info-about-each-of-the-companions-and-solas-and-varric-too<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Friendships, romantic relationships, and everything in between have always been an integral part of not just the Dragon Age series, but of BioWare in general. From Mass Effect’s Garrus Vakarian to Dragon Age’s Varric Tethras, the characters – and how they get along with the player – are inseparable from titles from the studio.</p><p>But, perhaps more than any other BioWare game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is leaning in <em>heavily </em>on this idea, as it’s already easy to see from the marketing material. For one, the name changed from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf back in June, with BioWare general manager Gary McKay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>telling us at the time</u></a> that it was out of a desire to shift the focus to a “really deep and compelling group of companions.” That would be followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>a first official trailer at Summer Game Fest</u></a> that put the focus squarely on seven new companions that will be tagging along with the player character, Rook, in The Veilguard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With all that in mind, it’s little surprise to hear game director Corinne Busche talk about how these companions aren’t <em>just</em> central to the story of The Veilguard, but the gameplay and combat as well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"You're going to develop trust, understanding. That doesn't mean you're always going to agree.”</p></div><p>“Building a relationship with companions has always been a staple of Dragon Age, but this time around, that relationship translates into how well you work together as a team,” Busche tells IGN. “It is how you're actually going to level up your companions, by getting to know them better. That's how you're going to unlock skill points. So when you look at all of the various abilities the companions have, there's inherent combos and synergies and roles that they'll have on the battlefield.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>She uses the example of Neve, the mysterious detective mage who has a wildly useful special ability to slow time in combat. “But if I really get the opportunity to know her,” Busche explains, “whether it's platonic or romantic, I'm going to help be able to shape her skills and augment those abilities that work really well with my own personal build, so our sense of teamwork really deepens.”</p><p>During our time with the game, IGN got to see some of this in action; unsurprisingly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an approval/disapproval system, with pop-up text on the side of the screen indicating whether or not a companion liked what Rook just did or said. But something new in this Dragon Age: even just completing a quest with a companion in your party increases your “bond” with them, whether they agree with how you handled things or not. Your relationship, Busche says, isn’t necessarily about “how much they like you, but how well you get to know them.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1828492421639860624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“This is about a found family,” Busche tells us. “That is, they have the same goals, different complications in their life, but they're all giving everything they have to defend Thedas. You're going to get to know them really well. You're going to develop trust, understanding. That doesn't mean you're always going to agree.”</p><p>But, we’ll have plenty more to say about the game systems and combat later. With Busche, we had the opportunity to really dive into the seven companions at the center of The Veilguard and what they’re all about. Here’s what she had to say about each one:</p><h3><strong>Davrin</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Grey Warden</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ike Amadi</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>When we were thinking about Davrin, how we were going to develop him as a character, we had to think about, 'How is he going to show up on the battlefield?' And it was unique because he has this, I guess you could say, companion of his own, the griffon Assan. That makes him, as a companion, very unique, because Assan shows up on the battlefield. So we had to think about how that integrates into his abilities, where Davrin as a Grey Warden is capable on his own, but also, when does he call upon Assan and what does that look like? What happens if you're indoors?... And indeed, when you're doing some of Davrin's content, just seeing Assan gliding through the environments, you really get a sense that they care and they're protective about each other. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I absolutely love when you're journeying with Davrin, not only his aesthetic, how he carries himself as a Warden, but how he interacts with his fellow Wardens."</p></div><p>“…When we think about Davrin and his being the representative of the Grey Wardens within the team of The Veilguard, it was an opportunity for us to really go back to some of those roots that we know our fans, our players, deeply care about. Dragon Age: Origins, of course, was so Grey Warden-forward. We want to evoke those memories, those connections that our players have. And I absolutely love when you're journeying with Davrin, not only his aesthetic, how he carries himself as a Warden, but how he interacts with his fellow Wardens. The little wrinkle of, 'Hey, there actually are some griffons remaining in Thedas,' how he learns as a Warden to train and interact with these griffons that, to our knowledge, haven't existed for quite some time, it's a learning experience on a lost art of the Grey Wardens that is really unique to Davrin's character.”</p><h3><strong>Harding</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>None (scout)</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ali Hillis</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Missing (comic book)</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>To talk about Harding as a companion, I guess I'd have to go back to Inquisition. Of course, Harding showed up. She was your scout on the field. There was a light romance with her, and I think one of the things that the team didn't quite expect is how much Harding would catch on in Inquisition. Players fell in love with her, and we heard them. They wanted a deeper romance, they wanted more engagement with Harding. So for the team, I felt like it was kind of a no-brainer for us to bring back Harding, and we also wanted to reestablish that connection to the Inquisition in the world of Thedas, which occurred 10 years ago, the events of Inquisition.</p><p>“Harding serves as our proxy back to those events, and you get to learn about what's happened with the Inquisition since, so she presents some really lovely opportunities for us. I will say, personality-wise and her role on the battlefield, she is among my favorites. When you see her leap into the air, unleashing these devastating attacks with her bow and arrow, I just can't get enough of her.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Taash</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Lords of Fortune</p><p><strong>Voiced by: </strong>Jin Maley</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Taash, in the creation of their arc, is one of our more complex characters. It's a journey along their arc that is about introspection. 'Where do I belong in the world? What are my boundaries? What do I fight for? How do I become at peace with who I am?' So I love the juxtaposition, actually, between Taash's personal journey and this imposing literal dragon slayer, that sort of hard exterior and really gentle interior. It makes Taash a really special companion for me.”</p><p>(When asked which companion had the steamiest romance): “I'll just speak for me personally, but at the culmination of the romance arcs, I'd have to say Taash. When I got to that scene and saw the finished version of that cinematic, I was hollering. <em>Hollering</em>.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Emmrich</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>Mourn Watch</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Nick Boraine</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: The Flame Eternal (<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-inquisition/news/the-eternal-flame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>short story</u></a>)</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>The thing about Emmrich that is going to surprise our fans the most is his relationship with necromancy. I really love that we kind of turned the idea of a necromancer on its head here, where you think of them as these conjurers of evil, the certain malice when you hear the term 'necromancer,' but it couldn't be farther from the truth for Emmrich. There is a reverence about the dead. He has a unique relationship with death. You get to explore how he ended up in the Mourn Watch. Death has shaped this character in all aspects of his life, and we frequently refer to him as our gentleman necromancer. I think his proper, kind nature stems from that respect that he's learned about this cycle of life and death throughout his life. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Death has shaped this character in all aspects of his life, and we frequently refer to him as our gentleman necromancer."</p></div><p>“Manfred is like a son to Emmrich. He very much has an affinity for this wisp, this life force that he's given a second chance through this skeletal body, and in many ways, it's the story of a parent raising a child. Emmrich, he needs to teach Manfred and help him along to develop as a character of their own, things like learning new skills, how to assist The Veilguard. Some of our most charming moments are in dealing with Manfred, and I must say I absolutely love the interactions. They just have me rolling whenever Manfred steals the show.</p><p>“…In my last playthrough, I romanced Emmrich. What I also loved is as I'm synergizing with him as we're doing combos, just having him refer to me as ‘my dear’ on the battlefield. ‘Well done, my dear!’ It just fills me with joy every time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Lucanis</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Antivan Crows</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Zach Mendez</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Tevinter Nights (short story anthology)</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “The character that went through the most changes [throughout development] without a doubt was Lucanis. Lucanis is very complex. He's an assassin. He is very skilled in the art of death. The Antivan Crows, they pursue these contracts with a certain level of dispassion, but also, Lucanis is a romantic, and he's dealing with some internal struggles. He's been through a lot of trauma. He's relearning how to trust. And all of those elements come together with a richness, but it creates a lot of complexity in how we tell that story. So I'd say Lucanis is the first one that comes to my mind in terms of the thought that's gone into it, where we've had to make adjustments to really cover all facets of his character.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Neve</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>Shadow Dragons</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jessica Clark</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Trevinter Nights, The Missing</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>Neve is our confident noir detective. I love to bring her onto the battlefield because she's just so incredibly capable. She's our ice mage, so really big on controlling the battlefield, and that's actually a good metaphor to her arc. She wants to fight for change. She wants to fight for a better Minrathous, and she's going to use all the tools at her disposal to try and reshape Minrathous into a better place for all. She's very much a Shadow Dragon. This is among the mantra of the Shadow Dragons. They operate from the shadows, fighting for a better Minrathous. So as this accomplished ice mage, she's fierce. She's not going to shy away from any challenge, whether it's taking down darkspawn or dealing with the Magisterium in Minrathous.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3><strong>Bellara</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Veil Jumpers</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jee Young Han</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Oh, my dear, sweet Bellara. I relate to Bellara a lot. She is joyous. She's been through a lot, but she remains curious, optimistic. She's kind of a geek. She really likes her fiction. She fangirls over Neve a little bit. She's just so relatable, and I think that's what our players will find and fall in love with when they get to meet Bellara, is just how much you'll recognize some of those patterns and sensibilities that she holds, but don't let it fool you. She is also a Veil Jumper. She's very comfortable in elven ruins. I frequently bring her with me in my party. I like to play rogue. I like to play the Veil Jumper, or the Veil Ranger. Bellara's a fantastic companion to set up that spec with electric vulnerabilities, so I love her both on and off the battlefield.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/ign-first-varric-and-solas-illo-copy-1725563602830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Bonus round</strong>: Solas</h3><p><strong>Voiced by: </strong>Gareth David-Lloyd</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Masked Empire (novel), Tevinter Nights, Dark Fortress (comic series)</p><p>Okay okay, so Solas isn’t technically one of your core companions who will travel with you, but given his place in the Dragon Age story, we <em>still</em> had to ask about his relationship with Rook. Here’s what Busche had to say:</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Rook's relationship with Solas is a complicated one. Everyone has seen, at this point, the gameplay reveal and the opening moments of the game, so you'll know things got shaken up pretty radically for Solas already. He's trapped. He's basically communicating with you as an advisor, and I absolutely love that idea of, ‘He's your lifeline right now, but can you trust him?’ And those touch points with him, ‘Do I take his advice or not? Can he be trusted? Is he going to betray me?’ All the while giving you this information that you absolutely need in order to be successful.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"[Solas is] basically communicating with you as an advisor, and I absolutely love that idea of, ‘He's your lifeline right now, but can you trust him?’ "</p></div><p>“It creates an interesting stage for us, where, I think our fans will agree, Solas is very complicated. He firmly believes he's doing the right thing, and some of our fans will agree that he's trying to do the right thing. Others will not, and this creates a stage for you, the player, where you get to lean into those tendencies of your own as you're taking advice from Solas throughout parts of the game. I think those really interesting debates about, ‘Was he ever redeemable? Can he be trusted? Was he wrong all along?’ You're really going to be able to dive in deep on that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Bonus round #2</strong>: Varric</h3><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age Appearances: </strong>Dragon Age II, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Knight Errant (comic book), Tevinter Knights, The Missing</p><p>Varric, while a part of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and a series mainstay, isn’t part of your core companions either. <em>But</em>, as fans can see in the trailers, he’s still very much in The Veilguard, so we asked Dragon Age creative director John Epler about how he’s changed since we last saw him in Inquisition:</p><p><strong>Epler</strong>: “Since the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, he has spent the time, just briefly, obviously, [serving as] Viscount of Kirkwall. I mean, anybody who knows much about Varric knows how well a job where he sits around and tells people what to do is going to sit with him. He has been participating in the hunt for Solas. And I think for Varric in particular, that's a very difficult thing for him to do because Solas is his friend. Solas is somebody that he grew close to over the events of Inquisition. They adventure together, they work together.</p><p>“And now knowing who Solas really is, that eats at Varric. Because Varric always sees, Varric believes he can always make somebody do the right thing. Varric believes he is the most convincing, charismatic, because he cares about people. And he has this belief that as long as I get a chance to talk to Solas, I'm going to be able to turn him. But as he's seeing what Solas' ritual is doing to the world around him, as he experienced in the comics, Dragon Age: The Missing, that eats at him a little bit. That's challenging his world view of him as always being the best judge of people, being able to see that somebody is able to be redeemed. And he's starting to question a little bit, ‘am I right or am I being a fool by believing in Solas?’ ”</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31, 2024.</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <p>
A recently leaked image purportedly showing Sony's heavily discussed but still officially under-wraps PlayStation 5 Pro appears to have received corroboration from an unexpected source. A near-identical design has now been spotted in the background of Sony's newly unveiled official PlayStation 30th anniversary artwork.
</p>
<p>
Last week, prolific leaker bilbil-kun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-design-reportedly-leaks">shared details of Sony's still unannounced PS5 Pro</a>, alongside an illustration of its outer shell. While it mostly retained the PS5's familiar open-shirt design, it included one notable change: in place of the single diagonal stripe found on the body of the PlayStation Slim, the leaked PS5 Pro design featured three diagonal ridged lines.
</p>
<p>
Keep that in mind as we now hurtle forward in time to the present, and Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">recently announced PlayStation 30th anniversary celebrations</a>. Alongside details of its birthday activities - which are set to include the release of several digital soundtracks as well as a new range of toys - Sony shared new anniversary artwork featuring a grey cross, triangle, circle, and square made up of various PlayStation consoles and peripherals.

<p>
And there, right between the PlayStation logo and a big old number three, sits something that doesn't resemble a currently released PlayStation device, but which looks awfully familiar all the same: a large rectangular machine with three distinct diagonal ridges running along its side. So yes, this may well be our first official confirmation, albeit indirectly, of PS5 Pro's existence.
</p>

<p>
And if last week's design is accurate, it seems reasonable to assume other details shared by bilbil-kun (that PS5 Pro will be a digital-only model possibly with support for the PS5 disc drive add-on) are too. It was also claimed Sony would formally announce the console this month, so with official artwork seemingly now out in the wild, we could be on the cusp of a full reveal.

Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have been tracking the PS5 Pro's path to release since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-weekly-are-the-latest-switch-2-and-ps5-pro-leaks-actually-plausible">leaks first emerged last summer</a>. Since then, PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">technical specs</a> have appeared online, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">Digital Foundry analysis</a> dubbed the PS5 Pro "the most powerful console yet". April brought word Sony has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/which-games-will-get-sonys-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">prepping a "PS5 Pro Enhanced" label</a> for new and older patched games that will take advantage of its upcoming hardware, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">yet more technical details</a> leaked in May. Hopefully, all will be revealed soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-login-error-fix-incoming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The early access launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> has disappointingly been plagued with server issues for the always-online game, as Nacon and developer KT Racing… race to find fixes to get the game’s server capacity solidified for the full launch on 12th September.</p>
<p>The studio has issued <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4593196713075894202">a statement on Steam</a> explaining the issues and the steps being taken to remedy the situation:</p>


<blockquote><p>Since the official server launch today at 08:00 AM UTC, many players have encountered severe connection issues with the game, mainly with login, lobbies, and various online features. These issues applies to all platforms: PC (Steam), PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Our teams are working tirelessly to stabilize the servers so that everyone can enjoy the game as soon as possible. To give you more context on the current situation, we have tried multiple solutions to address these network issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our server team has actively investigated the root causes of connection failures.</li>
<li>We have implemented server optimizations to handle the high volume of players trying to access the game.</li>
<li>We have increased server capacity to reduce queues and connection failures.</li>
<li>Our quality assurance team has conducted thorough tests to ensure the stability of our fixes before deploying them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although each solution has helped partially, some of them have also introduced new technical challenges.</p>
<p>We are actively working to resolve all the network issues and thank you again for your patience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issues were already a factor before this public launch, blocking us from reviewing the game as maintenance affected all journalists’ ability to play the game on Tuesday and Wednesday, and a separate bug and issue blocked us specifically before then.</p>
<p>A queueing system is currently in place for the game, noting around 1,600 players waiting on PS5 tonight, which gradually ticks down, and then in our case led to getting kicked out to a more general ‘Login Error’ screen. SteamDB notes a peak player count on PC of 4,300 – this will simply be a total of players with the client open, so it’s not clear how many are actively able to play.</p>
<p>All of this is a pretty serious issue, and one that immediately has fans of the series and early buyers either <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tdu3/">turning around and requesting refunds, or banging the drum over the game’s always-online requirement</a>. This would not have been such an issue with an offline play option, though that obviously has consequences for the game’s internal economy and progression.</p>

<p>Another potential factor is that developers have been going on strike against publisher Nacon in the last couple weeks, organising under the union banner of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/category/news-en/">Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (SJV)</a>. RPG developer Spiders went on strike last week, and on Monday they were joined by colleageues at Kylotonn, who complained:</p>
<p><em>“Management regularly brings up the studios’ supposed independence, but every demand we make gets rejected with the argument that there should be coherence within the Nacon group. Much in the same way, negotiations are hampered under the same pretense.</em></p>
<p><em>“If no improvement in our working conditions is offered because “it would drive other studios within the group to ask for the same”, it stands to reason then that we make those demands together.”</em></p>
<p>Nacon has entered into discussions with workers already last week, but complaints have not yet been fully addressed, and further strikes could potentially hamper Solar Crown’s launch.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems like a difficult time at KT Racing right now. We hope that they’re able to resolve the server issues soon, and also that negotiations with workers company-wide are able to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable.973569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everything I loved about<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is back in the sequel, just done in a bigger and better way. More importantly for some, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is more refined -- easier to get a grip on.</p>
<p>Because <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is so crunchy with so much emphasis on trying to be as realistic as possible, it’s an easy title to bounce off of. Layer on top of that a combat system that takes some time to get used to, and it can be an even tougher sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, from the brief time I played with the sequel, a lot of that is much easier to get a grip on and understand right away. The sequel is just as deep with just as many moving pieces as before, just easier to manage this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first place that is apparent is in the combat. It’s smoother, the visual cues are more clear, and it felt a lot more attainable to be competent enough quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to emphasize, however, that I don’t mean that <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is "dumbing down" what was already there. This is just a more refined system that has the side benefit of being more approachable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ability to block, after not having played the original in years mind you, was already better than before. I wasn't perfect by any means, and this was just a demo of course, so there's still a lot of meat on the bone for people to sink their teeth into.</p>
<p>Taking on the role of Henry again, it was like sleeping into a comfortable pair of shoes. The same humor and tone is throughout the story and dialogue with NPCs. If you were a fan of the writing in the original, you’ll be more than satisfied with <em>KCD 2</em> I imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While various game systems have been streamlined a bit more, like the combat, the biggest upgrade I experienced in my demo was just the sheer scale of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demo took place in Kuttenberg, a large German city in Bohemia. A real place, it was full of buildings, market stalls, taverns, guild halls, and so much more. Hundreds of NPCs were walking around &nbsp;going about their daily tasks.</p>

<p>The original game featured &nbsp;nothing of that scale at all, so seeing all of the intricate systems of<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> working together with so many NPCs densely packed together is going to be interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the historical aspects of the <em>Kingdom Come</em> series, then you’ll be happy to know that commitment to historical accuracy continues here as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is set in Bohemia, so we’ll be in an entirely new region from the first game. With historians on the team to keep things as close to accurate as possible, the time period and area have been meticulously recreated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the game will feature some cool actual historical events you’ll get to experience as Henry. For example, the city of Kuttenberg will be under siege at some point, which actually happened and is something Henry will get to see firsthand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I think what I played shows that Warhorse Studios is doing exactly what they need to do with <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. They've rounded some of the sharp edges while beefing up the best parts of the game. &nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II was demoed on a PC at PAX West 2024.</p>

It’s also possible this is a really big mistake, though considering how many people had to look at and approve these images and the fact that they have remained up for hours, I’m leaning toward this being a teaser and not a screw-up. </p><p>Now we just have to wait for Sony to actually, officially, for real, announce the PS5 Pro, which is rumored to be launching later this year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the biggest selling points of a new system, whether part of the current generation or the follow-up, is the technical specifications. If a system isn’t more powerful than what’s currently available, then what’s the point? So, what are the PS5 Pro specifications? Here’s everything we know about what’s under the hood on Sony’s new system!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-ps5-pro-specifications">Do We Know the PS5 Pro Specifications?</h2>



<p>Here’s what we currently know about the PS5 Pro specifications. Since we’re so close to the system’s rumored release date, it’s unlikely anything will change significantly between now and the release. If it does, however, we’ll update this guide to ensure you know precisely what you’re getting in the brand-new hardware!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>System Memory</strong>: 576 GB/s (18GT/s) – A staggering 28% increase over the current PlayStation 5 console.</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Identical to the current PlayStation 5 console but with “High CPU Frequency Mode,” which increases the CPU to 3.85GHZ.</li>



<li><strong>Audio</strong>: ACV at a higher clock speed than the current PlayStation 5 console, with a 35% increase in performance.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>
<ul>
<li>45% faster rendering than the current PlayStation 5 console</li>



<li>2-3x Ray-tracing</li>



<li>33.5 Teraflops</li>



<li>PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling)</li>



<li>Support for up to 8K resolutions</li>



<li>Custom machine learning architecture</li>



<li>AI Accelerator, supporting up to 300 TOPS of 8-bit computation / 67 TFLOPS of 16-bit floating point</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Software</strong>: SKD 9.00 (SKD 10.00 expected in Fall 2024)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-the-ps5-pro-worth-it">Is The PS5 Pro Worth It?</h2>



<p>If you’re a big fan of high graphical fidelity in your video games, then you’ll likely find the new technical specifications of the PlayStation 5 Pro worthwhile. It’s a more robust system overall, meaning better graphics and a more streamlined experience when enjoying games at home on a 4K television.</p>

While Netflix’s original anime spin-off, <em>Terminator Zero</em>, doesn’t entirely shake the uncanny sameness of its predecessors, it boldly returns to the series long-lost core theme: “No fate but what we make.”<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195369" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="195369,193144,193799" data-current="195369"><div><p>Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20838.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At first, it seems like<em> Terminator Zero</em>, written by <em>The Batman</em> co-writer Mattson Tomill and animated by <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> studio Production I.G., retreads the same narrative beats of every film from<em> Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</em> to <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>: killer robots are going back in time to snuff out humanity. And intially at least, it seems that <em>Terminator Zero</em> is treading that teritory as well, with its time-jumping hero Eiko (played by <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s Sonoya Mizuno) tasked with protecting a scientist and his children from a Terminator hellbent on stopping a rival AI program from thwarting Skynet. To make matters worse, she has 24 hours to save them all from Timothy Olyphant’s terrifying Terminator before Skynet goes online and kickstarts a nuclear holocaust.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while <em>Terminator Zero</em>’s eight episodes are filled with the typical gory killing sprees and callback catchphrases the series is known for, the anime offers a shocking revelation in its sixth episode: all this time traveling isn’t changing the existing futures, it’s creating separate timelines. Instead of using this twist to deter its hero on the futility of her mission, <em>Terminator </em>Zero weaponizes this revelation to light a fire under Eiko, just like the one that drove Sarah Connor in <em>Terminator 2</em>.<br></p><p>In the original <em>Terminator</em>, time-traveling hero Kyle Reese brings Sarah a message from her son John, the leader of humanity’s resistance in his grim future, which includes the phrase, “The future is not set.” From there, the idea that there is “no fate but what we make” became <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/No_Fate_(quote)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/No_Fate_(quote)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a refrain in the <em>Terminator </em>films</a></span>, and though Eiko has learned that she can’t change fate for the people she knows because her actions can only create a new branch in time, rather than alter an existing one,&nbsp;she nonetheless decides that a new present and a completely different future are something worth fighting for. Mix that in with some existential debates between an AI and its creator about whether or not humanity is a disease that should be purged, and a Terminator with a retrofitted crossbow attachment to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/videos/terminator-zero-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-clip&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/terminator-zero-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circumvent Japanese gun laws</a></span>, and you’ve got a pretty smart anime on your hands.<br></p><p>Speaking with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-zero-mattson-tomlin-searched-reddit-ive-got-to-just-try-not-to-make-everybody-mad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-zero-mattson-tomlin-searched-reddit-ive-got-to-just-try-not-to-make-everybody-mad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Tomill recounted how he navigated developing a story for a world that already has its own—albeit uneven—canon while putting his own emotional spin on its storytelling.</p><p>“I don’t recommend you do what I did, [but] if you get on Reddit for four seconds, you very quickly go, ‘Okay, there’s a lot of things [fans] don’t want. And then there’s a lot of things that they do, and then there’s kind of this in-between area,’” Tomill said. “And so for me, it’s going on a journey of [asking], ‘Why does this need to exist in 2024? What is it that I have to say that is real, that is emotional?’<br></p><p>He continues: “For me, once I find something emotional and something where [I go], ‘Oh, I can use this as the vessel to tell an emotional story that really means something to me,’ then it’s just a matter of going, ‘Okay, what do people expect?’ Well, they expect Terminators. I think that they expect a level of time travel. They expect, whether or not they would articulate it this way, a story about families. The first movie is a love story between a man and a woman, and the second one is a mother-son story. And so I think it’s about sticking to those tenets and then going, ‘Okay, now I’ve got to just try not to make everybody mad.’”<br></p><p>While your mileage may vary with the Netflix anime’s surface-level moral quandaries,&nbsp;<em>Terminator Zero</em> boasts the best writing the troubled franchise has had in the last 30 years. Hopefully the series will steer clear of leaning on the crutch of Arnold Swarzenegger’s T-800 and Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor, should it get the green light for a second season.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It feels like this console generation is going on significantly longer than usual, though it’s not. If you look back at historical data for the major systems, we’re only about halfway through the lifespan of this current generation, give or take, which means there’s room for improvement and new versions to launch worldwide. First up is the PS5 Pro, right? When will the PS5 Pro be released to us eager fans?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-ps5-pro-release-date">When is the PS5 Pro Release Date?</h2>



<p>While we don’t yet have an official release date for the PS5 Pro, rumors indicate it will launch <strong>sometime in November</strong>. That’s perfect timing, of course. It’s right before the holiday season, before most people start buying all of their presents for friends and family, meaning Sony could snag a ton of holiday sales. Of course, that is dependent on the cost of the system. If it’s too expensive, many will wait.</p>



<p>Following the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th-anniversary image leak</a>, which includes the PS5 Pro outline, Sony will either drip-feed us teasers until it’s time for an official reveal or showcase the whole system before any more leaks ruin the surprise. It’ll be interesting to see!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-we-see-more-from-playstation">When Will We See More From PlayStation?</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming previously reported on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play coming sometime in late September</a>. If that’s the case, the big console reveal will likely happen then and there. I can’t think of a better time for Sony to unveil such a massive bombshell like a brand-new system. If they reveal the system at the end of September, then a November launch certainly makes the most sense.</p>

Photo source: IGN Japan.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>How did the remaster of Shadows of the Damned come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Goichi Suda, Founder, Grasshopper Manufacture:</strong> We started receiving offers to port Shadows of the Damned about eight years ago. My studio Grasshopper Manufacture was keen to do it, but at the time, Shadows of the Damned was exclusive to Origin, the digital distribution platform operated by EA. As a result, the talks of a port fell through.</p><p>Since we couldn’t port the game, I gave up for a while. But I still had the desire to release some older Grasshopper Manufacture titles for modern consoles. I was able to make that happen with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-silver-case">The Silver Case</a>, and I was also able to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/killer-7">Killer 7</a> on Steam, and then release No More Heroes 3 as a new title. I thought Shadows of the Damned would be next, and I was finally able to make it happen.”</p><p><strong>With Grasshopper Manufacture now under the umbrella of NetEase Games, did that help to make it possible?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> Yes. After I joined NetEase Games, I talked about wanting to release a remaster of Shadows of the Damned. That was about two years ago. At that time, it was no longer an Origin-exclusive title, so the situation had changed to the point where Shadows of the Damned could be released on other platforms. NetEase Games gave me the OK, so we started developing the remaster. NetEase Games gives me a great deal of freedom and creates an environment that makes it easy to work. I ended up telling Mikami after the fact that I was making a remaster of Shadows of the Damned [laughs]. I asked him for a comment as part of the promotion, and he came with me all the way to gamescom!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I had thought [Tango Gameworks] would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games</p></div><p><strong>What are some of the differences in the remastered version? </strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> We added a New Game Plus mode, where players who have beaten the game can go back in and play again with all the upgrades they got the first time around. This game has an RPG element where you can upgrade your weapon, and by the end of the story you will be much stronger; so if you use that weapon from the beginning of your second playthrough, you can mow down weak enemies like an invincible force.</p><p>We had requests for a New Game Plus mode ever since the original game was released, so we definitely wanted to include it in the remastered version. We have also introduced new costumes, some of which you can unlock in the second playthrough, so keep an eye out for those as well. The remaster has allowed us to implement everything we had hoped to include in the original game.”</p><p><strong>How about the visual upgrades?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> The remastered version supports a maximum resolution of 4K. It also supports a smoother 60fps. The PS5/Xbox Series X/PC version supports 4K, and the Switch version is 30fps. In the original version, some cutscenes were pre-rendered, but in the remastered version, they have been changed to real-time cutscenes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Going back a little, why did you two first decide to work together on this game?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> I made a game with Mikami called Killer 7, which was released by Capcom in 2005. After Killer 7 was finished, I showed Mikami an idea for a game called Kurayami [Darkness].</p><p><strong>Shinji Mikami, Former Studio Head, Tango Gameworks:</strong> I really liked the outline for Kurayami, but there was no way the Capcom management would have approved it at the time. I had no choice but to give up, but we agreed to look out for other opportunities to work together.”</p><p><strong>Suda: </strong>A few years later, Grasshopper Manufacture started to think about expanding overseas. We decided to present several plans to publishers outside of Japan, including Kurayami, and Mikami accompanied us. About three companies were interested, but we ended up signing a contract with EA.</p><p><strong>Mr Mikami, what made you want to work with Mr Suda to develop a game?</strong></p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> Because the idea for Kurayami was really good. The biggest reason was that I had been waiting for the day when I could make it a reality. Working with Suda is fun, so there’s no downside. When it was decided that we would work together on Shadows of the Damned, I was as excited as I could possibly be. Well, a lot happened after that.” [Laughs]</p><p><strong>Suda: </strong>[Laughs] I've always been indebted to Mikami.</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> When the development of Shadows of the Damned was reaching its climax, I was also working as the director of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/18/vanquish-review">Vanquish (2010) at PlatinumGames</a>, so it was really tough. In the middle of that busy time, I received an email from Suda. Apparently, he wanted to redesign the main character of Shadows of the Damned from scratch. I was surprised because the character design had already been finalized.</p><p><strong>Why did you suddenly decide to change the design of the main character?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> I got bored of it [laughs]. As I looked at the old design of the protagonist over and over, I started to feel like it didn’t quite fit. I thought that maybe players would feel the same, so I decided to change the character design. I think we changed him twice during development.”</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> That’s right, this was the second time – that’s when we landed on the final design of Garcia Hotspur. I was horrified at the time. I couldn’t believe we were changing the design of the protagonist at such a late stage!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>And Mr. Suda, why did you want to develop a game with Mr Mikami?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> Mikami gives me a sense of security. Sometimes when a game director has been working on a game for a long time, they may become unsure of some of their ideas. You think something is interesting, but you don’t know if others will feel the same. In those situations, Mikami will always give accurate judgment calls. Sometimes he would guide me by saying, ‘It would be better if you did it this way.’</p><p>Without wanting to over-analyze his talents, Mikami’s experience as a director has enabled him to make accurate judgments. Even after working with him on Killer7, I wanted to work with him again on developing a game. As a producer, Mikami takes the stance of ‘protecting’ the project from external influence, so it’s very easy to work with him.”</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> I think we were able to fulfill most of Suda’s requests for Killer7. That said, we had wanted to rework the game’s cutscenes from scratch, but we weren’t able to.</p><p><strong>Mr. Mikami, last year you left Tango Gameworks, the studio you founded, and then the studio was closed down in June this year. Then in August it was announced that Krafton would buy the studio and continue the Hi-Fi Rush series. How did you feel about that news?</strong></p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-wanted-to-leave-tango-gameworks-years-before-he-did">That’s one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks</a>. So I was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-shares-brief-reaction-to-studio-closure">surprised</a> when the studio was closed down.</p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> It was a bolt from the blue, wasn’t it?” </p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> Now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton has taken over the business</a>, so I feel like it worked out well in the end. I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company. I think that for a development studio, making a good game is more directly related to survival than making a popular game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p><strong>Can either of you tell us anything about what games you’re making next?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> In addition to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hotel-barcelona-preview-a-game-by-2-japanese-legends-that-has-you-fight-alongside-yourself">Hotel Barcelona</a>, which Swery [Hidetaka Suehiro] is working on, we at Grasshopper are making a brand-new action game. It’s a completely new IP, so I can’t say much about it yet. But I'm glad that Hotel Barcelona was well received when it was shown recently at BitSummit.</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> As for me, I’m working directly on a game [at Kamuy], but I can’t tell you anything yet.”</p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> So you’re making something.”</p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> Yes, I’m not just a producer – I’m directly involved in development.”</p><p><strong>If the two of you were to develop a new title together, what kind of thing would you like to make?</strong></p><p><strong>Mikami:</strong> I’d like to make a sequel to Killer 7. But it might be difficult, since Capcom owns the IP.</p><p><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is due October 31, 2024, on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC (Steam).</em></p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/NoMoreDaniels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Daniel Robson</em></u></a><em> and </em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> are editors for IGN Japan, and conducted the interview at gamescom. </em><a href="https://x.com/ryuichi_kataoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Ryuichi Kataoka</em></u></a><em> is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When I think of developer MachineGames, I think of dual-wielding shotguns in its Wolfenstein games, sprinting down tight corridors with guns blazing as the walls get a fresh coat of Nazi blood. After all, MachineGames' entire portfolio up to this point has been built on the brazen revival of Wolfenstein--a series of five no-holds-barred, blood-soaked action thrill-rides. And damn did it do it well. It's why I was caught by surprise when seeing its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, is putting an emphasis on more methodical combat that will have you solving puzzles and using the environment as your weapon, rather than shooting your way out of every scenario and being covered in Nazi blood in the process ('tis a shame).</p><p dir="ltr">"It is always a big challenge to go from something known, into the unknown of what the Indiana Jones game was for us," Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's design director, Jens Andersson, told GameSpot at Gamescom 2024. "It's tough, because the way [MachineGames] is used to working--how we build levels, how we design enemies--everything is coming from this action [focus]. And now we're coming at it from a different side. So it took a long time. Like, honestly, a really long time for us at company meetings and stuff, talking about 'What is this game trying to do?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qThZsYHca4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8qThZsYHca4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Don't worry, you'll still get to shoot your share of Nazis in the Great Circle, but as Indy, it's your wits, your mitts, your whip, and maybe the occasional rolling pin left on a kitchen table that will be your primary tools. In putting you in the shoes (and hat) of the globe-trotting Dr. Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones Jr., your agency as a player isn't <em>just action</em>, but exploration and investigation. It's a molding of genres and mechanics seldom seen all in one game, let alone a first-person one.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think even more for this particular game, there aren't too many references out there," Andersson said. "Like it's an adventure-first game. So what does a AAA adventure game look like today? We don't know. We had to figure it out."</p><p dir="ltr">The adventure-game genre is broad and rather hard to define. At one point in time, it was often linked to more traditional point-and-click games, like Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, for example. These games were heavily driven by narrative with puzzle-solving front-and-center of its design and very rarely, if at all, featured combat. Modern audiences, however, may point to the Uncharted series as a touching point for what a modern adventure game is--those are action-packed games that sees their Indiana Jones-inspired protagonist Nathan Drake mowing down hundreds of bad guys through blockbuster-sized set pieces. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn't seem to fall in either category, and it even feels unfair to place it somewhere in the middle of that broad spectrum.</p><p dir="ltr">For game director Jerk Gustafasson, figuring out this game's identity started with a simple reminder to the team: This is a "MachineGames adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">"When that was mentioned in a meeting," said Andersson, "that's when a lot of the team began to say 'Oh, I see what you mean.' Like MachineGames means cinematic, immersive, action, first-person. So what's the adventure version of that?"</p><p dir="ltr">From there, creative director Axel Torvenius felt that meant doubling down on adventure and exploration rather than relying on the studio's tried-and-true action background. "There's a lot of slower moments. And because [they're] slower moments doesn't mean they're boring," said Torvenius. "Quite the opposite--it's very intense and exciting. It's slow-paced, but it's still high tension and filled with a sense of adventure, and that's what we've been trying to get. It's to get that balance right."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFXwKJEHfA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/doFXwKJEHfA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Based on the hands-off gameplay I saw, those quieter moments that Torvenius referred to are spent using Indy's camera, taking pictures of artifacts that in turn fill your journal with information. This information is vital to informing the player on where to go next or answering questions within the game's mystery. That, of course, comes with its own challenge of pacing and assisting the player on what to do and where to go, without holding their hand too much.</p><p dir="ltr">"How do we push the player to do something, when before, everything we did were linear corridor shooters--which sometimes opened up a little bit, but never that much--to something in game style and game pace was vastly different," said Torvenius.</p><p dir="ltr">It couldn't be further from what I was used to seeing this team do with its games, and it's MachineGames' full embrace of something so different that began to get me most excited for what Indiana Jones and the Great Circle could be: something genuinely fresh to the first-person genre, regardless of the Indiana Jones IP.</p><blockquote><p>"The writing and the characters are front-and-center, rather than sidekicks to the action."</p><cite>Jens Andersson</cite></blockquote><p dir="ltr">This is a team, after all, that's had a long lineage in the first-person genre, long before MachineGames was formed. Many of the Great Circle's team had worked together at developer Starbreeze Entertainment on games like The Darkness, and before that, the slower-paced Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, which, like Indiana Jones, relied heavily on hand-to-hand combat and stealth. The two games, while both first-person, vary greatly in gameplay. But the team's approach to its design always starts with the story first. It's, as Andersson puts it, the MachineGames process.</p><p dir="ltr">"It starts with the story, as trivial as that sounds," Andersson said. "We adapt everything to sort of fit around that story rather than the other way around that I think a lot of other studios do. [...] The writing and the characters are front-and-center, rather than sidekicks to the action."</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to be swept up in Wolfenstein's signature run-and-gun action, but it's MachineGames' approach to storytelling and character development which made Wolfenstein's The New Order and The New Colossus so memorable for me. When I think of Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus in particular, I instantly think of its softer moments: the surprise birthday party for B.J. Blazkowicz; the memories of his childhood sweetheart; or the relationship he had with his mother. These scenes gave its characters time to breathe between the fumes of gunsmoke and made it all the more memorable for doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's too soon to say whether MachineGames can land the same writing heights in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it is clear at the moment that it's translating the titular character's identity exceptionally well, especially in the game's combat.</p><p dir="ltr">During gameplay, the player used Indy's whip to disarm an enemy, causing them to lose their balance and fall face-first into a steel barrel, knocking them out cold. It was a small and brief moment, but one that rang of slapstick comedy and gave combat its own brand of charisma. For as quick as that encounter was, achieving that goal was by no means easy for the team.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4362874-indy_whip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4362874-indy_whip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362874"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4362874-indy_whip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We have this very complicated system of people being pushed into the environment. So you can use the whip to get people around," Andersson explained. "A lot of work was involved in having enemies react and catch their balance. It was a scary proposition when we started pushing for it. Everyone was not happy with us. But like this combination of simulation and animation and being able to interact with the environment and being able to pick up stuff, like it's so Indy, right?"</p><p dir="ltr">There's a comical pacing in its combat that feels improvisational opposed to scripted, much like some of the film franchise's most-iconic scenes, whether it's pulling a gun out to shoot the flailing swordsman in Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Indy patiently waiting for the propellers of a plane to chop a Nazi to bits. It's these moments that reflect Indy as a character, and translating that organically through combat is very exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, as a hardcore Wolfenstein fan, I'm still pining for the next entry in the Blazkowicz family saga. However, I've become equally as excited to see how MachineGames expands its writing and design philosophies to story altogether, regardless of whether or not I'm an Indiana Jones fan.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release December 9 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be a day-one Game Pass release.</p>

                <p>On December 3, 1994, Sony launched the original PlayStation in Japan and changed the video game industry forever. American gamers didn't get their hands on the PS until September 9, 1995, but Sony's not going to make us wait another year to start the celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary. And the first plans for that year-long party have been revealed.</p><p>From October to the end of January, Sony Music will release classic PlayStation game scores on Spotify and digital music storefronts. The confirmed titles include God of War, God of War II, God of War: Chains of Sparta, Twisted Metal, Starhawk, and Unit 13. ​</p><p>A free trial version of Gran Turismo 7 called My First GT will also be released. Sony hasn't set a date for the trial yet, but it will be released this holiday season for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users with some of the fan-favorite cars, tracks, and more from Gran Turismo 7.</p><p>Sports gaming enthusiasts should take note that September 21 and 22 will be a free online multiplayer weekend with multiple esports tournaments for games like Madden NFL 24, MLB The Show 24, NBA 2K25, NBA 2K24, and even fighting games like Tekken 8, Guilty Gear Strive, and EA UFC 5. You won't need a paid PlayStation Plus membership to compete a PS 30th anniversary-themed avatar and other prizes, but you will need a copy of the previously mentioned titles.</p><p>This is just the beginning, as additional plans for PlayStation's 30th anniversary will be announced at a later time. Some fans believe that Sony used the initial announcement to reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-sony-just-revealed-the-ps5-pro-design/1100-6526310/" data-ref-id="1100-6526310">the design of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">rumored to be officially unveiled soon</a>.</p><p>This week also marks the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a>, which is receiving rave reviews and features numerous references to games from PlayStation's history.</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I caught up with Rich Lambert, Game Director for Elder Scrolls Online at ZeniMax. This wasn't the first time I interviewed Rich - I met him in person <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-e3-2019-interview-focusing-on-performance-improvements-team-is-aware-crossplay-is-what-players-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at E3 2019</a>, and then we had a number of remote interviews over the past five years or so. This year, though, is special for the MMORPG, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-10th-anniversary-qa-with-rich-lambert-looking-back-and-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has turned 10</a>. ZeniMax is doing several celebrations with the community throughout the whole year, with the excuse that the console version launched around a year after the PC version.</p>
<p>With the release of Gold Road, the yearly expansion (or Chapter, as they like to call them) firmly behind us, we looked to its making and then moved to the future, answering quite a few long-standing community questions on highly requested features.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls Online - Welcome to Home Tours" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7i8xMctv4ss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You announced some new events as part of the 10-year celebration, right? In Milan and elsewhere.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Milan, San Diego, and then I don't know if it's 100% announced yet, but we'll go to PAX Australia as well.</p>
<p><strong>Cool. Overall, how is the ten-year anniversary of Elder Scrolls Online going for you so far?</strong></p>
<p>It's been amazing. The players and the community that has gone to these events are just really enjoying themselves. They get to see us, but they go to see their friends. In Amsterdam, we had a group that has been doing podcasts together for almost 10 years, and they've never actually met in person. One lives in Turkey, the other guy lives in the United States, and the first time they met each other face-to-face was at our Amsterdam event, which is cool. That just kind of echoes all the way across things. Also, putting the event together was really cool because we had to look at stuff we hadn't looked at in years—literally years—and so it's just been really cool.</p>
<p><strong>I imagine this is also kind of a unique opportunity to get more feedback on the game live from the fans.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, one hundred percent. We sit down; we talk with them. Actually, at the tavern, which was in July earlier this year, I had a number of people come up to me with thick books with just notes of things. Some of them were poems and pictures and stuff like that, but others were like, hey, we polled our Guild, and these are the things that we would love to see added or changed or updated in Elder Scrolls Online, so it was really cool.</p>
<p><strong>You <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Gold Road Chapter. What was the reception like compared to last year's Chapter, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>It's been really positive. Players have really reacted well to the zone. It's a forested type of area, but it's not greens and browns, right? It has bright colors and interesting environments. Then they love Ithelia, the new Daedric Prince we created. They absolutely love her.</p>
<p><strong>Since it was a different type of story from the ones you've done before in the game, what did you do differently? What were some of the challenges?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest challenge was that we were writing a brand new Daedric Prince, and that's never been done before. Figuring out how to make her stand on her own and not feel the same as all the others was a big challenge for us. And then like, what are her traits? Because a lot of the Daedric princes cover a lot of the different traits.</p>
<p>When we started going in and thinking about well, Hermaeus Mora is all about order and keeping everything in line and knowing everything. We started bouncing in on what's the antithesis of that? That's where we got into this chaos, the threads of fate and bouncing around, and so that was a really fun project to figure out. Once we got that, it helped inform some of the stories that are going on in this one.</p>
<p><strong>When you came up with the idea of Ithelia, was Bethesda Game Studios already on board with that, or did it take some convincing?</strong></p>
<p>It took a little negotiating. It's something new, right? And it's never been done before, but that's kind of how we work, frankly. We pitch ideas, we talk, we work things out. Dragons was a really good example of that as well. They didn't want us to do dragons initially at launch because they weren't in our timeline, or at least there was no recorded history in our timeline of dragons, and then we worked through 'What if we did it like this?'&nbsp;The players were the source of this. So, in the end, they were like, 'That's cool, it can work.'</p>
<p><strong>You've just released a new Elder Scrolls Online update dedicated to housing, right?</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, yeah, travel day to Gamescom. The team back home was hard at work launching Update 43. The big system that we added was Home Tours, which allows players to easily share their homes with other players so they can see what they've created with the housing system. Our housing system, as you know, is really unique in that you can build anything. You can put chairs and ceilings, you can put tables and chairs and sofas together to make some other objects, and so that creativity is something that was really hard to show off because you have to know somebody in order to go to their home. Now, they can just share it, and you can go there right away.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'With the crafting bag, it is a small number of items that stack nearly infinitely, but with a furnishing bag, it is a large number of items that don't stack. We're working through how to do that without destroying the Elder Scrolls Online servers and the database.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>On that note, here's a question from the community: they'd like to get a furnishing bag.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've heard that a lot. It is something that we've been looking into for a while. It's not as easy to do as the crafting bag because with the crafting bag and how databases are set up, it is very cheap; I guess it is the easiest way to say, or less intensive, to just implement a number in a row in a database than it is to add more rows.</p>
<p>With the crafting bag, it is a small number of items that stack nearly infinitely, but with a furnishing bag, it is a large number of items that don't stack. We're working through how to do that without destroying the Elder Scrolls Online servers and the database, because it's really expensive. We have millions of players all having thousands of objects, so it adds up very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>What about an Armory bag?</strong></p>
<p>An armory bag. We've talked a lot about that when we did the Armory system, and we went back and forth on whether we can just pull stuff out of your bank or not. And there were actually a lot of scenarios where players could break the game. For instance, what if your inventory's full and you're pulling stuff out or into the bank? Or your bank is full. What if there's lag? What happens if two items get duplicated, right? There's lots and lots of issues with doing that.</p>
<p>What we decided was we were just gonna not give the player more inventory before their item sets, and instead go the route of what we did with the stable, where you could still collect them all and get them out of your inventory, but not easily be able to swap back-and-forth.</p>
<p><strong>With Gold Road, you added Scribing, a precursor to Spellcrafting, to Elder Scrolls Online. How are you planning to build upon this new system in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, in Update 43, we did add some more scripts, which allow players to do more things with them. We added some Frost-based scripts, so now you can have Frosty magic if that's what you're into. I believe the updated number of unique combinations is 5500 or just over 5500, so there's lots of opportunities to mix and match stuff. But if players continue to play the system and really enjoy the system, we are going to continue to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Does that include styling as well?</strong></p>
<p>Styling actually had a bunch of new additions in Update 43 as well.</p>
<p><strong>What about new Sorcerer pet models or skins?</strong></p>
<p>We have had a lot of feedback on this well, ever since we did the Warden and the Bear skin with that. For the Sorcerer pets, it is not a 'we don't want to do it', it is more a 'how do we not blow the game up doing it'? Because there are a lot of performance issues with that. But we have absolutely been looking at that.</p>
<p><strong>Will companions be able to wear helmets in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We made the design decision really early on that we wanted the characters to always be visible because that is their one personality trait, the unique face. We kind of go back and forth on that, but that was the original intent. Players can customize their abilities and all that other stuff, but we still wanted their personality to show.</p>
<p><strong>What about them using player gear?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know. That's a good question. I'd have to dig into that war. Companion gear is different from player gear. We did that again for performance reasons. The player items are very, very expensive on the database, and all the companion items are not, so whether or not they could actually wear player gear in the future is something we have to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, you introduced curation for the Undaunted. What about curating other stuff like motif pages that can drop from city daily quests?</strong></p>
<p>We're slowly going through and looking at those pain points. We did the Undaunted this past update. I don't think I'm speaking out of turn, but we also did some Imperial City curation. We curated the weekly Trial rewards as well, so we're going through that and looking at what makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Can you make mount upgrades work for all characters?</strong></p>
<p>We get that feedback a lot, too. Not easily.</p>
<p><strong>Could you ramp up the speed with which old styles are made available again?</strong></p>
<p>I can talk to the group that manages all that. There's a kind of a balance in that if you do it too much and too often, then players get overwhelmed, so we have to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>Can you increase the total furnishings in the house?</strong></p>
<p>We've got that one a lot, too, and those limits are there for performance. What we don't want to ever happen is a player puts something in their home and then they crash and can never get back in there. That's why the limits exist, but we are looking at ways to improve and increase that. But they're there for that reason. We don't ever want players to be in a situation where they can't access the house.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of performance, you still support PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but there are already whispers of the console generation that will follow PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. The question is, how long do you plan to support them for Elder Scrolls Online? Will you maybe drop them at some point?</strong></p>
<p>As long as players are on them and playing, it doesn't make sense to remove them. We have shown in the past that we will do it when it makes sense. With Windows 7, we supported it for a very, very long time. When it became end-of-life and Microsoft stopped supporting it, and there were fewer and fewer players actually on it, we dropped support.</p>
<p><strong>So you still see a lot of players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?</strong></p>
<p>There's tons of players. And on Mac as well, that's another one we get questions about why we support Mac. Because there's players there to play. We don't ever want to take it away if we can.</p>
<p><strong>Elder Scrolls Online recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on GeForce NOW. Did you see an influx of new players from the cloud?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>I asked you before in a previous interview, but are there any talks with Microsoft about adding the game on Game Pass?</strong></p>
<p>It's on Game Pass for consoles but not on Game Pass PC. There are various technical reasons why it's not there, but we are looking at it because we get a lot of game continues, and it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>I know you completed the server hardware upgrade a while ago. Are you still looking at ways to improve server performance beyond that?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the new hardware helped, and for the most part, things are pretty stable and solid. However, there are absolutely still periods during peak hours when it's not as good as we want, so we're definitely looking into further improvement.</p>
<p><strong>The next update will focus primarily on PvP. Are there any tidbits that you can share? Anything at all?</strong></p>
<p>I believe Gina Bruno (<em>the Elder Scrolls Online Community Manager</em>) let slip that it might be Battleground-related.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The new server hardware helped, and for the most part, things are pretty stable and solid. However, there are absolutely still periods during peak hours when it's not as good as we want, so we're definitely looking into further improvement.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What about the Alliance War? Are you doing anything about that?</strong></p>
<p>That's where we start to look at performance, and then also at some quality life, such as item curation. Then we're constantly adding new cosmetics that you can earn through PvP, adding new item sets and Rewards for the Worthy.</p>
<p><strong>I know this is a question you get asked repeatedly, but do you have any thoughts about crossplay? Is it even doable?</strong></p>
<p>It's never been a no; it's always been a holy hell. We made many decisions in 2007 that are very difficult to change, and then we'd have to get all of the first parties together to make sure that they're good with how we would go about implementing. It's a huge technical challenge to solve. Do I think we will get there in the future? Maybe. I think that's where technology is just going in general. People just want to be together and make it easy and remove all the friction to play with each other. But like I said, we started building this game in 2007, when that wasn't even remotely a thought in anybody's head back then.</p>
<p><strong>On that note. Elder Scrolls Online has turned 10. How long do you have a roadmap for internally?</strong></p>
<p>Game development, there's a fuzziness to that, right? We have a 5-year plan of where we want to go, then we have like a 3-year, more solidified plan of the things that we want to focus on, and then we have an 18-month locked-in roadmap. We're constantly iterating and updating that. Just because we have a 5-year plan doesn't mean we will stop after 5 years; it's just that's as far ahead as we have the brain power to think, at least right now, but as long as players want to continue playing the game, we're going to continue to support and update Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/">blog post</a> earlier today included a 30th anniversary image (above), and eagle-eyed observers <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1831772340218425426?t=K1MbVYnbDeXJP8fX75S4kg&amp;s=19">have spotted</a> a suspicious-looking PS5 design in the montage that looks identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">PS5 Pro leak</a> from a week ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs reported last week</a> that it had seen retail packaging for the PS5 Pro and created a sketch that showed three black stripes in the middle of the outer facades of the console. Those three black strips can be clearly seen in Sony’s montage image, looking rather Adidas-like and unlike the stripe you can find on the PS5. In fact, the existing PS5 model is also in the montage, with a single stripe through the middle.</p><div><figcaption><em>Sony’s image vs. the leaked PS5 Pro sketch.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony / <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs</a></cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Sony’s Instagram story.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Dealabs said it was expecting an announcement during the first half of September, but I don’t think anyone expected it would come in the form of a teaser image from Sony. The official PlayStation account on Instagram even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/playstation/">posted the image</a> with a “Your first look 👀” link.</p><p>We’ve known for months the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">PS5 Pro is real</a> and that developers have been getting their games ready for this new console. A source familiar with Sony’s PS5 Pro plans tells me that all games released on or after September 16th need to support the PS5 Pro, so that suggests that Sony’s official announcement of this console is coming real soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a> was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).
</p>
<p>If you do still own a physical copy of Black &amp; White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black &amp; White, and its first build was just released yesterday.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Openblack has been in development for several years - since at least 2018 - with people contributing to the project over on Github. You can now <a href="https://github.com/openblack/openblack?tab=readme-ov-file">download it as a pre-built binary</a>, although there's still some command line fiddling necessary to actually get it to run.
</p>
<p>That command line requirement is a signal that it's still in many ways early days for the project. Its developers consider it v0.10, so I wouldn't necessarily rush to dig out your old discs yet. Still, there's a lot of potential here for those seeking a version of Black &amp; White that runs better on modern machines and which has support for more operating systems. There's already a Linux build available, for example.
</p>
<p>In short, I'd like to be able to play Black &amp; White on Steam Deck one day, and this is likely the only avenue by which that's ever going to happen.
</p>
<p>Even if it's impossible to buy digitally, it's not impossible to play Black &amp; White on modern computers if you do own a copy, merely less than ideal. For those willing to try, I think <a href="https://www.bwgame.net/threads/running-black-white-on-windows-10.7916/">these old instructions</a>, which includes installing a slightly-modernising fan patch, should still work.
</p>
<p>And of course, if it's a choice between following a fan-led open source project to modernise Black &amp; White, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-is-back-with-new-god-sim-masters-of-albion-which-looks-like-a-stripped-down-black-white">following Masters Of Albion</a>, I'd wager the former is more worth my time.</p>

<p>As someone who only recently bought a PlayStation 5, I’m on the fence about a PS5 Pro reveal. I’m excited about all-new hardware and, hopefully, a more powerful system overall for this console generation. But at the same time, what about a PlayStation 6? Anyway, let’s not focus too far ahead in the future. When will the PS5 Pro be revealed to the masses?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-sony-officially-reveal-the-ps5-pro">When Will Sony Officially Reveal the PS5 Pro?</h2>



<p>According to rumors, Sony will officially unveil the PlayStation 5 Pro sometime this month, in September, but there’s no precise date just yet. Following a recent tease in their 30th-anniversary image, which you can check out here at Insider Gaming, two versions of the upcoming console were sneakily revealed to the world. More specifically, their silhouette and design.</p>



<p>Back in March, we reported that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro was in development</a> and may launch in late 2024, before the holiday season. As rumors and leaks start to ramp up, it appears we were on the money.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-a-ps5-pro">Should You Buy a PS5 Pro?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>While it’s your money and your decision to buy a PS5 Pro whenever it launches, we can tell you that, according to information circulating about the system, it is supposed to feature 45% faster rendering than the current PlayStation 5 systems, along with a new resolution upscaling method known as PSSR, alongside other technical features and a sleek new design. If you don’t mind spending a bit of money on yourself, the PS5 Pro may wind up being an excellent investment, so long as Sony continues pumping out quality single-player titles and not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mishaps like Concord</a>!</p>



<p>When the PS5 Pro is revealed, will you be among the first in line to pre-order the system?</p>



<hr>



<p>I can’t think of a better game for the PS5 Pro than Hogwarts Legacy 2, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. Games recently revealed is a top priority</a> for its studio now!</p>

<p>Sony has teased the PlayStation 5 Pro Design in an image celebrating PlayStation’s 30th anniversary.</p>



<p>Albeit a difficult tease to spot if you didn’t know what you were looking for, the PlayStation 30th anniversary shows the outline of the  PlayStation 5 Pro, which is easily recognizable thanks to the multiple lines in the middle of the console. From the image below, you can see the PlayStation 5 Pro in the middle, whereas the standard PlayStation 5 (the revised/latest version) to the right.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Last week, dataminer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-will-have-a-similar-design-to-the-slim-models-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billbil-kun revealed that the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will have multiple lines/slits in the panel of the console. Billbil-kun findings suggest that it’s been uploaded on the backend of retailer websites… somewhere, indicating that the console will soon be announced.</p>



<p>In March 2023, Insider Gaming reported that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro was in development</a> and could be released in late 2024. According to sources, as of late, the console is scheduled to release sometime in November.</p>



<p>The recent PlayStation tease does suggest that the announcement is imminent, with the latest rumors suggesting that the console could be revealed in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>You can read <span>about the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-more-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro specs here.</a></span>&nbsp;It will have 45% faster rendering than the standard PlayStation 5, new resolution upscaling called PSSR, and more.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the PS5 Pro? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>
This December marks 30 years since the Japanese launch of the original PlayStation, and Sony has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/">revealed</a> how it plans to celebrate the brand's big three-oh - with the likes of digital soundtracks, PlayStation-themed toys, and more on the way.
</p>
<p>
Sony's celebrations begin later this month, with a free online multiplayer event and esports tournament running from 21st-22nd September. For the duration, it'll be possible to play online multiplayer in any PS4 or PS5 game without having a PlayStation Plus subscription.
</p>
<p>
The concurrent PS5 esports tournament, meanwhile, will feature challenges for the likes of EA UFC 5, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8</a>, and Guilty Gear Strive, with specific details set to be published via the <a href="http://compete.playstation.com/">PlayStation Competition Centre</a> at a later date. A special 30th anniversary avatar and other game-specific prizes will be up for grabs, and interested players can sign up to compete via the PS5's Game Hub or the in-game PlayStation Tournaments button.

<p>Fortnite posted a Tweet earlier today (September 5, 2024) claiming that the Battle Royale will be partnering with NASCAR ahead of Globals, the massive Fortnite tournament championship happening this weekend.</p>



<p>So, what does this partnership mean for the racing sport and the Battle Royale?</p>



<h2 id="h-nascar-partners-with-fortnite-for-globals">NASCAR Partners With Fortnite For Globals</h2>



<p>Fortnite Globals is a yearly event that takes the best players around the world who qualified during the year’s various FNCS events and puts them all together in one arena. It is the best of the best going head-to-head against each other. </p>



<p>And now, it seems as if NASCAR is joining in on the fun.</p>



<p>The official Fortnite Competitive Twitter posted a Tweet today, saying: “Nascar is ready to bring the energy to the FNCS Global Championship! Stay tuned for more content!”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this is the only information we have been given thus far, it does confirm that the popular sport will be a part of the massive Fortnite event.</p>











<p>No large esports event is official without any large title sponsors. Fortnite is no exception to this rule. The game has partnered with quite a few large names and companies in the past. This, however, is Fortnite’s first venture with NASCAR.</p>



<p>So, will NASCAR have something to do with Fortnite Globals? Or will they simply just reveal more details about the partnership at the tournament?</p>



<p>Fortnite is notorious for building something up only to have it be a bit of a letdown in the public eye. We will just have to be patient and wait until more is announced at Globals.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-returning-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-reveals-he-is-returning-tomorrow.973446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-returning-tomorrow/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dr Disrespect hasn’t been seen in front of a camera since the end of June when allegations surfaced online implicating him in a ‘minor messaging’ scandal. He since copped to the wrongdoing and was subsequently dropped by his peers, sponsors, and companies he worked with before plunging into radio silence amid an ‘extended vacation’.</p>



<p>He has just announced he’s returning tomorrow.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-again-but-what-awaits-him">Back Again, But What Awaits Him?</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect is coming back to streaming tomorrow. The charismatic and controversial content creator posted a cinematic ‘trailer’ on social media revealing his return, and it was created in the aesthetic that the streamer’s fans have come to know over the years, suggesting that nothing has changed for ‘The Two Time’.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>He then posted a comment immediately under the trailer in an attempt to pre-empt some of the inevitable responses:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WHeRe’s He CoMinG from, Epstein iSlAnd? </p>



<p>iTs a pDf nOt a DoC </p>



<p>hE BloCkEd mE, leT Me TaKe a ScReEnsHot aNd PosT</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitting he was banned</a> from Twitch in 2020 after messaging a minor in 2017 through the platform, Dr Disrespect has lost tens of thousands of followers across all platforms. He was demonetised on YouTube, and his key sponsors – such as Turtle Beach – cut ties with him.</p>



<p>In recent days, Dr Disrespect suggested that he might not be coming back to play games, making a post claiming that people streaming video games were hosting ‘snoozefests’. Despite the controversy surrounding the notorious streamer, millions of impressions have been landed within mere hours of his post going live, and even some supporters have come out of the woodwork.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that nobody knows what his return will look like – he’s just adamant that it’s happening tomorrow.</p>

<section><p>The upcoming Atlus title is easily the game--and election--I am most looking forward to as 2024 comes to a close.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>If you're curious as to why Atlus chose the name Metaphor: ReFantazio for its forthcoming RPG, you're not alone. In fact, it was one of the first questions asked during a recent press event held by the studio in New York City, in which GameSpot and various other outlets were given the opportunity to play five hours of Metaphor: ReFantazio and chat with some of its core development team members.</p><p dir="ltr">The answer to the question is just as simple as it is intriguing: It's because the entire game itself is a metaphor, producer Junichi Yoshizawa explained. And though that might sound obtuse or perhaps even a bit hamfisted, it didn't take long for me to understand and appreciate just what he meant.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas many fantasy worlds bear a resemblance to our own and contain themes and stories we recognize or relate to, Metaphor: ReFantazio is quick to emphasize and explore this connection. In the game's opening moments, for example, an unnamed voice asks you for your name--not what you want to name your character, but <em>your</em> name. He then asks how you view the idea of fantasy. This metanarrative pops up throughout, as the protagonist frequently turns to a novel he carries with him, one containing stories about a technologically advanced land with skyscrapers, roads, and humans living peacefully--a fantasy version of our own world. There are many ways this could go wrong; the game could feel preachy, cheesy, or annoyingly meta, for starters. And yet, what I played of Metaphor: ReFantazio avoided falling into any of those traps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362836" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362836"></a><figcaption>The game's protagonist approaches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362836-metaphor_refantazio_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the nearly five hours I spent with it, I found myself enamored with its characters, budding story, overall gameplay, and yes, its overarching metaphor. I was impressed by the way some of Atlus' most prolific developers had clearly utilized everything they've learned to create a sprawling fantasy that retains a sense of humanity, despite humans actually being grotesque monsters in the game's world. I have my hesitations--the main party doesn't seem quite as engaging as previous Atlus games and certain narrative elements feel a bit tired, having been used in several other fantasy games. Overall, however, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a game that left me wanting nothing more than to play another 60+ hours of it; it is easily the game I am most excited for this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">During the preview, I was able to play two separate sections of Metaphor: ReFantazio: an entirely new save file, which allowed me to see exactly how the game kicks off, and a save file approximately nine hours into the game--a glimpse into how its gameplay, systems, and story would eventually evolve.</p><p dir="ltr">The game begins with the protagonist--who, unlike Persona's heroes, is fully voiced--riding alongside a handful of strangers on a caravan headed to the Royal Capital. Within a minute of the game starting, however, the vehicle is attacked, ultimately separating him and his pixie-like companion Gallica from the group and forcing the pair to traverse the wastes outside the city on foot. It's here we learn a bit more about why the pair is headed to the capital; according to Gallica, we need to enlist in the royal military in order to find our confidant and deliver to him an important message. Naturally, a great deal more comes to light as the story progresses, such as the protagonist's seemingly reviled Elda lineage and his relationship to the current prince. More than anything, though, this shake-up serves as a way to introduce the player to exploration and combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat itself feels like a mix of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, combining the former's flashy combat and the latter's use of Player Actions during battles rather than a more fixed turn order. However, many things feel entirely fresh, giving Metaphor its own identity. One of the biggest changes is the game's real-time combat system, which grants players combat bonuses--such as reduced enemy health and first strike--if you successfully attack an enemy out on the field. We've seen a bit of this in the Persona and SMT series, as you can sneak up and attack an enemy to gain an advantage in battle, but it's a much larger part of Metaphor thanks to those perks and the fact that you can quickly eliminate weaker targets without having to enter turn-based combat. As you can imagine, this is a huge time (and frustration) saver. As the game lacks the same Baton Pass system as Persona 5 and enemies aren't always stunned when you exploit their weaknesses, attacking more fearsome foes out on the main map offers a new type of strategy unique to Metaphor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362840-metaphor_battle_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362840-metaphor_battle_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362840"></a><figcaption>The team fights a grotesque creature.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362840-metaphor_battle_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also new to Metaphor is the Archetype system, which, contrary to my initial belief, is not very similar to the Persona system. Rather than summons, Archetypes are essentially job classes that are unlocked both as the story progresses and as you increase your bonds with various characters; according to P-Studio, there will be around 40 to experiment with. And whereas Persona allows only your main character to shake up their skills--and permits them to do so mid-battle--all of Metaphor's party members are able to change classes, but can only do so outside of battle in a Velvet Room-like location referred to as Akademia. Something I particularly liked about this feature is that certain Archetypes offer strange advantages that don't solely correlate to "fire beats ice." For example, selecting the Merchant class and throwing money at a money-hungry enemy will stun it more effectively than an elemental attack. My only (shallow) disappointment with this was that changing Archetypes doesn't come with a cool outfit transformation a la Final Fantasy Tactics or Final Fantasy X-2, but I digress.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of combat, the similarities between Persona and Metaphor truly shine, as it features three familiar and beloved systems that cement the social-sim aspect of the game. Royal Virtues are the new Social Stats, while Followers are essentially the same thing as Social Links. Considering the game's main objective is to gain enough renown to become king, these systems feel completely at home, particularly the Followers portion. As you travel across the Kingdom of Euchronia, it is vital that you form connections not only to main characters, but to the general population of certain territories as well. For any fellow BioWare nerds out there, this system is reminiscent of Mass Effect 3's Galactic Readiness, as you can check in at towns and see if you remain in favor and are likely to get their vote for king.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet the most important system that Atlus chose to incorporate is the in-game calendar. The Metaphor: ReFantazio team has repeatedly said that fear and anxiety are two of the game's core themes; these are partially explored through the calendar system, which--even more so than the ones in the Persona games--does not allow for you to do everything. Instead, you will have to pick and choose which missions you embark on and which alliances you'll form. There <em>seems</em> to be no wrong way to go about things, but it will certainly spike anxiety in completionists who sought to max out every social link in the Persona games; it seems extremely likely that you won't get that luxury here and that multiple playthroughs will be required in order to see everything Metaphor has to offer.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the nice thing about this is your choices feel even more precious and rewarded. In the second part of the demo, I was given a great deal more freedom. Whereas some of the players around me darted straight toward the objective, I decided to go on a two-day journey down to a crypt, where an interesting boss battle and dark artifact awaited me. After doing this mission, I was able to form a new bond with a strange and shady character. It also gave me a better look at how dungeons will be structured and--thankfully--they differ from the largely procedurally generated ones found earlier Persona games or Mementos; according to the developers, each dungeon is uniquely designed, a choice they made to stress how important that aspect of the game is. Whereas Persona's dungeons can begin to feel like the necessary but exhausting filler that keeps you from your next objective, Metaphor's feel like worthwhile objectives in themselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362839-metaphor_royal_capital_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362839-metaphor_royal_capital_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362839"></a><figcaption>The protagonist hovers along the Royal Capital.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362839-metaphor_royal_capital_screenshot_1_png_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is all especially appealing given how wonderful Metaphor's world is to experience--I wanted to see what was out there. While large-scale traversal between cities and various points-of-interest is relegated to selecting a location on a larger map, the locations I visited were beautiful and, more importantly, felt alive as I explored them. I loved wandering around the old castle town of Martira, with its worn streets and dingy-yet-beautiful Bavarian homes. In the various alleys of the town, and around the fountain set right at the center of its square, I met disgruntled villagers, odd storytellers, haughty knights, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Although my time exploring Martira was brief, I still feel as if I got a grasp of the history and culture Atlus was aiming to convey, which is an impressive feat--especially considering P-Studio's previous titles. While many of the titles that the developers behind Metaphor: ReFantazio have worked on are set in real-world Japan, Metaphor's fantasy setting means they could no longer rely on a player's innate understanding of how the world looks and functions. This has its pros and cons; it's great to finally break free from real-world and high school settings and see what Atlus can do in a unique world, particularly visually. However, it did feel perhaps overly derivative at times. If you've played your fair share of fantasy JRPGs--Final Fantasy, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Trails, for example--some aspects of Metaphor feel familiar.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I absolutely loved the unique metanarrative the game is weaving, and how it boldly declares that video games and fantasy are both inspired by, and can inspire, the real world. Though some might dislike the notion, Metaphor is a deeply political game--and I don't say that merely because it's centered around an election. I've always admired how Atlus, in some ways, addresses social issues and is unafraid to have deep conversations with its players; the games often address abuse of power, prejudice, mental health, abuse, grief, love, and similar topics. In Metaphor, the team continues that tradition by drawing attention to how what media we consume impacts our beliefs. You can sense that video games aren't "just video games" to the team; they understand that stories hold power. That said, some of what the game tackles--most notably prejudice, militarism, and inequality--feel a bit superficial in this small portion I played; hopefully we'll see more complexity as the game progresses and its story will be elevated.</p><p dir="ltr">I also remain a bit hesitant-yet-hopeful regarding the game's characters. This is not because I didn't enjoy who I met, but because as of right now, the party feels a bit small and its members feel slightly one-note. The scene in which Strohl discovered his Archetype and rips an iron heart from his chest gave me chills--and cemented the just and noble (if not <em>slightly</em> arrogant) young man as a new husbando for myself. But so much of his personality and his backstory felt very similar to other fantasy archetypes; this was the case with the game's mentor-type character, Grius, as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362837-metaphor_character_screenshot_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362837-metaphor_character_screenshot_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362837"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's supporting cast of characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4362837-metaphor_character_screenshot_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Don't get me wrong: Atlus could very well be intentionally using fantasy tropes--the fact that it's jobs are called Archetypes would seem a great indicator that that's the case--but considering the studio is phenomenal at exploring relationships and creating interesting characters, I am hoping for more as I play on. There are several strong elements at play in Metaphor: ReFantazio--the character designs are interesting, the voice acting is wonderful, and the one-on-one interactions I had with my teammates on the Gauntlet Runner (the name of your party's vehicle/traveling home) felt tailored and special. In short, even if I can't romance any of my companions (womp womp), I just want to feel connected to them.</p><p dir="ltr">It feels almost unnecessary to dive into the game's art and music because Atlus always kills it. The characters retain that signature Atlus style, albeit with a fantasy twist. Monsters are still creative, demented, and at least a couple of them, phallic, and feel more or less in line with what the studio has done before, which is a good thing. It's interesting to note, though, that the fantasy element means we see more blood than we would in something like Persona; it took me by surprise at first but seems very natural and gives the game that darker tone.</p><p dir="ltr">Another interesting deviation is that while the Persona games feel very cohesive in regards to style--characters, UI, and many artistic features pull from a similar color palette, style, and overall "vibe," for lack of a better word--Metaphor relishes in juxtaposition. The darker tone of the game and the locations I walked through are given this fantastical whimsy thanks to its UI filled with pinks, teals, yellows, and more variety than the scarlet-soaked Persona 5 or black-and-blue Persona 3. It's an interesting mix-up and visually establishes Metaphor as its own series. The game's music similarly aids this, as it is unlike any of the poppier soundtracks the studio has created. Shoji Meguro, the lead composer behind Persona 3, 4, and 5, triumphs at creating a world that feels oppressive and regal through sound alone. Each track I heard was dramatic and intense, oftentimes featuring operatic voices crying out in Latin.</p><p dir="ltr">The greatest praise I can give in a preview is simply, "I did not want to stop playing it," and that is certainly the case with Metaphor: ReFantazio. I am eager to know these characters better, to understand how Euchronia connects to our world, to see how the game's themes of fear, oppression, and resistance play out, and to see the protagonist crowned king. Suffice to say, I am eagerly awaiting October 11, when Metaphor: ReFantazio releases on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Despite a noticeable lack of microtransactions available, it comes with most of the trappings of modern live-service games, including an excess of digital currencies--Gold, Moonstones and Winged Keys being the main ones. But while Gold and Moonstoones flow freely as you play, Winged Keys are a lot sparser, and it will take a while to earn enough of them to buy anything. But the task is hardly an impossible one--below, we'll break down how to get more Winged Keys as you play Quidditch Champions.</p><h2>How to get more Winged Keys in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</h2><p>Quidditch Champions is here, and it's got a lot of Harry Potter-themed cosmetics and skins that you can earn. And without microtransactions, you'll be able to unlock everything just by playing. You'll quickly find yourself with lots of Gold and Moonstones, but Winged Keys are few and far between. After my first several hours of playing Quidditch Champions, I'd earned enough Gold to buy the Hermione Granger skin from the Market, but I only had 20 Winged Keys--very far from the 250 needed to buy the Cedric Diggory, Cho Chang or Draco Malfoy skins from the Vault.</p><p>Gold and Moonstones are plentiful because you receive some every time you increase your career rank, which happens pretty rapidly. Winged Keys, on the other hand, are more of a grind. And there are two main sources of Winged Keys in Quidditch Champions: the free battle pass-esque Seasonal Rewards track, and daily and weekly challenges.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362833-4362769-harrypotterquidditchchampionsgryffindor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362833" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362833-4362769-harrypotterquidditchchampionsgryffindor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362833"></a><figcaption>Winged Keys can earn you some important items in Quidditch Champions.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362833-4362769-harrypotterquidditchchampionsgryffindor.jpg"></figure><p>The Seasonal Rewards come in the form of a free, 50-tier battle pass which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">features a variety of cosmetics including a Ron Weasley skin</a>. But about half the rewards on the pass are currencies, including 100 Winged Keys across those 50 tiers. But that's just the start of the grind--for every tier you gain past 50, you'll earn 10 additional Winged Keys. You'll earn some XP from playing matches, but the most efficient way is to complete challenges.</p><p>The challenges are small tasks that reward XP for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">battle pass</a> and/or Winged Keys. The current set of daily challenges offer seven Winged Keys in total, and completing every weekly challenge will grant you 41 Winged Keys. The dailies are simple jobs like playing five PvP matches or doing a shovel pass five times, and the weeklies are just longer versions of that same kind of thing.</p><p>Fortunately, you can do these challenges in the offline modes like the campaign as well as in multiplayer PvP, so if you need to get them done quickly you can do so by playing against the computer in Casual mode, which is the easiest difficulty option.</p><p>So if you're grinding for Winged Keys, the daily and weekly challenges are what you need to focus on--you'll get keys for the challenges themselves, and also from the seasonal rewards pass that you'll progress with the XP from the challenges.</p><p>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is developed by Unbroken Studios, and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is tangentially related to Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.

However, that initial October 2024 date shifted to January 2025.

Anyway, <em>totally </em>unrelated to that factoid, let’s take a look at the first reveal of the new Wolf Man’s design. </p><p>Over at Universal Studios Orlando, the park’s long-running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal%27s_Halloween_Horror_Nights&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal%27s_Halloween_Horror_Nights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween Horror Nights</a></span> event is in full swing. It’s there that the new look of the Wolf Man debuted recently, and the reaction hasn’t been great. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SpeculationMatt/status/1831461327048757433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SpeculationMatt/status/1831461327048757433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the Wolf Man via HHNSpeculationMatt</a></span>, a content creator who covers the spooky event.</p><p>Now, I don’t need to tell you, but this looks bad. The internet is having a field day with the new design, joking about how it doesn’t look like a werewolf and how it’s not very scary, either. </p><p>But a few things to keep in mind: One, this isn’t the actual outfit or costume that will be used in the upcoming film. That movie will likely use a mix of CG and more expensive practical makeup to create its scary werewolf. Two, this might be a version of the character that we see in the movie, but not the final or only form. </p><p>Still, even if we assume the final version will look better, this design doesn’t look much like a wolf. It looks more like a cranky old goblin. Personally, if I was running the ship over at Universal and Blumhouse, I’d be scrambling right now to get a Wolf Man trailer out the door that shows off a better-looking version of the iconic monster.

I hope the werewolf looks better than this Halloween Horror Nights version. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
