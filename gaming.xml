			<p>Today, Bungie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a small video developer update for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming extraction shooter</a> based on the sci-fi Marathon IP. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Game Director</a> Joe Ziegler (who previously worked on The Saboteur at Pandemic and Valorant at Riot) talked a bit about how the game is going to work:</p>
<p><em>We give you a lot of different tools to do a lot of different things inside the game. There is a ton of loot that you can find: weapons, equipment that you can equip that changes your stats or tweaks some of the things that you can do inside the game. There are utility consumables akin to mines or grenades, and there are even consumables to heal yourself and give you utility in that way.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, there is also another layer: Runners. They are the template by which you equip all that stuff to. Each Runner has a small subset of abilities and on top of that, you get to customize however you want, thinking about what you want to accomplish. You might equip different types of gear to your Runner and then go on those runs with that gear in mind.</em></p>
<p><em>There's a lot of different ways a Marathon session can unfold with all those different pieces. There are also many objectives and things like that that exist inside the game. But of course, every single one comes with its own risk. And the risk is always present that if you don't get out alive, you will lose the things that you have on you.</em></p>
<p>In the latter half of the video, Ziegler said that Bungie has collaborated with some players and creators to iterate on the game over the past two years. Next year, fans can expect to learn a lot more about the game toward the middle of the year, likely during the regular May PlayStation Showcase. In 2025, Marathon will also greatly expand its player testing with each new milestone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282075/fortnite-streamlining-battle-passes-music-lego-festival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">bigger than a battle royale now</a>, and to help make progressing through the various available battle passes a little bit more streamlined, Epic Games is going to allow XP from any experience apply to any of those passes.</p><p>Currently, XP you earn across various modes in <em>Fortnite</em> doesn’t help you progress through the special passes for <em>Lego Fortnite</em> and the music-themed <em>Fortnite Festival.</em> Instead, you progress by earning “studs” and “festival points,” respectively, by playing those modes.</p><p>Starting November 2nd, however, Epic will begin the migration to let you progress using XP. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience">As Epic details in a blog post</a>, the change will first apply the upcoming Music Pass (renamed from Festival Pass), meaning festival points will go away. On December 1st, the change to XP will go into effect for the “Brick or Treat” Lego Pass and studs will be retired. That same day, the “battle stars” that you earn with XP in <em>Fortnite’s</em> main battle pass will also be removed.</p><p>Epic is continuing to make <em>Fortnite</em> more of a platform with lots of Epic- and creator-made experiences rather than just one main mode. Letting players use XP to all of its various players helps address some growing pains with that transition — especially now that Epic has had about a year since the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993494/catch-some-air"><em>Rocket Racing</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23756615"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a><em> </em>to figure out what players want.</p><p>There are a few more changes coming, too. Music and LEGO Passes that release after December 1st will offer one track that has both free rewards and premium rewards exclusive to people who buy them, like how the main <em>Fortnite </em>battle pass works. Epic will let users directly buy a reward on a pass that they might want, meaning they won’t have to grind levels just to get it (or buy the necessary levels to reach that point). And while the battle pass, Lego Pass, and Music Pass are currently all separate purchases, Epic is promising that it will “soon” offer a way to buy all of them at once.</p><p>The battle pass changes are being announced just days before the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom">current Marvel-themed season</a>, which is set to end on Saturday at 2AM ET. Epic is <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1850962301337133455">already teasing</a> a new live event and that the next season, “Remix,” will return to the Chapter 2 island, meaning we’ll probably get another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23943701/fortnite-og-new-season-tilted-towers-baller">“OG”-like trip through the game’s history</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>So we'll have more formal details on this ASAP, but the short version is that we're going to be getting together in person in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=872_7q9tqxw&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">New York City</a> next week for another in-person stream. Nearly three full days of streaming across Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And all for a good cause, because we're bringing back Save Point. It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of things are coming together last minute, but as soon as a few of those things work out, I promise we'll have more concrete info. </p><p>-pk, who scheduled his flight back home just in time for football</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview (Home Depot's Skeleton Daddy)</em> – Well, this is it. The big time. I'm so glad I managed to get this interview before I turn 40 next year, because it means I haven't wasted the last four decades. I haven't been able to record as many interviews as I would've liked in recent months, but look, sometimes you make up for all of it in one go. Hope you enjoy this!</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Space Marine 2</em> – We'll probably play a few hours of<em> Space Marine 2 </em>at the live show, too, but we're going to dip our toes back into our favorite co-op game that we love to complain about at the end because of the gear grind.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommend</em>s – OK, I'm excited about this one. The idea of a "staff picks" article came up some weeks back and it hasn't left my head, so we're going to pilot a new regular series where, every month, we recommend a game that's lingered in our minds and hearts as the month ends. (Yes, I still want to do a proper Steam Curator thing, too. Stay tuned.) I think there's a possibility we do one that involves what we're watching/listening/reading, too.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Horror Games</em> – We're still figuring out the <em>what</em> part of this stream, but basically Rob, Patrick, and Cado are gonna get together and get a lil' spooky. Because of my family Halloween obligations, I won't have time to do another nighttime horror stream, but I promise we'll get back to that again.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Janet has finished the new<em> Life Is Strange,</em> and according to the review she wrote, uh, it does not finish well. Welp. No thoughts on the new <em>Dragon Age</em> just yet, but I'm going to start it this week.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Rob &amp; Patrick's Letter Series </em>– Still figuring out the topic for this one, because we tend to write it as the week goes on, but we'll have somethin'.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954">reviewed it here at <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>, and despite being jaded toward the series for the better part of a decade, I really loved the long-awaited fourth entry. Right now it sits at a strong 84 on review aggregate site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a></span>, which is about in line with where these games typically land. The original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> sits at an 86, with <em>Inquisition</em>, the series’ third entry, landing close by at 84. Meanwhile, <em>Dragon Age II</em>, probably the most divisive game in the series, sits at 79. As much as I loved my time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, I knew it would elicit some pretty divergent reactions from folks. There are 10s and there are some more middling scores. You can even find some folks straight-up saying they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“do not recommend”</a></span> the game, like YouTuber Skill Up does while discussing all his problems with BioWare’s latest entry.

I loved the games when they came out, then replayed them all for a book club-style podcast I do and soured on them all in their own ways over time, largely due to the series’ handling of continuity and its tendency to hand off protagonists’ stories from one to another. <em>The Veilguard </em>pulled me back in when I could not have been more out. The story was a slow burn, but I was genuinely thrilled by its finale. The new cast of heroes won me over pretty easily and ascended to the upper echelons of my own personal rankings of BioWare’s RPG casts. And though it deviates greatly from the series’ tactical roots, I found the action-based combat a blast to play and experiment with. Overall, it’s a game that feels like it harkens to the studio’s heyday, and is a reminder of what it does best.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span> sits at the bottom of the Metacritic spread and came to pretty much the opposite conclusions I did on some of those points, in part because what I viewed as a calculated “back to basics” moment for the team felt, to their critic, somewhat archaic.</p><p>“Within the modern action RPG space, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> feels fine,” reviewer Jordan Middler wrote. “It’s a game that is never overtly bad, but it’s also only ever very fleetingly amazing. We particularly enjoyed its cast, but the majority of things you’re asked to do with them are disappointingly repetitive. There are moments of spectacle, and longer main missions that show potential, but overall we were left feeling like BioWare hasn’t evolved with the times.”</p><p>Though I adored the members of the titular Veilguard, others didn’t find the new characters quite so endearing, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sports Illustrated</em></a></span><em> </em>drawing a critical parallel to the writing in the MCU.</p><p>“A lot of the dialogue in <em>Veilguard</em> has that same, sarcastic, quippy tone of the Marvel movies,” Kirk McKeand wrote. “It’s like someone crunching an ice pop in your ear. There are rare moments where excellent writing reaches through the screen and makes you consider your mortality, but it’s inconsistent. Compelling conversations about religion, history, and the interpretations of both are juxtaposed against voice lines where people say things like “watch out, these guys GO HARD”, “were they… doing it?”, or “taking the p*ss”. It pulls you right out of the fantasy setting. These characters definitely know what TikTok is.”</p><p>There’s been a lot of pre-release discussion around whether or not <em>The Veilguard </em>feels “like a <em>Dragon Age</em> game.” Skill Up’s video touches on this in the most damning review I’ve seen thus far. It starts off going real hard on <em>The Veilguard</em>’s tone, saying it doesn’t match the same dark tone some have come to expect in previous games, while also just broadly saying the writing is not up to snuff.</p><p>“The writing is, frankly, terminal.” Skill Up says. “It lacks any nuance or wit or wisdom. It cannot communicate ideas except to say them aloud to the camera. It manufactures petty, unbelievable tension because it doesn’t know how to create anything more real and it’s too scared to ever be truly confronting or dark for fear that it might make the audience uncomfortable. Every interaction between the companions feels like HR is in the room and every interaction led by the main character Rook sounds like he’s addressing an under-12 soccer team before a semi-final or teaching toddlers how to properly share toys.”</p><p>Ouch. By contrast, while I wouldn’t defend every line BioWare wrote, as I do think there’s some merit to the MCU comparison, I didn’t feel like the game was compromising on the series’ typical dark fantasy trappings. Sure, the world doesn’t look as gnarly as it did back in <em>Origins</em> because <em>The Veilguard</em> presents it in a more Pixar-esque art style (and with cinematography to match), but there’s still some high stakes and some pretty horrifying lore drops in stories like that of Davrin, the Grey Warden who discovers hidden truths in the faction’s history, or in the big reveals tied to Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em> party-member turned antagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>But what about the folks on the higher end of the scale? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span><em> </em>gave <em>The Veilguard </em>a whopping five stars out of five. While the pivot to action RPG combat has been a contentious point for those who want to see the series return to its tactical roots, it’s landing for folks who want something more evocative of BioWare’s <em>Mass Effect</em>.</p><p>“...there’s a lot more other stuff going on in <em>The Veilguard</em> combat than has been in <em>Dragon Age</em> games before,” Robert Purchese wrote. “It’s an action game, really, a boundary the series has been pushing towards but never quite passed, always emotionally shackled, as it was, by its CRPG roots. But now it’s stepped over, taking <em>Mass Effect</em>’s lead as an example, and it’s discovered something new and very successful as a result.”</p><p>Another controversial decision that the game’s developers made is just how it implements choice and consequence. Impactful choices have been a big part of BioWare’s portfolio over the years, and when it was confirmed that <em>The Veilguard </em>would only import three choices from previous games (all of which are from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>), there was a fear that the game would feel detached from the past. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em>’s</a></span> 9/10 review touches on this, saying <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like a soft reboot of sorts, even as it includes the protagonist from the previous game and a conflict that should, in theory, feature them frequently.</p><p>“If you were expecting decisions from previous games in the series to carry over, I’m sorry to say they’ve never mattered less,” Leana Hafer wrote. “[...] things like who you chose to make head of the Chantry at the end of <em>Inquisition</em> never come up. There’s no sign of the Warden from <em>Origins</em>, even though you visit the stronghold of their order. Hawke gets only a passing mention. There are some other cameos from both <em>Origins</em> and <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, but those characters conspicuously don’t reference any important choices you may have made in their presence. This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot, in a way, which was paradoxically a bit refreshing and disappointing at the same time.”</p><p>I was of two minds on this in my review. Over the years, I think I’ve learned it’s more important to me that my old choices are not contradicted in future games, rather than that they have some huge effect on the events of sequels. Given that BioWare wasn’t going to do all the admittedly costly and time-consuming work of reflecting your many choices from earlier games in this one, seeing them carefully write around the past was preferable to them making a definitive call about those events that may have contradicted my experience. <em>The Veilguard</em> takes place in lands far removed from those old choices, so it makes some sense that it wouldn’t be constantly referencing the past. However, I couldn’t get behind <em>The Veilguard</em>’s portrayal of the previous game’s protagonist, the Inquisitor, in their brief appearances.</p><p>“Perhaps the Inquisitor’s minimal presence gave me the space to grow attached to Rook and fill in how he would be different from my last <em>Dragon Age</em> character,” I said in <em>Kotaku</em>’s review. “But every time I met up with the Inquisitor, I was reminded that the character who, ten years ago, I imagined would be facing Solas was just a puppet dragged out of a closet, a half-assed fulfillment of an obligation BioWare seems unwilling to completely make good on.”</p><p>While the decision to only have a few choices carry over is iffy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar+</em></a></span><em> </em>argues that as a whole, <em>The Veilguard </em>manages to be comprehensible to newcomers through clarity in its writing, while also catering to long-time fans by delivering on so many major mysteries they’ve been pondering for over a decade.</p><p>“<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is about as approachable as it can be for both new players and those that have previously thanked the Maker,” Rollin Bishop wrote. “Appropriate context is given when proper nouns are brought up, going some way to avoid being impenetrable and making it as fine a point of entry as any to dive into. But it also answers many questions that longtime players have had over the years… while introducing even more tantalizing hints at what might come next. My only hope is that we don’t have to wait another 10 years to find out more.”</p><p>From the sound of it, where you’ll land on <em>The Veilguard </em>largely seems to depend on what you come to it looking for. Its action slant has impressed some, while others are still jonesing for a tactical game like <em>Origins</em>. If you want a continuation of your choices from old games you might be disappointed, but if you want a conclusion to years-long threads, <em>The Veilguard </em>offers those in spades. There are a lot of little nuances that might tip a prospective player to one side or the other, or you might just find yourself falling somewhere in the middle like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VG24/7</em></a></span>, who acknowledged that the ways in which people have diverged will make <em>The Veilguard </em>an interesting game to talk about.</p><p>“I expect the divided discourse to be as interesting as - and more varied than - the game,” Alex Donaldson wrote. “One thing that I think is inarguable, though, is that it showcases a BioWare on steadier feet than at any point in the last decade. Where that firmer stance has been planted just means one’s mileage really is going to vary more than the norm, depending on your predilections and tolerances.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Throw your lethal equipment into the water where you see a splash to kill a fish. Cooked grenades, semtex, and shock charges all work here. You can do this anywhere there's water, so it doesn't have to be at the Bio Lab. It's just more convenient.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Grab a dead fish</strong>. This part can be confusing, because it doesn't highlight or tell you that it's an item you can pick up. The fish won't even disappear like you collected it, but you should have one if you interact with it.</p><p dir="ltr">Now you have all the ingredients needed to cook.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Cook up a special dish</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391715-cookingfishinpan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391715" data-ratio="0.55747663551402" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391715-cookingfishinpan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391715"></a><figcaption>Cooking fish in the pan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391715-cookingfishinpan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Head back to Mess Hall. Interact with the cooking pan on the stove. This lets you add all the ingredients to the pan one by one:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Cooking oil</li><li dir="ltr">Fish</li><li dir="ltr">Battery</li><li dir="ltr">Salt</li><li dir="ltr">Brain</li><li dir="ltr">Can of chili</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Note: The trophy doesn't specify which items to use. The combined ingredients seems to be the salt, cooking oil, brain, and the battery, plus one other special ingredient. I've heard some people used eggplant instead of chili, but this is what worked for me.</p><p dir="ltr">The Culinary Delight trophy/achievement may not pop until you advance to the next round.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies also features a supervillain-themed Easter egg on Liberty Falls that will reward you with another hidden achievement for Black Ops 6.

You can use this Aetherella statue as a trap for killing zombies, which beams them with laser eyes like Homelander from The Boys.</p><p dir="ltr">Aetherella also has nine action figures hidden around the map, and collecting them all will temporarily transform into the villain to use her superpower against the horde. This will also earn you the Black Ops 6 trophy/achievement called World Domination.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Craft a Jetgun Wonder Weapon</h3><p dir="ltr">To start this side Easter egg, you'll first need to get your hands on the map's Wonder Weapon.

Alternatively, you can also get lucky and get the Jetgun from the Mystery Box, but your chances are slim.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Collect all nine Aetherella action figures</h3><p dir="ltr">Using the Jetgun's sucking mechanic, you'll be able to reach Aetherella's out-of-reach action figures. <strong>These can be collected in any order</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391694-figuremotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391694" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391694-figuremotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391694"></a><figcaption>Figure on motel sign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391694-figuremotel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One figure is found on top of the motel sign that's mounted to the right side of the building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391695-figurebowling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391695" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391695-figurebowling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391695"></a><figcaption>On top of the bowling alley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391695-figurebowling.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another is found on top of the bowling alley.

Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio has released a gameplay free developer update saying the game is "on track" albeit "little early to show" - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" next year.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE">nine-minute developer video</a> presented by Marathon game director Joe Ziegler, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">took over the role</a> from former project lead Chris Barrett earlier this year, after the latter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">reportedly ousted from Bungie due to inappropriate behaviour</a>.
</p>
<p>
In his update, Ziegler began with a brief overview of Bungie's Marathon reboot, outlining the extraction shooter's basic loop (complete quests, find loot to upgrade abilities, then get it out of the extraction zone to keep it) alongside a few other gameplay details. Playable Runners, for instance, are each said to have a "small subset" of abilities that can be further customised with gear, depending on what players want to achieve. That's alongside promises of "lots of tools, "lots of objectives" and lots of ways an individual run can unfold.

<p>
Ziegler also touched on Marathon's connection to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Bungie's 90s sci-fi shooter series of the same name</a>, saying the reboot uses a lot of "familiar elements" from the original - including the "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness" - then layers on elements that help "modernise" it, including a new story and world Bungie can continue to update.
</p><p>
In terms of progress, Zeigler explained there'd been a "lot of aggressive changes to the game" over the last few years, and that Bungie has been "iterating pretty heavily". As such, there are a "variety of different things in different states" right now; environments, for instance, are said to be "coming together in a really beautiful way", while character models are "coming together but not fully there yet", and enemy models are still "kind of a little bit in an early state".
</p>
<p>
"It's a little early to show you all of it as one piece," Ziegler said, "but all of these things are on-track. They're not all together but when they all do come together, we really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like, especially in play." But while Bungie isn't yet ready to show any gameplay, Ziegler did share a couple of bits of concept art, one showing a Runner with the codename Thief, and another "deception' based character called Stealth.
</p>

<p>
And while Bungie has nothing else to show right now, it plans to "reveal a lot more... in the midst of 2025". Next year will also see the studio expand its playtesting, with Ziegler revealing the team wants to add a "significant amount of players to each of our milestones as we're going forward". The studio will let the community know "when that happens".
</p><p>
"The interest that you've shown engaging with all the content we've created... really fuels us on a daily basis," Ziegler concluded in his video update. "We're excited to engage with you more in 2025 and beyond as we bring this game to all of you to play."
</p>
<p>
Today's update is the first time Bungie has talked about Marathon in any real detail since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">unveiling the project in 2023</a>, and the first promotional push since the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - back in July.

Though Blizzard has released several variations of its annual spooky event, the original Junkenstein’s Revenge was one of the earliest examples of the potential lurking beneath the competitive surface. It has such a good concept: Reinhardt gathering folks around for a spooky story starring alternate versions of <em>Overwatch</em> heroes in a fight to survive the night. The vibes are immaculate, the actual event is a blast to play with friends, and Blizzard has rolled out some reasonably challenging spins on it over the years. Just don’t think about it too hard or you’ll remember this game was supposed to have a PvE story mode. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-recommend-id="image://619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-recommend-id="image://619d50318bd259fad9ffeb52e288df5c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Dates: </strong>October 8 through November 5<br></p><p>Halo Infinite is still around and going strong.

<p>Competitive Call of Duty is being kicked off early in Black Ops 6, but it’s not being backed by Activision.</p>



<p>ZooMaa’s ‘The Flank’ has announced a triple-threat of tournaments that’ll take place between October 29 and November 6, and as a collective, they boast a $100,000 prize pool. It’s a CDL AR &amp; SMG spree that boasts 12 teams made up of four players each, and it comes before the 2025 CDL season has even been formally announced.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-our-own-hands">Into Our Own Hands</h2>



<p>From the moment Black Ops 6 was released, the more competitive players among us were looking for an angle from which they could earn. Wagers sprung up, $8s started running rampant on social media, and amateur kick-off tournaments were set up far and wide.</p>



<p>This is by far the biggest Black Ops 6 tournament to surface, and it comes mere days after the game was released.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Flank has revealed the following schedule:</p>



<ul>
<li>October 29 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 1 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 5/6 – $50,000 tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>On tonight’s episode of The Flank, the teams are being picked live, and the expectation is that it’ll be mostly CDL and Challengers players that make the cut, with a few Warzone competitors sprinkled in as cannon fodder.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan – the off-season and pre-season events hosted by brands like OpTic and The Flank are typically more entertaining than the official CDL events. Don’t tell Activision I said that, though.</p>



<p>Will you be checking out the first major Black Ops tournament on October 29? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The best defense in the game is a good offense, and as a Primaris Space Marine, there's a gratifying amount of ultra-violence here as you carve a bloody path through the Tyranid hordes. The game looks good, feels consistently fun to play, and it has robust PvP and PvE modes to sample after the end credits have rolled on its meaty campaign.</p><p>"Space Marine 2 is a fantastic sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, bombarding you with an overwhelming enemy and chaotic action that makes you feel like a small part of a much larger war," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a>.</p><p>PC gamers aren't being left out in the cold either, as Space Marine 2 continues to be available for a discounted price at GameSpot sister site Fanatical.

			<p>Those who are signed up as an Xbox Insider will now have the opportunity to experience the new Windows Home experience in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/">Xbox app</a>. It features a lot of changes and brings forward a new design that shows off the top games on Game Pass and Store tabs, as well as providing you with new games, news, and curated recommendations. For those who may not be able to splurge on new games, it also shows off free-to-play content for those looking for a new experience and game to play but don't want to sink any money into it.</p>
<p>This new experience comes after months of listening to feedback and trying out different designs internally. They have made this new Windows Home experience for Xbox Insiders to test out, hoping to make a faster and easier Xbox app on Windows, allowing those who utilize it to jump between Game Pass and Microsoft Store with ease and without having to flip between tabs constantly.</p>
<p>Walking through the highlights of the new Home experience, the main part is the featured content. This provides an at-a-glance view of upcoming game releases, events, and content that is available via Game Pass and sales. Alongside this, you'll be able to get the latest deals and discounts available to peruse, showing you the best deals and discounts on offer so that you don't have to pay full price for games and new experiences.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will now be curated collections and recommendations for you based on what games you've played previously. The games shown to you will include games from both Game Pass and the Store, depending on which way you prefer to access your games.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also added a 'Jump Back In' feature as part of the Game Pass tab experience. This features allows players in Compact Mode to click on a game card and will send them directly to the game hub, where you can press play and jump back into the game seamlessly. This feature has been in testing since May, and is now available as part of the new Home experience for all Xbox Insiders.</p>
<p>While it isn't widely available for those who aren't Xbox Insiders at the moment, you can join the Xbox Insider Program by downloading the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Insider Hub</a>, which will give you access to new features and previews that Microsoft are working on to improve the Xbox experience.</p>

<p>Popular lifestyle and gaming organization, 100 Thieves, revealed a brand-new Adidas Merch line, which is set to drop this November. The drop, which includes shoes, sweatshirts and more, is another perfect example of how very few gaming organizations are doing it like 100 Thieves.</p>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-x-adidas-merch-release-date">100 Thieves x Adidas Merch Release Date</h2>



<p>The new merch by Adidas and 100 Thieves is currently set to release on the following date:</p>



<ul>
<li>November 6, 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those looking to purchase the drop can do so at the official <a href="https://t.co/lud7N2Kfep">Adidas website</a> and select retailers. However, 100 Thieves fans will be able to get early access to the new merch at <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves’s website</a> on November 2, 2024.</p>



<p>100 Thieves has been dedicated to providing gamers with sleek-designed merch for years now in hopes of combining both lifestyle clothing and gaming.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-report-100-thieves-to-build-cdl-superteam-based-on-scrap-and-hydra">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/">REPORT: 100 Thieves To Build CDL ‘Superteam’ Based on Scrap and HyDra</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-the-merch-drop">Everything Included in the Merch Drop</h2>



<p>The 100 Thieves x Adidas merch drop marks the second time the two brands have worked together. The drop is being called the Adidas Originals x 100 Thieves Drop 02 and will feature the following clothing items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Long Sleeve Shirt</li>



<li>Jacket</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Socks</li>
</ul>



<p>The entire drop fits well together, featuring a black, white and red design pattern. </p>



<p>Here is a gallery of pictures included on the official 100 Thieves website from the merch drop:</p>

<p>It has become quite common for large brands, such as Adidas, to work with gaming companies and organizations. 100 Thieves, however, continues to put out merch like no other.</p>



<p>Will you be purchasing any of the upcoming 100 Thieves merch? While prices have not been revealed, it will more than likely be a bit more on the expensive end.</p>

They plan to be gaming the rest of their lives so decided it would "save a good bit of money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A PS Plus Essential subscription cost $79.99 per year, so 24 years worth costs $1,919.76. Then, Sony was kind enough to offer the player an 89% discount to upgrade to a Premium subscription in a bizarre loophole, charging just $199.99 instead of $1,889.75, meaning it came to $2,119.75 altogether,</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS Plus Games (Extra &amp; Premium Tiers)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the reaction to On_Reddit_In_Class's post was a mixture of shock and awe, there is at least some logic behind the move, assuming PlayStation Plus remains a thing into the mid 21st century. Subscription service prices are on the rise, with everything from PS Plus to Xbox Game Pass and Netflix going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-raises-price-of-playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-across-all-tiers">Sony last raised the price of PS Plus in September 2023</a>, from $59.99 to $79.99 for the most basic tier. "This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service," it said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-defends-ps-plus-price-rises">Analysts said this was inevitable</a>, so another increase in the future isn't out of the question. Xbox Game Pass has seen a similar price rise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">doubling from $9.99 at its launch in 2017 to $19.99 now</a>. Buying a subscription ahead of time guarantees the price remains the same, however, so On_Reddit_In_Class may be on to something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

They’ll position themselves facing an oncoming horde of bugs, then make quick work of their enemies with rapid-firing, bolt-slinging rifles that shouldn’t be this effective on an extraterrestrial world, and yet here we are. It’s safe to say that people love the Constitution. I will say that, while you can certainly challenge yourself, consider bringing a different weapon for eradication missions.<br></p><p>It’s not entirely useless, though.

                <p>Older console maintenance is a must-do habit for collectors to keep on playing their favorite games. From more difficult tasks like soddering in circuits to exponentially easier ones like replacing a battery, it's all part of keeping consoles up and running. The latter though, is something becoming more prominent over the last few years, especially with portable consoles using lithium batteries.</p><p>Earlier in October, some <a href="https://x.com/violetokami_/status/1849030351152148787" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter users found out</a> that lithium batteries tend to swell up after a few years, potentially causing serious trouble. Now, this is not the first time this sort of incident has come up. The Playstation Vita had a similar situation, and even people reported PSP <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/psdk76/dug_my_psp_1000_out_of_storage_is_this_a_swollen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">issues a few years ago</a>.</p><p>"If you own any lipo battery I recommend buying yourself a lipo safe bag that is fire and explosion proof. I own a few of these and you never know when your batteries will burst due to swelling," one poster <a href="https://x.com/CyberJoules/status/1849459869146910910" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suggested</a>. "You may just save your home from a fire or worse by spending an extra $15-$20."</p><p>So while some gamers might be experiencing this for the first time, it's hardly some new or sudden threat. This is a wise practice to periodically follow as your devices continue to age. When you notice it, it's not always an immediate threat, but something to make sure gets replaced.</p><p>"Swelling certainly isn't good, and it's an indicator of decreased performance," said David Mitlin, a battery researcher and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/18/lithium-ion-battery-swelling-why/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> about the subject. "But it doesn't instantly mean the battery is going to catch on fire."</p><p>The condition is caused by the gases created lithium ions flow from one end to the other, moving in the opposite direction when the battery is being used to power something. Those ions move through something called the electrolyte. As you keep charging and discharging the battery over time, the electrolyte begins to decompose and produce gases as a byproduct.</p><p>Mitlin continued with the fact that that not all rechargeable batteries are equal. Some big name companies invest even bigger money into researching and developing batteries that stall this decay. In the meantime, there are a few things to keep an eye on such as if the battery gets too hot and what the charge percentage is.</p>

        <p>Changes begin this weekend.</p>

            <p>
Epic has <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">announced</a> an overhaul of its different mode-specific <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> passes that'll soon make it possible to progress through each one simultaneously, regardless of the mode players are currently playing in - and that's on top of word the company readying to introduce an "easy way to snag all premium passes at once".
</p>
<p>
As things stand at present, players can progress through Fortnite's Battle Royale Battle Pass by earning XP from any in-game experience, but the Festival Pass and LEGO Pass can only be levelled by playing in their respective modes (that is, Fortnite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>). However, that's all set to change starting on 2nd November.
</p>
<p>
From that date, all earned XP, regardless of the mode it was generated in, will progress the Battle Pass and Music Pass (the new name for the Festival Pass) simultaneously. Then, from 1st December, the changes will apply to the LEGO Pass too. As part of this overhaul, the Music and LEGO Pass will change to a format resembling the Battle Pass, meaning one track containing both free and premium rewards for each - although this won't come into effect until the current Lego Pass and Music Pass have run their course.

<p>
To accommodate these changes, Epic is ditching Festival Points (from 2nd November) alongside Battle Stars and Studs (from 1st December), so that the only earnable currency required to unlock tiers across each pass is XP. It'll be possible to claim rewards in non-sequential order on all unlocked pages of each pass, as is currently the case with the Battle Pass, and players can configure their passes to auto-unlock rewards as XP is earned. Furthermore, players will be able to directly purchase pass rewards (up to an unspecified limit) if they want something they haven't managed to unlock yet.
</p><p>
Epic notes players will still need to purchase the Battle Pass, Music Pass, and LEGO Pass separately if they want to unlock each pass' premium rewards, but teases that an "easy way to snag all premium passes at once" will be introduced soon. There's no word on how this will work - or if, say, Epic will offer a bundle discount for players who want passes across all three modes - but it shouldn't be long until we hear more.
</p>
<p>
"We hope this change encourages you to play where you want, how you want!," Epic concludes. "Soon it’ll be even easier to unlock awesome rewards in Fortnite."
</p>
<p>
Word that Fortnite's pass changes come into effect this Saturday, 2nd November, lends credence to unconfirmed reports Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix will launch on the same date. This mini-season is expected to follow the same format as last year's hugely popular Chapter 1 Remix, which - as its name suggests - brought back elements of Fortnite's inaugural chapter for some nostalgia-baiting fun. Although details are thin, Chapter 2 Remix will likely include numerous map options alongside the return of Midas, Meowscles, TNTina, Slurp Commando Ripley, and 8-Ball (possibly now 1-Ball), as you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">read about elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

Instead,  Bungie’s new sci-fi extraction shooter was delayed until 2025 and still hasn’t reemerged with new gameplay since its initial PlayStation Showcase reveal. At least now, however, we do have a new development update from the project’s game director, Joe Ziegler. It details what fans can expect from the bold reboot, including “harsh” survival mechanics that might not be for everybody, but is surprisingly light on information about a game expected to arrive in just a year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE&amp;t=4s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE&amp;t=4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new YouTube video</a></span> outlines the core mechanics and game loop that players will hopefully be diving into sometime in the not-too-distant future. The core gameplay revolves around customizing characters called runners that players take into matches, collecting loot and fending off rivals in order to escape alive lest they lose everything they earned during the outing. If you’ve played <em>Escape From Tarkov </em>or <em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, you probably already know the drill. </p><p>“It’s a game that’s not for everybody, but if you are interested in having sort of that tense survival experience and having a game where the stakes really matter and you’re challenged to survive in a really, really harsh and interesting world, then <em>Marathon</em>’s right up your alley,” Ziegler said. He added that the world of <em>Marathon</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109">which is based on Bungie’s classic 1990s sci-fi trilogy that recently re-released on Steam</a></span>, will evolve as fans play so that there are new things for them to learn and discover. </p><figure id="" data-id="305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-recommend-id="image://305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-recommend-id="image://305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So far, that’s all old news. What we did get from Ziegler for the first time was a glimpse of a couple of Runner archetypes codenamed “Thief” and “Stealth.” What exactly they’ll do remains a mystery, but the concept art, as with everything else in the game, looks really neat. He also gave a very light update on the state of development, including that environments are “coming together” really well while character models are not “completely there yet” and  enemy models are still in an early state. “It’s a little early to show you all of it as one piece,” Ziegler said, which isn’t exactly reassuring for a game players expected to see at the recent PlayStation State of Play in September.</p><p><em>Marathon</em>’s big delay came a year ago amid the first round of seismic cuts at Bungie following its acquisition by Sony.  Ziegler, who previously worked on <em>Valorant</em> at Riot Games, was announced as the new game director earlier this year, with it only being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported later by <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> that previous director and longtime Bungie veteran Chris Barrett had been fired for misconduct. Rumors of a $40 price point and new playtests have taken hold in the meantime, with questions about whether <em>Marathon</em> is actually really on track yet or not still up in the air. </p><p> “For the past couple of years we’ve been doing a lot of aggressive change to the game and we’ve been iterating pretty heavily,” Ziegler said today. That certainly paints a picture of a game very much still in the middle of development. Perhaps instead of a cold launch in 2025, there will be a series of closed and open betas to get player feedback and grow a fan community around the game instead. <em>Concord</em>’s recent failure may have put new pressure on the live-service prospects of <em>Marathon</em>, as well as <em>Destiny 2</em>'s evolving future. Ziegler signed off his video by asking players to Wishlist the game on the PlayStation store so they know how interested everyone is.</p><p>You can watch the full video below:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You'll need to hop from the nearby rooftop to the top of the truck that's parked outside of the shop. This lets you vacuum the part out of the top-right window of the barbershop.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Build the LTG device</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660"></a><figcaption>Build the LTG on bank rooftop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With all three LTG parts collected, you can now head to the bank's rooftop. Just unlock and use either the zipline or ascender connected to the roof. There is a special crafting bench on the roof just for this device.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the LTG device</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Grab an Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Head back into the church after building the LTG. Interact with the machine again to <strong>pick up an Aether canister</strong>. Whoever holds this item is going to be weighed down and moving slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">Take the canister to either of the two Dark Aether storms on the map. There's one at the Cemetery and another just right of the Pump and Pay gas station. The order doesn't matter here, but we'll start the guide at the gas station.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Collect an HVT essence</h3><p dir="ltr">Place your canister near the trap at the gas station. Then, interact with the trap piece located directly under the purple storm. Doing so will place the LTG device down.</p><p dir="ltr">This will spawn zombies for a 60-second window. You need to protect the device from taking damage from zombies during this time. Then, the device will turn red, and a portal will spawn the HVT. This enemy will be either a Mangler or an Abomination.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661" data-ratio="0.56214953271028" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661"></a><figcaption>Mangler HVT at the gas station trap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You <strong>need to weaken but not kill</strong> the HVT right away. Get the health low and lead the HVT back to the canister you placed down near the trap. The HVT emits purple sparks when the health gets low enough. When this happens, you need to quickly activate the trap. You need to <strong>kill the HVT by the canister while the trap is still active</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HVT's essence now captured in the trap, you must collect that canister and carry it back to the church. <strong>This step is timed</strong> at 90 seconds, plus you still move slowly carrying it, so make haste toward the church.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Deposit the filled Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Deposit this canister back into the machine inside the church. Once the canister is deposited, a tray on the machine will dispense a new item to pick up. This is called a Strauss Counter. Grab it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the Strauss Counter</h2><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter is used to sync up three items on the map that look like old-school film projectors. Using the Strauss Counter is the same button prompt as activating your tactical equipment, and you'll want to activate it while standing beside each of these small devices.</p><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter will give you a color, which can be green, yellow, or red. Interact with the projector device on the ground until it matches the color shown on your Strauss Counter. Repeat this step for all three devices. These are found as follows:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662"></a><figcaption>Device on hillside leading down to the bowling alley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Church hillside</h3><p dir="ltr">The closest one is on the hill leading down from the church to the bowling alley.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663"></a><figcaption>Found behind the white house on the church street</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Near tool shed</h3><p dir="ltr">Behind the white house on the church street, which is near the Groundskeeper's Tool Shed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666"></a><figcaption>Rooftop device overlooking the gas station</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Bank rooftop</h3><p dir="ltr">On the lower portion of the bank's roof.

This marks the next place you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>This step was oddly buggy for my playthrough. All devices were synced to the corresponding color, but nothing happened. We ended up advancing the round, and then we tried to turn them all back to green to reset them. Once they all turned green, the devices powered up and worked. So, try this if they don't activate the color combo on the Strauss Counter.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Fill the second Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">A new Aether canister has spawned at the gas station. Pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, make sure to pick up the LTG Device off the trap where you left when you captured the first essence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391667" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391667"></a><figcaption>Place the canister next to the trap on the street downhill from the church</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Take the LTG and the canister to the cemetery. This is the same process as before with the HVT. This will be either a Mangler or an Abomination, whichever you didn't get as an HVT the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Place the canister near one of the cemetery traps, which is in the street outside the church, and then place the LTG on the trap piece under the storm. Fight off the zombies for 60 seconds at the LTG until the HVT spawns.</p><p dir="ltr">Weaken the HVT, but <strong>do not kill it right away</strong>. Make sure to lead it near the canister and trap it in the street. This HVT should also spark purple when weak. Activate the trap and make sure it dies while the trap is active to collect the essence into the canister.</p><p dir="ltr">Take this filled canister to the church and deposit into the machine before the timer runs out, <strong>but do not interact with the machine again</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the canister is deposited, the machine will prompt you to interact with it, but <strong>this will start the boss fight</strong>. Now, you'll want to gear up before the boss encounter.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss fight prep</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're able to get all the steps done before round 25, you should be able to make do with level 2 armor and tier 2 Pack-a-Punched weapons. You'll want at least essential perks like Juggernog and Quick Revive. Craft a self-revive if possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Helpful equipment includes Decoy grenades and Monkey Bombs to distract zombies. Napalm ammo mod will help against the larger enemies. Don't bother with aerial killstreaks as you'll be indoors. Try using sentry guns or the Mutant Injection instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Shotguns and LGMs with a high ammo count might be helpful here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss fight</h2><p dir="ltr">This takes place inside the church, so you don't have a lot of wiggle room. This fight is played out in three waves.</p><p dir="ltr">The first wave is just clearing out a ton of zombies, then you'll get an elite Mangler, and finally an elite Abomination. Survive and clear the waves.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the fight is over, there will be a prompt where all of your team gets knocked. So, don't panic. This gives you a final cutscene. The Liberty Falls main Easter egg is now complete.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-how-custom-loadouts-work-in-bo6-zombies/1100-6527402/">full guide on custom Zombies loadouts</a>.

                <p>After more than a year of silence, Bungie has given an update on the development progress of its extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>. The lengthy video is surprisingly light on details, however, with only a hint of future playtests coming in 2025.</p><p>The update, delivered by game director Joe Ziegler, acts more like a reintroduction to Bungie's latest shooter as opposed to a meaningful update. Ziegler spends time explaining what an extraction shooter is, breaking down the high risk, high reward nature of the genre, while also giving brief hints as to how the games different classes might work. It aligns with a lot of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617"> what we already know about Bungie's shooter</a>, making it a gameplay update light on new details</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r8WgMQuPwRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, Ziegler briefly speaks about two of the game's Runners--the name given to Marathon's playable characters--with each of their descriptions suggesting that Marathon is taking hints from existing hero shooters. The first is simply codenamed "Thief", with Ziegler assuming you'll have an idea of their gameplay style from the name alone. The other, codenamed "Stealth", is described as using deception to their advantage on the battlefield, with Ziegler remarking that he's enjoyed playing as the character in tests recently.</p><p>Ziegler stressed that Marathon is still not in a state where the team can show it off just yet, pointing at the various states at which distinct elements are at currently.</p><p>"Where the game is at right now, there's a variety of different things at different states inside of the game. Some things are a little more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really beautiful way. Some of the character models we've been iterating through; they're coming together but they're not fully there yet. Our enemy models are still kind of in an early state so we're still iterating through things to make those land in a strong way," said Ziegler.</p><p>"It's a little early to show you all of it in one piece," he continued. "But as you've noticed, as many of you are familiar with if you're familiar with game development, all of these things are on track. They're not all together, but when they all do come together we really, really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like and play.</p><p>Zielger ended off by inviting players interested in being invited to further tests to wishlist the game on Xbox Series X, PS5, and Steam, with store pages up for Marathon right now. This is the first time Bungie has spoken about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/" data-ref-id="1100-6514533"> Marathon since it's announcement in May 2023</a>, where it said that the next time, writing at the time, "now we’re going dark to focus on the game... and when we come back – we’ll have gameplay to show!". Marathon is still slated for release in 2025, although the Steam listing omits this and simply reads "Coming soon".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jackbox-games-announces-fakin-it-card-game-bringing-their-party-games-to-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Fakin' It card game is on its way. This is a tabletop adaptation of one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jackbox Games'</a> large catalog of digital party games. It is also the studio's first foray into making a physical card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fakin' It</em> Card Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is, understandably, a social deduction card game based on the <em>Fakin' It</em> videogame designed for 3-6 players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-card-game-set-up.jpg?itok=tUzca2eB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-card-game-set-up.jpg?itok=FDUH8ql6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In each game, a single card is drawn from the deck. Each card has a task written on it, that the players must read through their secret wallets. The twist is that one of these wallets won't reveal what the card says, meaning the player has to fake the task to score points.</p>

<p>The <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is broken up into five categories. Hands of Truth involves players raising their hands or keeping them down. Number Pressure has players raising a certain number of fingers between 1-10. You Gotta Point has you pointing fingers at another player or yourself. Face Value is about making facial expressions. Finally, Text You Up is about answering the question on the card truthfully.</p>

<p>If you enjoy a rowdier, raunchier party environment, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game will be releasing alongside <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em>, a version of the game aimed at the 17+ crowd.</p>

<p>This marks the first tabletop game released by Jackbox Games. The studio has made a reputation for itself with entertaining digital party games that can be played on PCs, consoles, or smart phones. Their past work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-survey-scramble-review-wed-like-to-play-steve" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Survey Scramble</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Naughty Pack</em></a>.</p>

<p>Given their body of work has consistently been about simple but fun party game shenanigans, the move from digital to physical is an understandable one.</p>

<p>The Fakin' It card game will be available on Amazon storefronts November 1. Fakin' It will contain 300 cards and will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. Fakin' It All Night Long will include 150 cards and will be available at an MSRP of $9.99.</p>
