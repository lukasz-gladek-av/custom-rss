<p>Such is our calling</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've all been getting a little caught up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> hype recently, but we thought it best to remind you that Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, a new launch trailer specifically for the Switch 2 has been released, and yeah, it's cool. We get a good look at some combat, traversal mechanics, and some of the funky character that you, as protagonist 'The Traveler', will encounter on your journey.</p>
<p>We've been playing Cronos over the last couple of days or so and we'll have a review ready for you very soon, but early impressions point to a solid experience on Switch 2; it looks great, performs well, and the gameplay is a wonderful blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/dead_space">Dead Space</a>, with a little bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/returnal">Returnal</a> thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Oh, and cute cats bring you useful goodies. Winner.</p>
<p>Here's a reminder of the game's synopsis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the acclaimed developers of the SILENT HILL 2 remake, Bloober Team presents <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> — a third-person survival horror experience like no other. Set in the haunting ruins of New Dawn, a world inspired by Nowa Huta, a real historical district in Kraków, Poland, the game unfolds across two timelines: a post-apocalyptic future decaying in despair, and the gritty, industrial 1980s reality. This powerful duality blends retro realism, dystopian sci-fi, and a retro-futuristic atmosphere to create a deeply immersive world filled with tension, mystery, and terror."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Big <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> DLC and even bigger PC gaming handhelds. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still recovering from the Philadelphia Eagles’ narrow escape from the Dallas Cowboys last night. It only took six seconds for star defensive tackle Jalen Carter to get ejected from the game for spitting at opposing quarterback Dak Prescott, only for a second angle to reveal Prescott actually spit first.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">DAK SPAT FIRST?!?! <a href="https://t.co/J2xrMlJRLj">pic.twitter.com/J2xrMlJRLj</a></p> <p>— Bussin' With The Boys (@BussinWTB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BussinWTB/status/1963806763418829238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Carter apparently then asked him if he just spat at him (Prescott’s loogie had little hang-time before going straight to the ground) and Prescott said something to the effect of “why the hell would I do that?” and then Carter decided the time for words had ended and fired back with his own salvo of saliva aimed squarely at Prescott’s chest. <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/05/sports/dak-prescott-explains-his-version-after-new-video-emerges-in-eagles-spit-gate/">The curse of <em>Madden</em> continues</a>? I can’t wait to suffer through another season of the 2024 Super Bowl champions looking like utter frauds.</p> <h2>The Legion Go 2 is almost twice as expensive as the original</h2> <p>Lenovo revealed its newest PC gaming handheld and its impressive specs are overshadowed only by its price tag. It starts at $1,100 or about the price of a 15-inch MacBook Air. For that you get an 8.8 inch OLED display, an AMD Z2 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a> it won’t launch with SteamOS, and it won’t have Microsoft’s new Windows gaming UI that’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">releasing with the Xbox ROG Ally</a> either. None of this is doing much for my enthusiasm for an otherwise cool upgrade.</p>

 <p>It’ll be the beefiest portable PC gaming competitor to the Switch 2 when it arrives on October 31, complete with detachable controller grips, a kickstand, and optical mouse controls. But with the best Legion Go 2 model coming in at almost $1,500, I’m not sure any number of new bells and whistles will get prospective buyers over the sticker shock.</p> <h2><em>Cult of the Lamb</em>‘s <em>Woolhaven</em> DLC will be almost as long as the base game</h2>   <p>The action roguelike base-builder has an expansion coming in early 2026 and developer Massive Monster claims it will <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cultofthelamb/video/7546404300310859026?_t=ZN-8zTCaEzxTMM&amp;_r=1">effectively feel like a second game</a>. The wintery DLC adds new settlement mechanics, levels to explore, and brutal weather to survive. It looks neat but unlike all of the free updates generously showered on players, <em>Woodhaven</em> will be paid. No price has been revealed yet.</p>

 <p>“We tend to go all out, be at weddings, to raves, to three free massive content updates,” the devs said in a TikTok. “This DLC is not free, but I promise you’ll love it.”</p> <h2><em>Schedule 1</em> fans are voting on whether to finally bring shrooms to the hit Steam game</h2> <p>The drug-selling <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/schedule-is-solo-smash-hit-and-the">crewlike</a>‘s <em>Rival Cartels</em> update is live and the next <a href="http://Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms.">community poll</a> is available for players to vote on. The three options are between Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms, a psychedelic not currently available in the game. While drivers would be the most practical, fans of funky fungi have been waiting for their moment in the spotlight. Some players are chanting “Shrooms, baby!” Others say “Fishing EZ.” The weirdos howl “I want police raids so bad.”</p>

 <h2><em>MindsEye</em> devs surprise remaining players by actually continuing to fix the game</h2> <p>“I can’t wait for the next statement from the studio (it’s so fucking over),” wrote Electrical_Sugar_742 a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1n73bx6/i_cant_wait_for_the_next_statement_from_the/">couple of days ago</a>. But Build A Rocket Boy responded with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1n90pgy/update_4_pc_console/">update 4,</a> which is full of changes to the beleaguered action shooter. It addresses PC performance issues and adds quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to finally skip cutscenes. How are players responding?</p> <p>“I’ve deleted it for now,” wrote one. “Maybe by 2040 the game will reach 1.0,” wrote another. The most controversial patch note is “Removed EVERYWHERE vehicles from Build.MindsEye – those vehicles were made accessible unofficially, and we will bring them to MindsEye when they are ready.” User RazorLined wrote, “You guys really thought this was the time to make that change. Really guys. REALLY!?!” Tough crowd.</p>

 <h2>Repair support for every old Nintendo console before the Switch has officially ended</h2> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker ran out of replacement parts for the New 2DS XL this week. “Due to the depletion of parts inventory required for repairs, we have terminated the repair service for the New Nintendo 2DS XL console as of September 4, 2025,” a&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1838479151034175962">post on X</a> reads, per X’s built-in translate function. “Repair services for all other Nintendo 3DS series have also been terminated.”</p> <p>The company ended <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1808707230377914724">repair support</a> for the Wii U last year. With both platforms’ eShops also set down and no online functionality left, the sun has finally set on Nintendo’s pre-Switch years.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/firaxis-lays-off-dozens-devs-civilization-vii-struggles-cuts-2k-2000623187"><em>Civ 7</em> studio Firaxis is laying off a bunch of developers as the game struggles</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/puzzle-quest-immortal-edition-match-3-remaster-2000623170">Another one of the best puzzle games ever is getting a remaster</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aaaaa-silksong-next-gen-pc-devolver-digital-2000623190">GTA 6 will only truly be an “AAAAA” level blockbuster if it can save console gaming</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Former longtime Bethesda marketing and publishing boss Pete Hines retired after Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax, and in a new interview, he discussed one part of his career where he did the "dumbest thing."</p><p>Some may recall that one of the promised items in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-edition-sold-out-bethesda-/1100-6461399/" data-ref-id="1100-6461399">Fallout 76's $200 Power Armor Edition</a> was a canvas West Tek bag. However, upon delivery, fans noticed that the bundle came with a low-cost nylon bag instead. Bethesda eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-canvas-bag-flub-update-bet/1100-6463608/" data-ref-id="1100-6463608">did right by players</a>, but the events clearly left a mark on Hines.</p><p>He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a> that the version of the Power Armor Edition that he signed off on did not have a canvas bag. Someone was trying to "add more value" to the premium edition, and while Hines admits to throwing "sh*t fits" from time to time, in this case, "their hearts were in the right place" with the idea to add more value. What happened was that there was "literally a canvas shortage" at the time, and it was decided by "some folks" to include a nylon bag instead.</p><p>"My biggest failing there was not pushing immediately for making and sending one to everybody that wants one. Because I was still annoyed that the damn thing was in there in the first place, and nobody had told me and that this canvas shortage happened. It's probably the dumbest thing I ever did at Bethesda," he said.</p><p>Bethesda initially announced it would compensate purchasers with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-flub-leads-to-free-/1100-6463537/" data-ref-id="1100-6463537">500 Atoms for Fallout 76</a>, but players quickly roasted Bethesda for this, as it only amounts to $5 worth of compensation. The company later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-canvas-bag-flub-update-bet/1100-6463608/" data-ref-id="1100-6463608">allowed purchasers who received a nylon bag to request a canvas bag.</a></p><p>Fallout 76 is still getting new updates and support, with plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-will-have-more-content-based-on-the-tv-show/1100-6533192/" data-ref-id="1100-6533192">more content to come based on the Prime Video Fallout TV series</a>.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/05/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-review-this-is-the-port-youre-looking-for/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-review-%E2%80%93-this-is-the-port-you%E2%80%99re-looking-for.1289976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Star Wars Outlaws makes a strong case as being the best Star Wars game of recent years. Don’t get me wrong, I like Cal Kestis well enough, and I enjoyed Star Wars Hunters’ riff on Overwatch, but neither of them captured the universe of Star Wars in the way that Outlaws does. It’s helped immensely by lead Kay Vess, a charismatic swindler who never gives up despite finding herself drawn into shady shenanigans far bigger than she could imagine. While it’s been a long time coming, Outlaws finally arrives on Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo’s new handheld proves a perfect place to experience Kay’s adventures.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4pJCxIUm6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Starting in the casino city of Canto Bight – memorably last seen in Star Wars: The Last Jedi – Kay, and her alien companion Nix, immediately show that they’re not the squeaky clean heroes we’re used to portraying in many other gaming universes. She skulks around the city’s backstreets, readying herself for a big score, stealing credits and insinuating herself into the right place at the right time. Soon enough, she makes the mistake of stealing from the wrong people, leaving the planet with the vicious Zliro at her heels.</p>


<p>It’s a great setup, and after crashing on Toshara, you find yourself balancing dirty work between a multitude of shady organisations, trying to curry favour with one, while attempting not to piss the others off too much. Actions have consequences to the story and the options that you’ll have later on, and it feels organic and interconnected, even as you’re embroiled in another unsavoury score with a different alien group.</p>
<p>When the time for being quiet is done, Kay is more than capable of making a hell of a lot of noise, blasting enemies into oblivion, and Outlaws’ mix of sneaking and shooting comes away feeling more like a Star Wars take on Uncharted than the many Assassin’s Creed comparisons. In fact, that’s nigh-on what it is, with plenty of clambering to be done between the quipping and thieving. Nathan Drake would be proud if he wasn’t at the other end of a galaxy, far, far away, and, you know, fictional.</p>

<div id="attachment_463530"><p id="caption-attachment-463530">Credit: Ubisoft via Nintendo</p></div>
<p>Here on Switch 2, you’re likely clamouring to know about performance, and while there have been clear cuts made from the PC, PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series consoles’ visuals, Switch 2 continues to impress as a viable place to play large, graphically intensive open-world games like we’ve seen with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>The first cut is to the frame rate, with the maximum refresh rate sitting at an expected 30fps. Anyone who claims that this is no longer playable hasn’t spent the last twenty years gaming, and it’s a locked 30fps too, making everything feel consistent, smooth and reliable. Would it feel better at 60fps? Yes, of course it would, but if that’s what you’re demanding, then you need to look at playing games of this scale and scope on other, more stationary platforms. This strikes the right balance for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, at times, Star Wars Outlaws looks amazing, and it manages to retain the same sense of scale and wonder that the original release did, even with a reduced resolution and trade offs with texture detail and foliage. That carries through to handheld mode, and while it’s a further step down in terms of resolution, it’s a thoroughly playable way to experience the game, with some smart changes to the UI to make it more palatable on the small screen.</p>
<p>Personally, the most noticeable differences are in the character models, and Kay Vess in particular looks far less detailed in in-engine cutscenes than she does on PC and the other more powerful systems. The character models were many players’ major complaint about those original versions, and they’re cut back further here.</p>
<p>However, you’re mostly going to view her from behind as she sneaks around and shoots aliens in the head, so personally, I wouldn’t worry too much about it. The stellar voice acting is fully present and correct, and the drama continues apace, even without a batch of hyper-detailed character models saying the lines.</p>

<p>Distractions do come though, including the anti-aliasing shimmer around characters’ hair and beards, and there’s texture and shadow pop-in at what doesn’t always feel like the most obvious time. To be honest, the hair is the thing I dislike the most about the whole port, so I really hope they can find a way to alter that, or give you the option of turning some effects off. Crucially, none of these things alter the way the game plays, or how it feels, and they’re easy things to live with when you have a version of the game you can take outside.</p>
<p>There are a few different visual options that affect how you see Star Wars Outlaws, and the cinematic, 12:9 aspect ratio is probably key amongst them. This adds black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, while widening your field of view, and it really makes Outlaws feel more like a part of the Star Wars cinematic universe. You can add the film grain effect to that as well, but while I’m a fan of film grains in general, many will be glad to be able to toggle it off.</p>
<p>While these features were in the original versions, the Switch 2 gains a few exclusives of its own, and motion control is probably my favourite inclusion. Whether you’re playing in handheld or with a Pro Controller, you can utilise motion controls for some added nuance when aiming, and it makes a world of difference to how the gunplay feels and how precise you can be while playing. On top of that, there’s also a nice spot of HD rumble, bringing some extra feels to everything from footsteps to explosions, equivalent to a DualSense on PS5, and there’s the ability to use the touchscreen for menu management when you’re playing in handheld – something even Nintendo forget to include in many of their games!</p>
<div id="attachment_463537"><p id="caption-attachment-463537">Credit: Ubisoft via Nintendo</p></div>
<p>The final, and most stupefying thing, is the install size. This massive, open-world game – and all its previous DLC – has been compressed down to a measly 20GB. You’d expect the audio to have taken a massive hit as part of that, but it’s been done in such a way that I couldn’t tell, and I’m hugely sensitive to audio quality. It’s disappointing that this is yet another Switch 2 key card – apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">because the Switch 2 cartridge isn’t fast enough</a> compared to internal SSD and microSD Express – &nbsp;but at least it’s not making your storage creak and groan any more than is necessary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0675815f8305/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last weekend, the intrepid Alan Lopez hit Seattle to see what PAX West had to offer this year.</p>
<p>He went hands-on with a bunch of titles, large and small, coming to Switch 1 and/or 2, plus a handful more games from devs who would <em>love</em> to bring their work to a Switch near you...but have nothing to announce at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Let's kick things off with a big one from Square Enix...</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>“Octopath Traveler, but with a town builder” is a bit of an odd pitch. That’s where my mind went as I held a Switch 2 unit to demo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, a prequel to an RPG series that’s built up a lot of good faith among old-school RPG fans over its first two entries.</p>
<p>As this still relatively young series is held up proudly as proof of the timelessness of classic RPG elements — pixel art, turn-based combat, a deeply laboured soundtrack, and so on — that this new entry boasts town building as its showstopping new feature felt a little bit more trend-chasing by comparison. Not to mention that in this demo, I was tasked with the customisation of my own party, which flies in the face of the series' namesake, which is predicated on eight-way, pre-written narratives. “How much story are these random characters going to get?” I could only wonder as I clicked on generic avatar after generic avatar.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ade87bf13b895/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>To that point, it was only after I finished blindly placing homes and characters onto my plot of land that Octopath 0 started to feel more engaging in ways I could more immediately perceive. (The promised benefits of the town couldn’t be felt in under 30 minutes of gameplay, after all.)</p>
<p>After all the decorum, I left my little town and began exploring. Unlike the last games, your whole eight-person posse joins a battle as you're attacked in the wild. Every battle screen looked like a moshpit of anime characters, so much so that I found myself button-mashing my enemies to their death (to the disapproval of my Square rep), rather than conducting eight-way permutations of strategy. I get the sense this might only work in the early game, however, alluding to an added depth that could produce a kind of strategy RPG fans could really scale up to.</p>
<p>Luckily, there were elements of the demo that didn’t need any time to coalesce. The gorgeous art direction of HD 2D is looking better than ever, and the HD rumble from just walking around and tapping on things — let alone from the chaotic battles — felt phenomenal on the handheld Switch 2. And yes, we can all rejoice, as the “soundtrack-as-a-character” makes a triumphant return to the series, with musical cues and orchestrations which remain almost distractingly great.</p>
<p>Everything else, however, remains a matter of potential. I look forward to seeing how all these new decisions ultimately gel.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: December 4, 2025</strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Did you come here to read that a Bubsy game might actually be good? Or were you like most people, hoping to rubberneck another massive train crash? Because I’m about to type that a Bubsy game might finally, actually be good… and I’m worried that you, me, and anyone who loves to hate Bubsy might not have prepared ourselves for a universe with a fun Bubsy game in it.</p>
<p>Speaking of universes, that’s where this sequel to the hilariously maligned <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/bubsy_3d">Bubsy 3D</a> (1996) takes place. You’re in space, or something like it. A UFO comes and steals some sheep… or, something? Look, it doesn’t matter. It barely even matters to Bubsy himself. It’s all just an excuse to go jump on stuff, which is where that aforementioned good gameplay comes into play.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy 4D" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5522c9932cc24/bubsy-4d.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Helmed by developer Fabraz (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> takes clear inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> speedrunning fandom culture that’s developed in the wake of that seminal game’s intervening 30+ years. In <em>4D</em>, Bubsy is tasked with reaching checkpoints separated by obstacle courses that have plenty of old-school platformer challenge, along with old-school ways of outsmarting all of them.</p>
<p>The physics of Bubsy’s moves are comprised largely of the most tippy-top, dopamine-producing aspects of Mario’s long jumps, double jumps, and climbing. In other words, it’s a game where the only way you <em>can</em> move makes you go “Weeee!” It’s all very janky! And the game’s visuals and style reinforce and celebrate that jankiness, though not for lack of a mastermind concept; everything you do in Bubsy 4D is designed to be broken. It rewards blistering speedrunning gimmicks most, yet still feels oddly satisfying any way you choose to hop around.</p>
<p>So when I say this game is weird, and kind of “bad” intentionally, I mean it from a place of deep reverence for the platformers of yesteryear, which Bubsy 4D clearly demonstrates a full understanding and clever embracing of. For once, it feels like Bubsy might be in on the joke.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: “Coming soon”</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>After experiencing this impressively produced indie title by developer brlka and publisher Ysbryd Games, I couldn’t quite tell you what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> is about. But here’s what I can say: this horror 2D platformer makes you feel constantly on edge, quite uncertain, and eventually <em>locked in</em>.</p>
<p>You play as Maya, “a suburban child stolen from her family on the whim of a lonely god…escaping a castle built of bitter memories,” or at least that’s what’s going on according to the press release. As far as the demo goes, all you really know is that you’re a sleeping girl who gets called down from her room to join her family for dinner. Teenager stuff. Before you can sit down and eat, though, your mom asks you to go pick up a ringing telephone — yes, a landline, really accentuating the “bitter memories” part of the game’s description. It’s a fruitless task that rewards you only with a dial tone and an empty dinner table upon your return.</p>
<p>Then you go outside. Your house is magically burned to the ground. The atmosphere is morose and an ugly kind of blue. Lacking any alternative, your adventure begins as you head right, giving way to a series of 2D gravity platforming challenges that borrow most heavily from indie classics <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, except with an added nagging stress that something is very, very wrong.</p>
<p>It’s that upsetting undercurrent that makes Love Eternal conceptually exciting well beyond its gameplay influences. Without spoiling too much, it’s a very bold game that feels free to mess with you however it pleases, whenever it pleases.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: “2025”</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/table_tactics">Table Tactics (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>What <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/table_tactics">Table Tactics</a> currently lacks in total polish, it makes up for in deeply amusing physics-based gameplay, the kind that kept me glued to my demo — as if I need another “just-one-more-turn” game in my life.</p>
<p>Those familiar with tabletop RPGs will have a leg-up on this action-strategy game, but honestly, despite the game’s menus borrowing from the complexity of that fandom, you don’t really need any experience with TTRPGs.</p>
<p>The game presents you with a literal table that you strategically cover in battle units: archers, swordsmen, catapults and the like. In typical medieval fashion, bad guy units begin to flood the table in waves, which you engage with in turn-based combat, not using hitpoints, but physics. For example, using my catapult, I sent a literal marble through the air and right into a pocket of enemies. It sent them all flying but one, which wobbled and survived like a stubborn bowling pin keeping me from a strike.</p>
<p>Using not much more than geometry, Table Tactics brings an excellent dose of action into a genre that is typically monopolised by number crunching and rules, which is giving my attention-deficit-brain a strategy game to actually look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/woodo">Woodo (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>What sets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/woodo">Woodo</a> apart from other 'cosy' games is obvious at a glance: holy heck, this adorable little puzzle game looks stunning, punching way above its weight in the graphics department. It's quickly obvious what a labour of love this is for developer Tiny Monks Tales, a tiny team of three, with the care and attention put into every single pixel.</p>
<p>The premise is far less complex than its visuals. You follow the tale of a little fox named Foxy, or at least you do once you click and drag pieces of her into the appropriate places to build her. That’s the gameplay; you get presented with a wooden, lifeless diorama of a scene, which you spin around in order to hunt for the exact location where every item in your inventory should go, almost like building a Lego set with light suggestions rather than instructions. Placing the right piece into just the right spot brings it to life with colour, often triggering a calming narration designed to feel like someone reading you a kid’s book.</p>
<p>It’s an extremely relaxing and charming game, akin to kicking back and painting little figures. (And frankly, it might be perfect if you want to gateway your little ones into painting Warhammer figurines.)</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: "2026"</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sacrifire">SacriFire (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>The love affair between modern-day game devs and turn-based strategy feels never-ending these days, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sacrifire">SacriFire</a> is a game that aims to blend some new ideas into that original RPG recipe.</p>
<p>The game has been in development for several years, and this latest coat of paint from developer and publisher Pixilated Milk really showed off how far the game has come. The whole experience is gorgeous to look at with its 2D and 3D blended art direction, and it’s equally interesting to play, thanks to its real-time RPG mechanics where battle only moves whenever you do.</p>
<p>In the demo, after some basic RPG set-up, you find yourself in a dynamic battle where health and data are propped up above the characters as you run around a given circle to fight. Enemies shoot their shot (literally), which only move across the screen as you move your character within a circle, everything completely freezing when you do. It produces a sort of slow-motion bullet-hell kind of dodging and weaving.</p>
<p>For comparison’s sake, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a> was offered by the developers as a major inspiration, though the unique battle system reminded me of the recently released indie gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arco">Arco</a>, with a little bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kingdom_hearts_-_hd_1_5_plus_2_5_remix_-_cloud_version">Kingdom Hearts</a> (if it were on the Sega Genesis) vibes — two very high compliments.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that it’s hard to tell with limited exposure how the full soundtrack will sound, but it is highly anticipated, as SacriFire is being helmed by none other than Motoi Sakuraba, composer of such OST gems as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/golden_sun">Golden Sun</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_ocean">Star Ocean</a>, and yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_tennis">Mario Tennis</a>.</p>
<p>As for how the story holds up — “Ezekiel Ridan, a young priest, struggles to keep his faith as the world he loves is threatened by a war between gods and demons.” — we’ll have to wait and see, as SacriFire is nearing release early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: Q1 2026</strong></p>

<p><em>And now for a handful of games not yet confirmed for Switch, although we (and indeed their makers) have our fingers crossed...</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Rebounder</h2>

<p>As a professional game reviewer, you get exposed to so many games that you rarely get stunned into submission. So on that rare occasion when it’s a game’s graphics that stop you in your tracks, you do your best to communicate it with words. But honestly, I implore you to just click on the trailer and watch it, because nothing besides moving pictures can do <strong>Rebounder</strong> true justice.</p>
<p>This game is like if the <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> intro was a video game. This game is like if the grainy comics of a 1930s newspaper were magically animated on the paper, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority">Comics Code Authority badge</a> and all. This game feels gritty, surprises you with off-the-wall animations screen after screen, and feels ice cool. Reader, I don’t want you to stop reading, but please go watch it in action.</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s just a fact that a lot of people are going to be stuck <em>watching</em> someone play this game, rather than playing it themselves; Rebounder’s gameplay is absolutely brutal. Whatever exists of a plot is centred around space-industrial labour extraction, as you’re a sort of coal miner of the future. That sets up the core idea of spelunking to grab these little floating orbs scattered around 2D obstacle courses, which you can grab and carry, and which have the bouncy physics of a basketball. They allow you exactly one double-jump before they expire back to where you grabbed them from.</p>
<p>Thus, what begins as a simple double-jump to the next room quickly evolves into elaborate off-the-wall self-passes through dangerous twists, turns, and spikes. You will die over and over again. People had to look away from the screen out of sheer frustration while I was playing. Though for anyone who loves outrageous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker</a> levels and old-school platformer challenges, Rebounder is <em>heavenly</em> the way it makes you feel like a Harlem Globetrotter in space. Whether you are a fan of the genre or not, keep an eye (or two) on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD, Switch version TBD</strong></p>
</div><div><h2>Hyperbeat</h2>

<p>Rhythm games can sometimes feel like a simple way to get started in game development — build some menus, grab a song, and build the entire experience out on rails. <strong>Hyperbeat</strong>, an upcoming indie title from co-developers Alice Bottino and Chancellor Wallin, is having <em>none</em> of that; it’s narratively ambitious from the first screen on, and it never stops being extra wild, weird, and interesting.</p>
<p>The demo started with a strangely gripping scene between your low-polygonal character and a crow. Then followed an amusing character-building menu where you choose between irreverent but awesome neon styles. Oh, and it’s also worth mentioning your character’s walking animation, which consists of, I wanna say, three or four frames. In all, this low-fi, retro style might be easy to emulate, but it’s difficult to really make this style one’s own the way Hyperbeat does with ease. For those with an encyclopedic knowledge of video game history, I have to go back to 1999’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/vib_ribbon">Vib Ribbon</a> for my nearest point of comparison between narrative, graphics, and sound.</p>
<p>All of this stuff happens before you get even a single note of music — you know, the actual game itself — which is ultimately delivered in the form of your stick figure creation flying through a cylindrical tube aiming for octagons and arrows to slash at, hopefully in perfect time with the music. Something about how the gameplay flows in Hyperbeat really gets at your dopamine, because it’s all so extremely satisfying the way it comes at you so quickly. The fact that missing notes doesn’t make the experience stumble to a crawl goes a long way to making you feel like Mickey Mouse in <strong>Fantasia</strong>, majestically pointing things into existence — in this case, a dope-ass techno beat.</p>
<p>Hyperbeat might sound a bit unassuming of a title, and its creators are still green, yet this is somehow one of the most satisfying rhythm gameplay loops I’ve ever played. I truly can’t wait to play (and hear) more of it.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD, Switch version TBD.</strong></p>
</div><div><h2>Echo Weaver</h2>

<p>From the developer of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>-like indie title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wild_at_heart">The Wild at Heart</a> now comes <strong>Echo Weaver</strong>, a self-described <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block">“MetroidBRAINia”</a> title that plays like Metroid, but on a time loop.</p>
<p>It’s a little hard to keep up with that description, just the same as it is to understand what’s happening when you first start it. You play as a “weaver” in a labyrinth not unlike any Metroidvania you’ve ever played. But unlike Metroid itself, the game is <em>technically</em> beatable from the very first screen, earning its “MetroidBRAINia” description by the way you learn from your mistakes as you go.</p>
<p>You will do this in speedrunning fashion, as the flow of the game picks up steam until your sad, untimely death, after which you teleport back to your previous save point on a time loop, armed only with the knowledge of what you did wrong. When it all clicks, the gameplay unfolds like a clever speedrunning action piece where you bound over explosions, outsmart booby traps, and simply knowing what the door password is the next time around</p>
<p>It’s like if the classic movies <strong>Aliens</strong> and <strong>Run Lola Run</strong> had a baby, which of course would be stylistic and fast. Not a bad combo.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD, Switch version TBD</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for the right pair of headphones? The three most important factors are do they look good do they sound good, and will they not empty my bank account? Well, you can go right ahead and check off all three boxes with <strong>the Marshall Major V on-ear wireless headphones</strong>. These Bluetooth headphones are stylish as heck, produce great sound, and pretty dang affordable. They’re normally listed at $160. However, Amazon has them as part of a limited time deal at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">They’re going now for as low as 38% off which drops the price by a solid $61.

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long Listening Time</h2>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, has officially reached a milestone of one million copies sold. This figure, announced by Konami via its official <a href="https://x.com/KONAMIUK/status/1963892658960482616" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Twitter account</a>, represents internal sales tracking rather than third-party verified numbers.</p><p>Still, the milestone marks a significant achievement for the project, which has faced intense scrutiny and pressure given the iconic status of the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It's on par with sales figures for <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">other remakes in the series</a>, and could potentially surpass them given time.</p><p>The milestone is notable not just for the sales figures, but also for the weight of its legacy. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first major installment in the series since Hideo Kojima, the franchise's creator and longtime creative force, parted ways with Konami in 2015. The spin-off Metal Gear Survive, which was developed after Kojima had left the company, was not well-received.</p><p>Kojima himself was asked earlier this summer whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">he would consider playing the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, and his response was candid and dismissive. With a laugh, the legendary designer replied, "No, I won't." While brief, Kojima’s comments highlighted the enduring tension between him and Konami, a rift that has continued to shadow every Metal Gear-related development since their split.</p><p>Solid Snake's original American voice actor, David Hayter, said he would have liked to have been involved with Delta just so he could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-would-have-loved-a-redo-with-metal-gear-solid-delta/1100-6534214/" data-ref-id="1100-6534214">redo a lot of the dialogue</a> which carried over from the 2004 game to the remake. "I do feel that I'm a little better of an actor now than I was then," said Hayter. "It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the past 20 years to it."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During a livestream for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeOWfNAuVUk">Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis</a>, of all things, a director on the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series at Square Enix, Tetsuya Nomura, provided a couple of small updates on Kingdom Hearts 4 and Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. </p>



<p>Translated by <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884">Aitaikimochi on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Nomura doesn't go into any great detail, and is only able to comment on their development progress, with both games, according to Nomura, being "<em>on schedule</em>." He even goes on to say, per Aitaikimochi's translation, that Square Enix has a date picked for when they'll announce Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, asking fans to "<em>please wait for it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So, regarding Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, you see, Toriyama supposedly said we will have news around the time of the second anniversary of Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis. We are making great progress on the game, and I can't say anything else...We are indeed making a lot of progress with the game. We already have decided when we will make the announcement as well, and we will stick to that time schedule. So don't worry, but please wait for it.</em>"</p>



<p>He offers the same update for Kingdom Hearts 4, but doesn't imply that Square Enix is close to any kind of reveal or that it has a date picked out for the next big drop of Kingdom Hearts 4 news.</p>



<p>"<em>On that same note, I'm seeing a lot of comments asking about Kingdom Hearts 4. We are making great strides and going according to schedule. So please wait for more information on that."</em></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I translated Nomura’s quote from the FF7EC stream regarding FF7 Remake Part 3 and Kingdom Hearts 4.</p><p>Both games are making great progress. They have already decided on when they will make the big announcement for FF7R Part 3, so stay tuned!</p><p>Here are the subs for his comment! <a href="https://t.co/Immgd4FtW3">pic.twitter.com/Immgd4FtW3</a></p></div>— ☆オードリーAudrey☆ (@aitaikimochi) <a href="https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's been a little more than three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/">announced</a>, and you can add Tetsuya Nomura's words here to the list of very small updates we've gotten for the game in the time since, while we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-english-recording/">seen a few</a> more <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">significant updates</a> on how Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing. That said, hopefully, the fact that Square Enix has a reveal date picked out means that we can forget about last year's report that we'll have to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-may-be-four-years-away/">wait until 2028 to close off this remake trilogy</a>. Unless the date it has picked is in 2027, of course.</p>

I fear and covet no videogame genre on this Earth like the bullet hell shoot 'em up. I find these scions of the arcades irresistibly beautiful. They look like how I imagine human nervous systems appear to thunder spirits. By the same token, I’m not sure they're actually designed to be processed by the human nervous system. They're the sort of game the androids will play, once they’ve hunted down and incinerated the last of our kind.

Within the shmup genre, the Touhou Project series stands as a diamond-hard constellation of electrochemical pizazz. Dating back to 1997, it spans 20 mainline games and 13 spin-offs, all created by Team Shanghai Alice, a studio that apparently consists of a single guy, Nagano, Japan-based Jun'ya Ōta. The series has spawned a vast cosmos of fanworks. Today sees the release of another fan game, Touhou Kouzougi ～ Flickerframe Shutter Festival from Brazilian game developer Ryann Thierry. 'Tengu paparazzo', you say? Seems worth a quick post. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
I’m writing about Flickerframe Shutter Festival partly because I really like that trailer soundtrack – the game's score is the work of Benji Tunez, and is apparently full of references to other Touhou productions – and partly, because this is my first exposure to the concept of a “photography bullet hell”. As in other shmups, the basic idea here is to survive on a screen that looks like a tornado full of stinging jellyfish. The twist is that rather than just shooting bullets back at the source of those projectiles, you’re trying for a Kodak moment. 
</p><p>
“Use your camera to take shots of the bosses, while also clearing the projectiles shot by them!” explains the blurb. “Acquire new skills given to you by your clients to aid you in your sessions! Try getting the craziest shots to overcome your highest scores!”
</p>
<p>
Photographing bosses to death – what a concept! I actually think I might be able to master this one, inasmuch as a lesser-known vidyagame gurnalist skill is taking screenshots during fights. For the professional hack, there is no shame greater than having to illustrate a breathless description of a nuclear haymaker with a picture of the protagonist looking at a table, or something. 
</p>
<p>
True, you can automate the taking of screengrabs nowadays, but I’ve always preferred the personal touch - and I’m sure that old school obstinacy will stand me in good stead as I try to beat Flickerframe Shutter Festival. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3829880/Touhou_Kouzougi__Flickerframe_Shutter_Festival/">Which you can find on Steam</a>.

              <p>Pokémon Poke-nade Monster Ball may sound like the world’s weirdest energy drink crossover, but it is in fact the translated name for Pokémon’s latest venture, a Tamagotchi-style interactive keychain pet, albeit far more complex than the Tamagotchis of old. Which of course raises two all-important questions: Can you let the Pokémon starve to death? And will it poop?</p> <p>This&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> a Pokémon x Tamagotchi situation, it should be said. That has happened before, as a matter of fact: an official crossover with Bandai Namco’s pocket toys happened in 2019, with the retro devices selling out day one on the Pokémon Center. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1p92K06svQ">YouTuber UnlistedLeaf</a> once found himself trapped caring for a teeny pixel Eevee that incessantly demanded food, but instead of pooping would cough up furballs. And no, that one didn’t die if you failed to look after it, but instead ran away. Which is kind of horrifying in its own right.</p>  <p>This new venture (<a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/pokemon-is-getting-its-own-official-tamagotchi-style-virtual-pet/">spotted by <em>Essential Japan</em></a>), which is with Bandai rival Takara Tomy looks like a much more advanced toy. First of all, it’s in color, but also encased in a Poké ball shell, with a touch-sensitive screen. The latter is because a part of looking after your pocket-sized pocket monster is stroking it (that’s the “Poke-nade” part of the name, which is a portmanteau of Pokémon and “naderu,” to stroke).</p>

 <p>Apparently, poking at the screen will get the Pokémon to react in various cutesy ways. According to&nbsp;<em>Essential Japan</em>, “the Pokémon will react differently depending on the length and speed of the petting,” and you are fully able to make your own revolting jokes right here.</p> <p>The Monster Ball sounds pretty impressively in-depth compared to the Tamagotchi, which could only eat, sick up fur, and eventually evolve. This new toy will let you play with the Pokémon, and even take part in Pokémon battles. There’s also a diary feature that’ll remember all your previous interactions, and the device will apparently offer 157 different Pokémon to choose from. Some of them—Pikachu, Eevee, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, Lucario and Sylveon—will even be voiced and come with more detailed animations.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623448">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>That inclusion of Sylveon on the list does suggest one peculiar aspect, however. If you can start with an Eevee or a Sylveon, it does indicate that the monsters might not be able to evolve. An odd choice if true, especially given the Paldean starter Pokémon included get far more entertaining as they grow.</p> <p>It looks like these will be a Japan-only release for now, but despite featuring a touch screen and far more complexity than a Tamagotchi, they’re surprisingly cheap. ¥7,480, which works out to just over $50. However, I’m absolutely certain they’ll sell out almost instantly, and go for far higher resale prices to the rest of the world.</p> <p>But can they die?! Do they poop?! We <em>don’t know</em>. It seems incredibly unlikely, given The Pokémon Company overrode the usual rules for Tamagotchi when it partnered with them, but it’ll be interesting to learn how the game responds to a bad owner. Or a messy one.</p>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive got into the publishing game with its IOI Partners program, and MindsEye--from former Rockstar developer Leslie Benzies' Build a Rocket Boy--was the company's first published game. The game struggled mightily out of the gate, with many criticizing its technical performance, among other things. Now, IO's CEO, Hakan Abrak, has reacted to the launch and discussed whether or not the company will continue to publish others' games.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Abrak told IGN</a> that when IO was first chatting with Build a Rocket Boy, the idea was to find a way to "support them," because IO believed in the company's "great ideas." IO was coming in to help Build a Rocket Boy--a brand-new game developer with no releases under its belt before MindsEye--distribute the game.</p><p>For whatever reason, MindsEye had issues, and Abrak addressed this frankly. "Well, that was definitely tough, right?" he said. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners."</p><p>Abrak went on to say that Build a Rocket Boy is now "working hard on turning that around" to help regain trust. He added that he believes the team has "tons of potential."</p><p>MindsEye just got its <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1963898695214039479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fourth major update this week</a>, and it's a big one, weighing in at as much as 15GB. It fixes bugs and makes performance improvements. A fifth major patch is coming next.</p><p>But will IO continue to publish games via its IOI Partners program? Abrak wasn't ready to confirm anything one way or another. He said IO will publish its own games, including the upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>. But future partnerships? "That remains to be seen," Abrak said.</p><p>007 First Light was the focus of a special PlayStation State of Play broadcast this week, during which IO announced the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-release-date-confirmed-arrives-just-before-gta-6/1100-6534459/" data-ref-id="1100-6534459">release date</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">showed off new gameplay</a>, and revealed a $300 collector's edition featuring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/" data-ref-id="1100-6534460">replica Golden Gun.</a></p>

That sentiment rings true now more than ever, as Barone juggles multiple projects--including the newly announced Stardew Valley 1.7 update and a surprise voice cameo in Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/stardew-valleys-eric-barone-is-in-the-hollow-knight-silksong-credits-for-voicing-a-mystery-character/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> caught Barone's name appearing in the credits of Silksong, listed alongside members of Team Cherry and even the family of lead designer William Pellen. Given the shared success of Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight, which launched within a year of each other and became landmark indie titles, it's no surprise their creators have formed connections within the indie development scene.</p><p>His role in Silksong involved providing non-verbal character sounds--for those familiar, Nintendo-style chirps and mutterings--for one of the game's new NPCs. While Barone hasn't revealed which character he voiced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> confirmed it was indeed him. Fans are now left to guess which bug-like denizen of the kingdom of Parloom bears his signature tones.</p><p>Despite this side contribution, Barone remains fully focused on Haunted Chocolatier. Even though the 1.7 update for Stardew Valley may slow development slightly, Barone insists the impact will be minimal. As for his voice work in Silksong, it was a small and likely long-completed task and more a fun detour than a distraction.</p>

<p>One these roles features a developer with which you might be quite familiar: Eric Barone, A.K.A. ConcernedApe, A.K.A the creator of a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape">The Verge</a>, Barone's name can be seen in Silksong's credits under the 'Additional Character Voices' section.</p>
<p>However, while Cole Medeiros, head of operations and biz dev at ConcernedApe LLC, confirmed to The Verge that it is indeed the Eric Barone we're all thinking of, he refrained from confirming exactly which role the creator plays in Silksong in an effort to maintain some of the mystique. Fair play, really.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zmvyrn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nba-2k-college-basketball-experience-confirmed-2k-sports-ea-sports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-confirms-a-%E2%80%9Ccollege-basketball-experience%E2%80%9D-is-in-the-works-for-its-nba-2k-series.1289847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After it was reported that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-no-more-ea-loses-to-2k-sports/">EA Sports had lost out to 2K Sports</a> in capitalizing on the chance to bring collegiate basketball back to videogames in the way that EA has done with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/">College Football</a>, 2K took a victory lap and confirmed that it will be creating a "<em>college basketball experience</em>" for its NBA 2K games, some of which 2K implies we'll start to see in NBA 2K26, which is out today at the time of this writing, on September 5, 2025.</p>



<p>Yesterday, we learned through an internal memo first reported by Extra Points that EA Sports was walking away from trying to bring about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-return/">EA Sports College Basketball game it had teased in June</a>. Enough schools had instead chosen to take 2K's proposal of being included in the NBA 2K games, so EA took its ball and went home, rescinding the offers it had put out to various colleges and universities in the United States, leaving 2K's proposal the only one on the board.</p>



<p>Not too long after those reports hit the wire, 2K put out a statement on <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1963775457876406534">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and confirmed that it is "<em>going back to school.</em>" It even took the chance to take a dig at EA by highlighting the fact that its proposal to schools was the "<em>quality</em>" choice.</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, it's true. We're working on a college basketball experience that will feature more than 100 programs from across the country, from powerhouses to Cinderella stories. Competition fuels quality at all levels, which is why our approach with college basketball ensures our partner schools, college athletes and our players all benefit.</em>"</p>



<p>The statement then goes on to indicate we'll start to see some air of what this full experience will be in this year's release, though it does clarify that players should expect the majority of what this will become starting in 2027, and expect it to grow from there. "<em>You won't have to wait long to start seeing your favorite colleges show up in game. We've got big plans for 2027 and beyond, and even a few surprises coming in early 2026."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We've proven the quality of the basketball experience we can deliver for years,"</em> the statement continues, "<em>and have</em> <em>every intention</em> <em>to bring that same level of quality to college hoops</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are surely some disappointed college basketball fans who might've wanted it to have a college basketball-dedicated game, depending on how far 2K takes the college mode its building, it might just be the best scenario to get your college and professional league basketball in one package, instead of having to buy two games, the way American football fans have to buy two football games.</p>



<p>It's also admittedly fun to see 2K and EA compete like this, and to see both seemingly fire small shots at the other, with more understandably coming from 2K at EA's expense, with them being the victor in this collegiate basketball game derby.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that sales of recent stealth remake&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>have reached a major milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>has managed to surpass a million sales across both physical and digital versions (and, naturally, across all platforms). This, Konami says, "reflects the enduring popularity of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-at-state-of-play" rel="nofollow">faithfully-rendered remake</a> of the original 2004 stealth classic, complete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal" rel="nofollow">revamped visuals and gameplay</a>, as well as new quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sales-guards.jpg?itok=o1GsH4Pn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sales-guards.jpg?itok=JB58wSOC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>has hit a million sales worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>While the structure of&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>'s story, as well as its original voice acting and music (with the exception of a re-recorded version of the title song), remain intact, the remake has also changed a number of things in order to bring the game up to date.</p>

<p>Changes include a new over-the-shoulder camera mode, as well as the ability to switch between various camo presets on the fly, thus (I think) fixing one of the original game's most irksome problems.</p>

<p>The visuals have also been updated and reworked courtesy of the game's shift to Unreal Engine 5, making for some pretty breathtaking jungle vistas and some rather impressive character model work to boot.</p>

<p>If, however, you're expecting a completely transformative remake along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, you're going to be disappointed;&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>retains the skeleton of the original game, so it's really just the visuals and gameplay that have been tweaked and improved.</p>




<p>If you're playing on PC or PlayStation 5, you'll also find the classic Snake vs. Monkey mode included, and a new Fox Hunt multiplayer mode is also set to debut on all platforms later this year.</p>

<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater.algolia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater/9pjln214rtkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>
Not long before joining Rock Paper Shotgun, I wrote a feature for Edge magazine about the origins of the very silly term "AAA game". The overall conclusion I came to is that "AAA game" is possibly a boardroom-level borrowing from the credit rating industry and Hollywood, and that it has little meaning beyond "most expensive/biggest". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a bauble casually excreted by pinstriped cats wallowing in jacuzzis sometime in the mid-90s, for the benefit of the investor class. But in much the same way that any fleck of dust can become a pearl, or at least a larger clump of dust, so the term has attracted additional meanings and significance over the ensuing years, partly because game journalists like myself keep taking it seriously.</p>
<p>My interviewees talked about triple-A's association with the shift to polygonal 3D graphics, with certain genres such as the open world, with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and with exclusive hiring practices that require "triple-A experience" and thus have an unavoidable bias, given that "triple-A" studios have often been staffed predominantly by people of a certain race, gender and background.
</p>
<p>
These more specific developments aside, triple-A has shed an A to produce the retrospectively beloved genre of "AA games", aka grainy noughties shooters with a gimmick, and also sprouted additional As. Concluding the Edge write-up, I touched briefly and humorously on Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/">coining of "AAAA game" </a>in a brazen attempt to mindfuck people complaining about the delayed release and pricing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>. 
</p><p>
As sure as the sparrows fly south for winter, another executive has now gazumped Guillemot. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">Ian Games</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/god-help-us-all-gta-6-may-be-a-aaaaa-game-says-devolver-co-founder-and-thats-why-the-entire-industry-is-taking-cover-from-it-like-its-a-nuclear-blast/">Percy Gamer</a> for spotting) about the dark art of competing with other publishers for release dates, Devolver co-founder Nigel Lowrie has described <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> as an "AAAAA game". Here's the complete sentence: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I mean, there are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game, it's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Lowrie isn't the first to try this, admittedly. CD Projekt Red's investor relations VP Karolina Gnaś <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-nielubowicz-chief-financial-officer-i-karolina-gnas-vp-ds-relacji-inwestorskich-cd-projekt-sa-start-29-marca-o-godz-1100,704">has already been there and bought the T-shirt</a>. But Gnaś was poking fun at Ubisoft's "AAAA game" claim at the time, whereas Lowrie seems to be in earnest. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, he seems to think that "AAAA game" is everyday parlance now. I, for one, was not consulted about this, but I can see why The Industry might be in a hurry to leave AAAA behind. To my knowledge, the only card-carrying AAAA games besides the ailing Skull and Bones are Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the current record-holder for longest-serving vapourware, and Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot, which was recently cancelled. If AAA means "most expensive/biggest", AAAA basically seems to mean "doomed".
</p><p>
The whole circus is worth following inasmuch as it's a crude illustration of the continuing drive to appease investors who are not content with the "maturation" of returns, and are always looking for the next Level Up. Still, I realise the advanced financial language may be confusing to ordinary humans, so I've put together this quick-and-dirty cheatsheet for both existing A-based videogame lifeforms and those likely to emerge the next time an executive joins an earnings call. Here you go:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
AAA - GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAA - Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAA - GTA 6
</p>
<p>
AAAAAA - GTA 6 on max settings
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6: Ultimate Whale's Edition with fully operational Quantum Field simulation and digital rights management supplied by orbital self-guided "Blundershut &amp; Custard" Clockwork Plasma Cannon array
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + gravitational implosion of known universe
</p>
<p>
A - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Gabe, and the Word was Gabe. The same was in the beginning with Gabe. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
<p>AA - [DESYNCHRONIZED]
</p>
<p>
AAA - GTA 3 again

</p></blockquote>
<p>PS. I've just noticed that Edge feature is on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/aaa-developers-discuss-the-three-little-letters-that-have-shaped-an-industry-its-a-stupid-term-its-meaningless/">Gamesradar</a> now, if you fancy a read.</p>

Steam concurrent player numbers, which do not tell the whole story of a game’s popularity, were worryingly low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Benzies told staff that the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming its struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post to the MindsEye community issued today, September 5, BARB said “we remain committed to refining MindsEye and enhancing the gameplay experience. Ongoing updates will continue to be shared.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Update 4 introduces a range of UX improvements, numerous performance enhancements, and tackles bugs. Update 4 is significant in terms of size, weighing in at 15GB on PC, 7.2GB on PS5, and 12.1GB on Xbox Series X and S. Update 5 will deliver a "major" performance, combat and enemy AI system improvement, BARB teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, the CEO of MindsEye publisher IO Interactive, which is working on 007 First Light, responded to the game’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">telling IGN</a>: “that was definitely tough, right?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is whether BARB can save MindsEye by encouraging players not just to come back to the game, but to actually buy it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MindsEye Update 4 Patch
