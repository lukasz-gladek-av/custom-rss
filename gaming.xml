            <p>Images of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have leaked online, including multiplayer maps, menu screens, and perks.</p>
<p>Within hours, the screenshots were hit with copyright claims from Activision, adding credence to the claims they come from an in-development build. However, this is the internet, which means nothing's ever truly gone, and the images are still going up faster than Activision can remove them.</p>

<p>According to the leaker – who distributed the images via a throwaway Twitter/X account – they were unable to secure images or information about the single-player campaign or Black Ops 6's  zombies mode.</p>
<p>Other images hint at a reworked UI and menu system, although it's possible the menus only look that way because it's an in-development build.</p> <div>

Even so, it can be a fun option for those who wish to only occasionally use sorceries in niche situations. Perfect for those looking to live their best spellsword lives. - Billy Givens <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-carian-sword-location-1851607548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-carian-sword-location-1851607548">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbfa9eb448535a2e28538874940035a0" data-recommend-id="image://fbfa9eb448535a2e28538874940035a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Tarnished stands at the ready with a sword that's actually just a poorly impaled lizard boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished stands at the ready with a sword that's actually just a poorly impaled lizard boy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbfa9eb448535a2e28538874940035a0" data-recommend-id="image://fbfa9eb448535a2e28538874940035a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Tarnished stands at the ready with a sword that's actually just a poorly impaled lizard boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Lizard Greatsword is a new Greatsword that you can only obtain in <em>Elden Ring’</em>s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span> expansion.

		<p>This morning is yet another where we have woken up to the news that the far right continues to riot across the UK, and it is anxiety inducing. For the first time in my 35 years of life, I feel, like many other, unsettled in the country we call home. Disinformation, dishonesty, and dishonourable acts have led to the violent disorder perpetrated by a loud, violent, minority, and it is time that there is a reckoning against all of this.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was told by my family members who were born here in the 60s and 70s, of the violence they faced due to groups such as the National Front, and after decades of hard work to stamp this prejudice out and make our society more equal and equitable, it seems that we are sliding back to those dark times. To see the reports of the far-right and – let’s not beat around the bush here – of racists co-opting a tragedy as an excuse to attack anyone who is not white is disgusting and rage inducing. But we did not get here in a vacuum.</p>
<p>For years, we have seen traditional media, social media, and algorithm-led platforms pushing far-right figures to the fore on a regular basis. This is despite warnings from individuals and groups that doing so emboldens these figures and spreads their message. Challenging them in the social media space does not work, especially if some of those spaces are owned by those that agree with such views. I point to the traditional media groups, both broadcast and newspapers, that have have barely challenged far right talking points, and instead used them to validate their own messages instead. We have seen headlines from the likes of the Daily Mail and The Sun constantly attack those from non-white and non-Christian backgrounds, fuelling hate.&nbsp; Even the likes of the BBC have not helped in this matter, platforming Nigel Farage a record 32 times on Question Time under the pretence of providing balanced opinions, while ITV featured him in I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, which might have made him seem more affable to some.</p>
<p>All of this has led to massive changes to our society, most significantly propelling us toward Brexit, and now in the most recent General Election, to Reform snatching 14% of the vote, and attracting members of the far-right to it in the process. Even now, reporting on the riots is still being framed as protest across the media landscape, conflating legitimate protest with actual violent disorder and thuggery. Every single reporter and editor in our media should have a frank and open discussion on how they report on issues that affect people from minority backgrounds, and how their reporting over the years has fuelled what has now happened, instead of acting surprised at the result. Will it happen? That is unlikely.</p>
<p>Our politicians have not helped either. Over the last 14 years, all we have really had is culture wars and divisive politics. Asylum seekers have been othered by the very highest of offices, and now are under violent attack. What is worse is a lot of this rhetoric has come from people who are from minority backgrounds, pandering to the far right for a grip on power. They think that moving even further right will get them in the top jobs again. The reality is that once the far right is done with them, they will be discarded and grouped in with the rest of us as an other. Social media is also to blame, allowing constant disinformation to spread faster than the truth and featuring algorithms that push far-right content. On my own Facebook feed I am constantly shown posts from such groups even though I am not a member of any of them, nor do I want to see them. Social media companies need to be held to account and disinformation needs to be stamped out at the source.</p>

<p>Reversing this trend will take a huge amount of effort, and our education system has a large role tackling the narrative that people from minority backgrounds are only recent arrivals to this country or that they are not British. The British Empire lasted hundreds of years and saw people from all over move across it. The first Indian MP elected to the UK Parliament was Dadabhai Naoroji in 1892, something that is not taught in schools. Britain has been quick to show pride that it was the leader in abolishing slavery, while not giving credence to folks like Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, Olaudah Equiano, and Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, all of whom are Black Britons that lived during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Our education system skips over Empire, ignoring the hard truths that at one stage in this country’s history there was a huge dark period that saw millions suffer, while a few benefited.</p>
<p>We have to remember that the far-right is loud and often violent, but it is a minority. That lesson needs to especially be learned by those that platform them regularly. Even though they are a minority, the far right has to be guarded against and pushed back against over the long term. This morning I signed up as a member to <a href="https://www.rota.org.uk/">ROTA – Race on the Agenda</a> and<a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/campaigns-blog/anti-racism-network"> Amnesty International Anti Racism Network</a>, to better educate myself and to get involved in ways to counter the racism that perpetuates across our society. I would ask that, if you are tired of racism rearing its head again and again, you do the same.</p>
<p>A final thing in case any disinformation is spread by the far-right about me. My family settled in the UK 70 years ago. I was born and raised here. I work full time. I come from a Punjabi Sikh background. I am British.</p>

			<p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio known mainly for the God of War franchise, might be working on a brand new IP. Fans have been speculating as much for a while, given that Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-cory-barlog-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> his desire to create a new franchise after he successfully directed the enormously successful God of War reboot. At the time, Barlog stressed he'd need to convince Sony first, but a LinkedIn resume of a Sony Santa Monica Character Supervisor (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/according-to-a-developer-at-santa-monica-studio-the-studios-next-game-is-a-new-ip.943911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on the ResetEra board) suggests he succeeded in his endeavor.</p>
<p>This developer worked on both God of War and God of War Ragnarok before leaving to join Striking Distance Studios to make The Callisto Protocol. Next, they worked for Unknown Worlds on an upcoming installment in the Subnautica franchise before coming back to SSM:</p>
<p><em>Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as Character Supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing Characters in videogames together.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cory Barlog did <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> direct the most recent God of War entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnarok</a>, which launched in October 2022 to critical and commercial acclaim. Barlog only worked on it as a producer, so he might have already been cooking something else. As such, the new intellectual property might not be too far away from being revealed.</p>
<p>It's anyone's guess at this point what that might be about, though rumors suggest it might be set in a sci-fi setting. Whatever they're making, fans will surely be eager to learn more, given Sony Santa Monica's excellent pedigree. We'll keep you abreast of any further rumors and/or official news as they appear.</p>
<p>By the way, God of War fans should not fret: the Californian studio surely is not abandoning its prized IP. On the contrary, they appear to have set up separate teams to handle two franchises at once.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NZXT Function 2 Review: Fast, Full-Sized, and Formidable]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-function-2-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nzxt-function-2-review-fast-full-sized-and-formidable.944271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-function-2-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>NZXT perhaps isn’t the most common name you’ll see in the PC peripherals market. It has a fantastic reputation for PC cases, components, and hardware, but did you also know it has a solid lineup of gaming accessories that range from audio equipment to keyboards? I do now – and I recently had the opportunity to trial the pinnacle of NZXT’s keyboard range.</p>



<p>As I put together my NZXT Function 2 review, I found myself falling in love with this relatively unassuming but ultimately very powerful and capable keyboard. Read on to get the full scope of this mid-range, full-sized, and versatile Function 2 keyboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-light-touch-heavy-potential">Light Touch, Heavy Potential</h2>



<p>The NZXT Function 2 is an attractive enough keyboard at first blush, particularly in white, but when you plug it in, it comes to life. The RGB that runs under the ‘lightning fast’ keys and switches is bright and customisable with the NZXT CAM software, which is brilliant for a gamer with a penchant for <strong>pretty lights</strong>.</p>



<p>On the topic of those lightning-fast keys, NZXT has done brilliantly integrating proprietary optical switches with a linear motion into the Function 2. They’re some of the lightest keys I’ve ever used – but they are adjustable, if you prefer something a little heavier. They’re also hot-swappable, and in the box, you’ll find some extra switches that you can use to test-run something different. </p>



<p>I’ve found that on <strong>some </strong>rare occasions, I’ll press a key and it’s such a light touch that it’ll register the input more than once, but it’s not an issue for me.</p>



<p>This keyboard feels blissful to type with – I’m using it now to write this NZXT Function 2 review. It’s relatively quiet, the doubleshot PBT keycaps feel nice to the touch, and the massive 8,000 Hz polling rate means that inputs are so sharp and reliable.</p>



<h2 id="h-feeling-practical">Feeling Practical</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s function by name and functional by nature. On the Function 2, everything I look for in a keyboard is present, even if some of the location choices are a little strange. For instance, there’s a Windows lock key, a mute button, and the RGB control button all located on the left-hand side of the keyboard, and I find that I keep accidentally pressing them when I’m moving the keyboard around to get comfortable.</p>



<p>This is also where the volume roller is, and while it feels nice and responsive, I’m used to it being in the top-right of the keyboard, which is where most competing products tend to have it located. Instead, the top-right of the board is simply home to the status lights and an NZXT flash. There are also media controls located on shared keys, taking up spots on the PrtSc, ScrLk, and Pause keys.</p>



<p>One of the biggest wins with the NZXT Function 2 is the wrist rest that comes with it. It connects to the keyboard via a couple of magnets, and instead of being cushioned, it’s topped with a harder-wearing, grippy rubber surface. It feels much more durable than the faux leather and plastic wrist rest you tend to get with Razer keyboards, for example.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-nzxt-function-2-good">Is The NZXT Function 2 Good?</h2>



<p>It’s great – I love using mine for working rather than playing because I prefer a TKL keyboard, but this is still a solid device for those with a little more space to play. It’s flawless for typing on, which matters to me, and the RGB and style of the keyboard are nice, but I don’t think I’d price it quite as high as it’s on the market for. </p>



<p>Presently, you’ll need to pay around £139.99 to <a href="https://nzxt.com/en-GB/product/function-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">secure an NZXT Function 2</a>. That does make it more affordable than the Razer Deathstalker or Huntsman, the Logitech G815 or the G713, or the SteelSeries Apex Pro, among many others, so that’s an advantage.</p>



<p>My opinion? If you can secure it in a sale, it’s well worth buying – but if you don’t mind paying the premium price, then there’s no reason why I couldn’t recommend it <strong>now</strong>.  </p>

            <p>Humble Games' last release before the studio was "restructured" last week, Bõ: Path of the Teal Lotus, has launched a Patreon to support the game "in these uncertain times".</p>
<p>Writing on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, developer Squid Shock said that whilst it did not fault the team's work, Humble's changes "have meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support, which may put our studio's future at risk".</p>

<p>Squid Shock also revealed that within hours of Humble's news breaking, it "lost access to the pipeline of critical systems without warning". Whilst it still manages the game on Steam and was able to push out a patch, "the same can’t be said for consoles".</p>
<p>"At the time of writing we still do not have that pipeline restored," the team admitted.</p>
<p>"It has been a hectic two weeks since we launched our first game Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. We are delighted with the overall reception Bo has had, and we’re already responding to player feedback to further improve the experience," the team said.</p> <div>

<p>"Despite this, our launch was not without its challenges, our publisher shutting down has meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support which may put our studio’s future at risk. We want to make it crystal clear that this was in no way the fault of the Humble Games team we worked with. It is just a sad time in the industry and ultimately, we understand," the statement continued.</p>
<p>It confirmed that it was currently taking "steps" to restore access to its console editions, and as it began as a "community endeavour", it was turning to its community again to help secure its future via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/squidshock">Patreon</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">several Humble Games employees took to social media with reports of layoffs</a> at Humble Games.</p>
<p>"At 9AM this morning," business development manager Nicola Kwan wrote in a post on LinkedIn, "36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down".</p>
<p>In response to those initial claims, a Humble Games spokesperson later confirmed "restructuring" at the company, but insisted it was "not shutting down". Former employees, however, intimate otherwise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Faker is one of the most iconic and instantly recognisable esports competitors in history. He’s a master of his craft and one of the best League of Legends players to ever exist, having won the World Championship three times and picked up countless other trophies along a career that has spanned more than a decade.</p>



<p>It’s well-known that he takes losses hard and that he’s very judgement of himself but following a recent loss against Gen. G in the LCK, his stresses became more publicised than ever before. With Gen.G picking up the win, Faker stepped back and started aggressively headbutting a wall before being restrained by his teammates.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-at-the-top">At The Top</h2>



<p>Faker boasts a prestigious position as one of the greatest esports players ever, but it’s a stressful position at best. </p>



<p>He’s considered the face of League of Legends by many, and as one of the highest-paid and most successful players in the world, he has to <strong>constantly </strong>be at his best both in and out of the game, and it’s a trend he’s had to maintain for a decade. It comes as no surprise that a single loss is enough to set him spiralling, but his outburst of frustration has fans concerned.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip that’s doing the rounds:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Recently, Faker won the League of Legends category at the Esports World Cup with T1 after a year of close finishes that saw the team fall in second or third place in the MSI 2024, and some LCK tournaments.</p>



<p>Faker is by no means ‘washed’ as some of his critics would claim – he’s not even a year outside of his most recent LoL Worlds win and he’s looking sharp for the upcoming World Championship event that’s taking place in London between September and November.</p>

<p>That’s not a headline I thought I’d write today. Recently, Adin Ross confirmed that he’ll be appearing on stream with Donald Trump and that the two of them will be opening Counter-Strike 2 cases, of all things. It was claimed by Ross that the two will appear on stream together on August 5, and it’s expected that it’ll be a fairly controversial stream, knowing how Adin Ross likes to behave. </p>



<p>Presently, Donald Trump is running for President and attempting to secure his second term in office. Recently, he was the victim of an assassination attempt that took the life of an innocent bystander.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-trump-cs2">Trump + CS2 = ???</h2>



<p>Adin Ross has been toying with the idea of hosting Donald Trump on stream for several days. However, until the man himself makes an appearance, it’s important to take that with a pinch of salt. </p>



<p>Last year, the inflammatory streamer promised to host Kim Jong Un on stream, but it turned out to be a lookalike performing an impression of the North Korean leader.</p>



<p>It’s not an impossibility, though – Donald Trump recently joined Logan Paul on stream. Admittedly, Logan Paul is more prolific than Adin Ross, but it’s not a massive leap – he is after all the biggest streamer on Kick.com.</p>



<p>Would you be interested in watching Adin Ross interview Donald Trump on stream?</p>

<p>In a recent report published by a Brazilian outlet attending ChinaJoy 2024, it was claimed that a Phantom Blade Zero developer had some harsh words for the Xbox ecosystem. It was explained by the developers of both Black Myth: Wukong and Phantom Blade Zero that they <strong>don’t </strong>have exclusivity agreements in place with Sony – they just don’t see the need to bring their games to Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-a-bit-harsh">That’s a Bit Harsh</h2>



<p>Per the <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on the Brazilian outlet</a>, when an S-GAME developer was questioned on the platform distribution of Phantom Blade Zero at ChinaJoy 2024, part of their response was scalding:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nobody needs this platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://icon-era.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-developer-on-xbox-version-no-one-needs-this-platform.13484/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Icon-Era’s John Elden Ring</a> for the source</em></p>



<p>The anonymous developer was talking about Xbox. Reportedly, they went on to say that the console platform isn’t popular in Asia – which is true – and that Microsoft has made it tough to develop games for the Xbox Series X|S by creating ‘a very overloaded ecosystem.’</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong is being released on August 20 on PlayStation 5 and PC, while Phantom Blade Zero is assumed to be dropping in 2026. I’ve linked these two titles here because both S-GAME and Game Science were at ChinaJoy 2024, and the Brazilian article makes it clear (from the developers) that while both games aren’t being released on Xbox, it isn’t because they have secured an exclusivity deal with Sony.</p>



<p>They just don’t feel that anyone needs the Xbox platform – which is a pretty inflammatory thing to say. However, it’s no big secret that Microsoft’s hardware sales are falling and the team looks intent on relying on streaming and cloud-based solutions, so who knows, perhaps even Xbox doesn’t need Xbox.</p>

<p>Recently, a slew of leaks revealed countless tidbits about Black Ops 6, including maps, modes, killstreaks, movement mechanics, and more. The game, which is set to be released in October, has been blown wide open by these leaks, but Activision is hot on the heels of those sharing images online, issuing strikes against them and taking the clips and pictures down from social media sites.</p>



<p>One particular leak that has fans excited was a screenshot taken on what is obviously a Warzone map. This image (which has now been pulled by Activision) shows ‘Avalon’, the Warzone map that’s dropping later in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-first-verdansk">First, Verdansk</h2>



<p>In just a few months, we’ll be back in Verdansk for the first time since December 2021 – provided you don’t count Warzone Mobile. It’s not yet known if it’ll be a reimagining of the classic map or a dive back into the vanilla experience, but time will tell. It’s expected that this will be a ‘return to form’ for the player base, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we exclusively reported</a> on the internal goal at Activision to follow in the footsteps of Epic Games bringing back the ‘OG’ Fortnite map.</p>



<p>Avalon, <span>the internal codename for the massive map coming&nbsp;<strong>after&nbsp;</strong>Verdansk, was recently shown</span> in leaks.</p>



<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>In addition to the below, we’ve also seen <a href="https://x.com/wealthygamesx/status/1819838141160939607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a clip that shows a player flying high</a> above the map, giving us a broader view of the entire landscape. From an outcropping of smaller islands separated by water to a city centre of sorts that offers an urban location amid the mostly rural map, it looks like this environment is fairly similar to Caldera.</em></p>



<p><em>As the player traverses the map, we see satellite stations and military installations alongside residential districts, a port area, and some old, ruined points of interest. There is a little farmland, a golf course,  and a huge stadium.</em></p>



<p>It was a simple image that showcased a player standing on what looked like a small island off the coast of a somewhat foggy, potentially rural location. Fans quickly pointed out that the new map has <strong>a lot </strong>of water and open space, which isn’t something they’re actively seeking in a Warzone map – but that’s Avalon.</p>



<p>Avalon’s expected to arrive in December 2025 with whatever Call of Duty game comes next.</p>

<p>In my experience, gaming chairs often come and go for one reason or another. Perhaps the lumbar support isn’t right, the seat base isn’t wide enough, or it develops too much wear or an irritating creak after a few weeks of heavy usage. That’s right, I’m a <strong>big </strong>gamer in more ways than one – and that often reflects in the gaming chairs that I opt to use. </p>



<p>I’ve been fortunate enough to review one of the best gaming chairs I’ve ever sat on – the Noblechairs Hero Black Edition. This sumptuous, sturdy seat is one of the finest elements of my setup; a reliable foundation that supports me for several hours a day. </p>



<p>In this Noblechairs Hero Black Edition review, I’m going to break down why it’s just so good.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-about-the-noblechairs-hero-black-edition">What’s New About The Noblechairs Hero Black Edition?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let me open this Noblechairs Hero Black Edition review by stressing that I’ve got my hands on something <strong>really </strong>special – a custom-printed seat. It’s a new service offered by Noblechairs, and it’s phenomenal. I simply posted my images and the team expertly applied them to the back of this wondrous chair. The result is a high-quality, long-lasting, and bright print that stands out nicely against the deep black of the hybrid leather.</p>



<p>That’s where we’ll kick this off – the leather.</p>



<p>The Noblechairs Hero Black Edition uses a unique cover made of vinyl and polyurethane. It’s soft to the touch, doesn’t make you sweat, and you won’t stick to it in even the warmest weather. It feels super durable, and it’s wrapped around a cold foam cushioning that doesn’t relent, even after hours of use. If you pair all that with the velour and memory foam cushions that come in the box, plus the borderline military-grade aluminium and solid steel frame, you’ve got a seat that’s as comfortable as it is dependable – even if you’re looking for the best gaming chair for large people.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-full-features-of-the-noblechairs-hero-black-edition">Full Features of the Noblechairs Hero Black Edition</h2>



<p>I cannot praise this chair enough. It’s wide enough to support a larger frame, and the ‘racer’ style back simply opens up to accept you and welcome you to your new home. The soft-topped armrests are 4D, which means you can adjust them to suit your exact needs, and the integrated lumbar support is adjustable to match the curvature of your spine.</p>



<p>It’s heavy and chunky as all hell, but that’s a good thing – it’s indicative of the robustness of this chair. I previously owned a Noblechairs Hero Edition and it lasted me three years before I moved on to something else – and even when I moved on, the chair was in near mint condition, aside from a little wear to the custom design (it was a Fallout-themed chair).</p>



<p>Let me stress again – if you’re looking for a gaming chair for bigger people, you cannot sleep on the Noblechairs Hero Black Edition. It supports a maximum user weight of 330 lbs (150 kg) and everything from the gas lift mechanism to the levers that you use to adjust the chair just feel <strong>so solid</strong> and high quality.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-noblechairs-hero-black-edition-worth-it">Is The Noblechairs Hero Black Edition Worth It?</h2>



<p>It’s time to wrap up this Noblechairs Hero Black Edition review.</p>



<p>Is this gaming chair worth the £399.95 asking price (before shopping costs)?</p>



<p>Absolutely – it’s without a doubt the best gaming chair I’ve ever used. It’s supportive, soft, breathable, and most of all, it’s <strong>comfortable</strong>. It accommodates people of all sizes but is perhaps best suited to those with a larger frame, and the custom printing that Noblechairs offers means it’s one of the best chairs for esports players and teams.</p>



<p>It’s easy to assemble, simple to maintain, and you’re unlikely to need to repair it, even after months of use. It’s noble by name and noble by nature – if you’re in the market for a new chair, consider the <a href="https://www.noblechairs.co.uk/en-gb/hero-series/black-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Noblechairs Hero Black Edition</a>.</p>

            <p>Activision has banned over 65,000 players across Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.</p>
<p>The bans rolled out in the last few hours, purging thousands of  "cheating and boosting" players from both Ranked and non-Ranked play alike.</p>

<p>If that sounds like a lot, it's not really, given the size of the Call of Duty playerbase. As one commenter said in <a href="https://x.com/SquishyRSX/status/1819519876614311970">reply</a> to the tweet above, "65k accounts seems so small... I just feel like there's so much more…"</p>
<p>ICYMI, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is now available on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers will have access to all Modern Warfare 3 modes, meaning its single-player campaign, multiplayer, and open-world Zombies. It's only the second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> title to hit Game Pass since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the company</a> last year, with Diablo 4 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">launched for the subscription service</a> back in March. It's not the only announced Activision title for Game Pass, of course; this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">available to subscribers</a> when it arrives on 24th October.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">hosting a multiplayer open beta this September</a>, with those eligible for early access (which includes Game Pass subcribers) able to hop in one week prior.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The World Series of Warzone is set to descend upon the realm of Call of Duty once more this year, and it’s looking bigger than ever. This time around, the legendary battle royale-based tournament is headed to Las Vegas, Nevada. It has been a busy few months as teams have fought to qualify for the Global Finals, which is the event taking place in September, but now, each of the 40 teams is locked in and raring to go.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-schedule-and-format">World Series of Warzone Schedule and Format</h2>



<p>The World Series of Warzone will run from September 14 – 15, making it quite a short tournament compared to other, similar events in the space. It might only be a rapid-fire competition, but it boasts a sizeable prize pool of $1 million. This prize pool is split accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>$50,000 – SOLOYOLO Tournament</li>



<li>$950,000 – Trios Tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s quite a confusing format for the World Series of Warzone, though.</p>



<p>Players will compete on the first day of the Global Finals in <strong>six matches</strong>, their placement in which will determine their seeding for the second day (or ‘point advantage’). On day two, the teams will face off in an intense showdown with a ‘match point’ format. That means that once a team reaches 100 points (there are no match limits), they’ll need to win one more match to secure the grand prize.</p>



<p>That means that you could theoretically have ten teams over 100 points and sitting on ‘match point’, but it’s that final win that decides who takes home the trophy.</p>



<p>There’s a $300,000 prize reserved for the number one team.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-teams">World Series of Warzone Teams</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a pretty insane list of competitors making their way into the arena for the World Series of Warzone Global Finals. Here’s the full breakdown of the 40 squads fighting for the top spot:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aydan, DjMas, zSmit</li>



<li>GabeKuun, Flanked, Blazt</li>



<li>Natedogg, Rxul, Destroy</li>



<li>iVisionSR, KingAJ, V8 Showstoppxr</li>



<li>Prxdigy, Oekiy, Echo</li>



<li>Niasen, KingChawk, NydaahSavage</li>



<li>LilMario, Lonnerdd, Clowhn</li>



<li>Colony2k, WatchWaldo, TBC</li>



<li>ZaaKK, HalloW, Ayzen</li>



<li>ZDark, Amir, Castillo</li>



<li>Biffle, Soka, Shifty</li>



<li>HusKerrs, Braalik, Jackal</li>



<li>Ottereyes, Empathy, SuperEvan</li>



<li>LouiCM, WarsZ, Bubblect</li>



<li>Begsy, SV, Reload</li>



<li>Stewo, Enxiun, Patzukka</li>



<li>Slide, BeamArk, Jtecc</li>



<li>RobStar, Wartex, Blade</li>



<li>Roocket, Qlapr, Zachar</li>



<li>Padrin, vitiin911, Reaper</li>



<li>Braxtvn, Yungstaz, JujuSaiyan</li>



<li>Braxtvn, Yungstaz, JujuSaiyan</li>



<li>Sage, Adrian, Swagg</li>



<li>Crmz, Xink7, HMoodX</li>



<li>Klavsen, ilgooy, FLS</li>



<li>SavyUltras90, isFreddy, Dsyre Zanx</li>



<li>Babahuf, FutureHasGame, AlmightyTJM</li>



<li>Boogs, Benzei, Stukex</li>

<li>Melvin, cPentagon, Fuzzn</li>



<li>Javiix, Dagat1, Camz</li>



<li>E700, Fundsy, Tea</li>



<li>Jukeyz, Lenun, Fifakill</li>



<li>Netodz, XtraJ, Vitaah</li>



<li>xmq, Hassi, Tikqs</li>
</ul>



<p>I warned you – it’s a massive list of Warzone competitors.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-predictions">World Series of Warzone Predictions</h2>



<p>Last year’s tournament win went to Biffle, Shifty, and Sage, and this year, everyone is holding out hope that the majority of that squad can pick up the two-time, back-to-back win. This time around, Sage has slipped in with Swagg, and Biffle and Shifty have picked up Soka, a Polynesian player who wound up sitting in second place last time around.</p>



<p>My money is on Team Biffle – this crew breezed through the Warzone category at the Esports World Cup. If the team can win big at the World Series of Warzone, they’ll be catapulted into the history books as some of the biggest earners in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-esports-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty esports</a> history.</p>

<p>New details and images of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have started to leak online ahead of the mode’s official reveal.</p>



<p>The leaks come courtesy of Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/betterthanalaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@betterthanalaix</a>, who’s seemingly been able to gain backend access to Black Ops 6 ahead of the multiplayer BETA and final release.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, the Twitter account has already leaked all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-mutliplayer-maps-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6’s 20 multiplayer maps</a>, in addition to details on Gunsmith, killstreaks, perks, weapons and more.

<p>You can see the leaked images/gameplay below:</p>

<p>It’s not entirely clear how the user gained access to the game, but judging from the material leaking online, the nature of the screenshots suggests that they were able to access the game via the COD HQ or an old build. At the time of writing, though, this is the only account that has seemingly got access.</p>



<p>The leaks come ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CODNext</a>, which is scheduled to take place on August 28th, 2024. CODNext will feature multiplayer reveals ahead of the game’s multiplayer BETA. In addition, it’s also been confirmed that CODNext will feature Call of Duty zombies, but as reported previously by Insider Gaming, Warzone may not be there due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk not returning until Spring 2025</a>.</p>



<p>For the first time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-officially-announced-for-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 will be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass</a>, thanks to Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. </p>

<p>A Black Ops 6 multiplayer map list has leaked online detailing all 20 multiplayer maps that might be coming to the game.</p>



<p>The leaks come courtesy of Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/betterthanalaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@betterthanalaix</a>, who’s seemingly been able to gain backend access to Black Ops 6 ahead of the multiplayer BETA and final release.</p>



<p>According to the Twitter/X user, here are 20 maps that will be coming to Black Ops 6.</p>

<li>Pillage </li>



<li>Radar </li>



<li>Stealth </li>



<li>Nuketown</li>
</ul>



<p>As those familiar with past Call of Duty titles may recognize, some maps are seemingly from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops title, but most of them seem original. </p>



<p>The Twitter account has also begun to individual upload images of all the Black Ops 6 maps.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 will launch on the Xbox Series S|X, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation5, and PC on October 25, 2024.</p>

    <p><span>New chapter features Qingyi, Jane, and Seth.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Undercover R&amp;B,” will launch on August 14, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-903363"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Version 1.1 will feature the new challenges soon to be faced by New Eridu Public Security (N.E.P.S.) and the complex story between Qingyi, Jane, Seth, and the criminal syndicate known as the Mountain Lion Gang. Aside from updates to the story and new characters, Version 1.1 will also introduce the new Hollow Zero gameplay experience “Inferno Reap,” where players can jump into battle with Nineveh directly. Also, the New Eridu Public Security area at Lumina Square will be open to players. Furthermore, with various events such as Camellia Golden Week, abundant rewards are awaiting inquisitive Proxies.</p><p>In Version 1.1, Zhu Yuan, Qingyi, and Seth will utilize their talents to fight a battle of wits and courage with the Mountain Lion Gang. However, these criminals always manage to escape arrest with the help of the enigmatic Jane. By further immersing themselves in the world of Special Episode “Undercover R&amp;B”, Proxies will be able to stroll around New Eridu, complete commissions as Jane, and uncover the intricate past between her and N.E.P.S..</p><p>As Proxies become more familiar with New Eridu Public Security (N.E.P.S.), Qingyi will be ready to join players’ squads. As an S-Rank Electric Stun character who can fit in a variety of different squads, Qingyi is skilled at inflicting Daze quickly to stun enemies. While Qingyi’s attack causes electric damage, she can build up “Flash Connect Voltage,” triggering a powerful attack once it reaches a certain level. Being Zhu Yuan’s trustworthy partner at N.E.P.S., Qingyi can also offer significant support to Zhu Yuan in combat.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_903364"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Assuming a crucial role in Version 1.1’s storyline, Jane’s relationship with the player will be that of both friend and foe. As an S-Rank Physical Anomaly Agent, Jane can trigger “Passion State” by building up Passion Stream, unleashing rapid, multi-stage, and deadly attacks while quickly inflicting Attribute Anomaly on enemies. However, before she joins the players’ squads, Proxies will face Jane as an enemy in combat due to her status as an important member of the Mountain Lion Gang. You can certainly count on her agile combat skills, but you might not feel the same when you are on the receiving end.</p><p>Beyond two S-Rank characters, the A-Rank Electric Defense character Seth is also ready to join combat. Aside from buffing his teammates with a shield, Seth’s weapon can also transform into a large sword he uses to defeat enemies. In addition, new S-Rank Bangboo “Officer Cui” will be able to assist Proxies in the Hollows.</p><p>In addition to regular updates to Shiyu Defense, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is introducing new gameplay “Inferno Reap” to Hollow Zero. After completing the “Withering Garden” stage and related commissions, Proxies can enter a time-limited battle with Nineveh. The challenge can be attempted as many times as possible. Successful challenges grant a wide range of in-game rewards.</p><p>In Version 1.1’s themed event “Camellia Golden Week”, Proxies can obtain Polychromes, A-level W-engine, and various materials by completing event commissions. Additionally, a variety of new in-game events and features such as Immersive Tactical Drill, First-Class Customer Service, and upgraded camera function with filters and selfie options will offer players fun new ways to enjoy the game!</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,578 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,794 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.1 trailer and special program below.
