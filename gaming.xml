            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to work through some issues I have with the way I approach playing &amp; beating video games. For the longest time, I’ve felt like I need to make sure I see every possible piece of content in a playthrough of a game – and that drive to avoid missing anything often leads to me turning games into a checklist of tasks and a monotonous guide-assisted slog. Sometimes, missing out on an item or a boss in a game can be punishing – but punishment and frustration aren’t bad things to experience when gaming. Like any piece of art, entertainment might not always be the goal. Like real life, you’re always bound to miss out on something, somewhere. Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered has ended up becoming the perfect exposure therapy for me to remind myself of and embrace these qualities, and enjoy this one-of-a-kind open-ended RPG experience with no hesitation or remorse.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1pisy3s/romancing_saga_minstrel_song_remastered/">[Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered International] Now out Physically and Digitally on PS4, PS5, and Switch. New localization options (French, German, Italian and Spanish), and option to select the Japanese dub with Eng subtitles. No save transfer from the previous release.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VashxShanks/">u/VashxShanks</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/">JRPG</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I love a non-linear story, and I love a story with an ensemble cast who slowly come together in unexpected ways. Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered is built on both those qualities – you have eight different protagonists to choose from who each start in a different part of the massive world of Mardias. You have vague knowledge of the fact that there is a massive evil stirring somewhere in the world, and that there are ten mysterious objects scattered across Mardias that could potentially be gathered to fully revive this evil. </p>


<p>When you pick your starting hero, though, you aren’t given any immediate quest related to this or any clue on how it all connects back to you. You’re simply thrust into a living world, and given the opportunity to explore it and take things one step at a time until you come across companions, and clues, and quests, and eventually an ending.</p>


<p>I love this so much. It can be a little daunting at first, but it really gives you the tools to tell yourself your own story as you play the game – there is no consistent pacing, or expected encounters, and it all kind of plays out like a tabletop RPG campaign. I especially loved the feeling of unexpectedly encountering characters that can be recruited to the party. Alongside your eight primary heroes, dozens of other characters live in the world who can join your quest. Sure, there are probably some incredibly optimized playthroughs you can put together if you follow a guide on where to recruit the best party members. For me, though, it was so rewarding to stumble upon each of them, and even sometimes lose some of them, in a natural way.</p>
<p>The combat encounters and gameplay that tie these moments of immersive and emergent storytelling together are, admittedly, pretty basic. Battles are standard turn-based RPG encounters, with the most unique wrinkle being the fact that you’ve got weapon durability to be concerned about as you adventure. There are a lot of new abilities and skills for your characters to learn as you progress through the game, and plenty of equipment options for putting together specific character builds and battle styles. Honestly, though, it wasn’t the thing that kept driving me to play the game. If you happen to feel otherwise and have a passion for the battles, though, there are a wealth of optional bosses and extra challenges to dig into.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of new content in this remaster compared to the original PlayStation 2 release. A huge amount of it is quality-of-life stuff that makes the simple act of playing way, way smoother. Almost all of the extra non-QoL content is relegated to endgame and additional playthroughs. As a newcomer to the game, this didn’t stand out to me much. Reading about the content in detail, though, it seems like the kind of thing only a minority of players will ever encounter. </p>

<p>One element is an expanded story arc for a particular newly recruitable character, Aldora. Seeing that content to it’s conclusion, though, requires making specific choices across three playthroughs. There’s also a set of new ultra-difficulty bosses that, similarly, you’ll need to be pretty deep into your first or 2nd playthrough to be prepared to fight. It’s definitely a significant amount of new content, but the main game doesn’t feel any kind of lacking despite all of these elements being so deep into the game.</p>
<p>There’s a few elements of Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- that I wish were remastered just a bit better, though. For one thing, the lack of camera control is a frequent issue. Without full control over the direction of the camera, it can be a headache to navigate the more complicated dungeons of the game – especially when the camera ends up moving on its own and muddying my sense of direction even further. </p>
<p>The visuals of the game are also just a pinch away from perfect. I appreciate the weird, almost bobblehead aesthetic of the character models, even though I’m sure some people will end up fully disliking them. There’s a weird disconnect though, where the high-fidelity and resolution combined with the stylized models and just-slightly-blurry textures don’t all fully come together too well. It’s mostly the kind of thing where I imagine the fuzziness of the original version and the CRT you probably would have played it on tie the magic of the art style together.</p>

<p>Flaws aside, Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- is an incredible experience. It bucks traditional game design ideas that seem like no-brainers or bare minimums. However, the lack of a traditional main quest or even a standard linear story make for the kind of game that you end up falling so deep into that it ends up being your own story that you end up crafting, instead. Hopefully this remaster helps this game get seen as the classic it deserves to be.</p>

<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across The Unknown</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>18th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Daedalic has shared a "Combat Deep Dive" (above) from developer gameXcite to mark the occasion. Pre-orders are available now, and it's also been confirmed that a demo – which is up now on Steam, PS5, and Xbox – will make its way to the Switch 2 "soon". The demo is inspired by the pilot episode 'Caretaker' and contains roughly one hour of gameplay, including a guided tutorial.</p>
<p>A Deluxe Edition will also be made available for pre-order, containing the following additional content that will be integrated into the main campaign: "new missions, new recruitable heroes, and powerful technologies drawn from pivotal alien encounters in the Delta Quadrant".</p>
<p>According to the official description, Across the Unknown "blends exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices. Experience crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe — with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities."</p>
<p>It sounds like it might be the perfect thing for fans of the series, but we'll have to wait and see for sure when it launches next month.</p>

            <p>Minecrafty fantasy sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> will finally launch into early access today, a few months after being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">rescued from cancellation</a> by Hypixel server co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme. In development for over a decade, it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-devs-hope-to-redefine-the-block-game-genre-with-their-world-generation-and-theyve-now-explained-how-it-works">a bid to “redefine the block-game genre”</a> that features procedurally generated biomes and RPG-style dungeon delving. Unlike the earliest instalments of Minecraft, it will also ship with some pretty fleshed-out lore.</p>
<p>In a post on the official site, the dev’s lore meister “Joe” has shared a few thoughts on the game’s flexible ideas about canon. Naturally, a lot of the chat invites comparison with other games with mighty codices, from The Witcher to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a>. I’m indifferent to much of Hytale, I confess - I have exhausted my lifetime's supply of enthusiasm for blocks, and in any case, I prefer the drearier tone of <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story</a> - but on this count, I’m quite intrigued.</p>
<p>Joe <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/a-look-at-hytale-s-lore-and-philosophy">begins by noting</a> that Hytale had a lot of concept art, earlier in development, much of which has been dropped over the years in the course of narrative redrafts and other changes of direction, including the discarding of entire factions. However, “since the re-acquisition, many of these changes have been rolled back or re-incorporated in different ways”. This is partly because the developers “have made the conscious decision to return to an earlier draft - one that's far more compatible with the engine we're shipping and the vision we have for the game as a whole.”</p>
<p>In general, the chaos of past year has obliged a hard-headed approach to the narrative convolutions. Certain bits of lore have been shelved, some of them for good, while other materials are being revived. Take various initially “divisive” redesigns for the insectoid, desert-dwelling Scaraks – “with the timeline we're shipping on and the fact that the new designs aren't usable in-game, we can't exactly throw out the old ones anymore,” Joe writes. The devs are working on a method of “bringing both into the lore and making them work”.</p><p>In general, the new draft of the narrative retains “the major aspects of the lore the community has come to love over the years,” Joe goes on. “Characters such as Gaia and Varyn are still very much a part of our canon, and Tessa and Kyros are coming back as well”. The devs also intend “to revisit the concept of Alterverses”, these being parallel planets or dimensions – the main one is Orbis, which looks a lot like Earth.</p>
<p>In general, Hytale’s developers want “to maintain a consistent and coherent narrative while also allowing experimentation. Joe argues that “lore should not be a strict set of rules that everyone on the team is required to follow when designing content”, but “a set of guardrails to ensure we don't get too far off track”.</p>
<p>Hytale has certain fixed “canon foundations”, and the forthcoming Adventure mode will impose more of a narrative. But as regards the initially released Exploration mode, they’re leaving it pretty open. The game will encourage a degree of player “archaeology” that “gives us the flexibility to tell stories from different perspectives, many of which may not share the same understanding of Orbis and its nature”. As you might expect, these clashing perspectives may be faction-based.</p>
<p>As for when Adventure Mode might arrive, Joe cautions that there are currently “no systems in place to support such an endeavour, and there has never been a version of the game that had anything close to a narrative implemented. Even the details of the story itself have never truly been finalized.” So it’ll be up to you dig up the roots, for the moment. There is “a narrative of sorts” in Exploration Mode, tethered to a change in the world generation – Joe ends this section by dropping hints about something called Cursebreaker.</p><p>While a lot of the language here is too fluffy and promotional to get your teeth into, I think Hytale’s evolving lore could be fun to analyse. The early days of Minecraft were a series of improvisations and occasional mishaps <a href="https://archive.org/details/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009">discussed on IRC</a>, with minimal suspicion of the massive financial success that would follow – according to Notch, the game’s now globe-straddling Creeper mascot began life as a botched attempt at making a pig.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Minecraft is an absurdly bulky narrative universe, albeit a whimsical one that is rather less supportive of pedantic overreactions than, say, Star Trek. Hytale is sort of trying to follow the same trajectory, surfing the chaos wrought by last year's almost-cancellation, but with the more explicit hope of becoming a behemoth, and I think that puts the backstory writing under interesting stress. What do you reckon?</p>
<p>If you're sold on Hytale, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">how and when to buy and download it</a>. The game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">won’t release on Steam for the moment</a>, because Hypixel are worried about negative reviews from people unfamiliar with the choppy development history.</p>

              <p>At the very end of 2025,&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> developer CD Projekt Red announced it had sold its long-running PC gaming store GOG to CD Projekt and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński. And while Kiciński launched GOG with its anti-DRM ethos, he’s been away from both companies for the last 13 years, and it was unknown if he might take the now independent storefront in a new direction. According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, there are no fears of GOG backing down from its bold stance, even if it means missing out on lucrative AAA gaming sales.</p> <p>Then known as Good Old Games, the store was originally launched by Polish developer CDPR in 2008, with a focus on selling classic games that had become hard to get hold of, stripped free of old, decaying digital rights management software. As the store developed, it began selling newer games too, but always on the condition that they shipped without any form of DRM.</p>

 <p>In the late 2000s, DRM had become the cause of a huge amount of controversy, with games shipping on DVD-ROM with ludicrous, game-breaking restrictions, such as limits on how many times they could be installed, the inability to run fully installed games without the discs in drives, and most insidiously, online checks that meant games couldn’t be played without an active internet connection. Ostensibly in place to prevent the illusory threat of “piracy,” these restrictions only ever prevented legitimate game owners from playing their games freely, while pirated versions were usually stripped of all DRM by the first day of a game’s release. It was a farce. (And it still is, with DRM software in digital games now severely impeding performance.) GOG has been run for the last 18 years with a refusal to sell DRM-infected games.</p>

 <p>It’s good to know that time hasn’t changed Michał Kiciński’s position on the matter. Speaking to&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em>, the new outright owner of GOG explained that after a bidding process against an unknown rival company, he succeeded in buying the company he created because he sees “opportunities” for the business. GOG made very little money for CDPR, but Kiciński believes there’s a route to more financial success, and he’s not exactly unambitious.</p>

 <p>“I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow,” Kiciński says. “And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80 percent of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me it’s the opposite. I see: ‘Oh, there is one big competitor, it’ll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80 percent, so it should be easier to take the market from them.”</p>

 <p>The focus to try to do this is not to try to out-Steam Steam, but rather to “just be better at a certain segment.” This is the site’s focus on classic games, but also working with independent developers with big-game games who are willing to sell via GOG. Citing games like&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, which were simultaneously released on GOG alongside Steam, it proves that outside of the mega-publishers, there are those willing to embrace GOG’s ethos. Oh, and as part of the sale it was agreed that CDPR’s games will remain on GOG for at least the next six years—that certainly helps.</p>

 <p>When it comes to refusing DRM, Kiciński tells&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em> that it remains “a core value of GOG, and there’s no signs that it might die in any visible future,” describing this as both an ethical and pragmatic choice. And, with a refreshing frankness, he says he has no time for publishers who don’t get it. “Most corporate people, they make plain stupid decisions.”</p>

 <p>You can read the rest of the interview, along with details over whey the company was sold and its plans for the future, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">over on&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Built to improve Wi-Fi performance in large homes, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router delivers faster speeds and more reliable connectivity. With the addition of an extra 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6E expands on the two bands (5 GHz and 2.4 GHz) that have been standard in routers for years, giving each device more space on the airwaves and reducing congestion. The combined speeds of all three bands reach up to 5400 Mbps, enabling smooth, uninterrupted 4K and 8K video streaming while you continue browsing the Internet, chatting, and downloading files on other devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">The TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router is now available on Amazon for $116, down from its usual price of $200, for a savings of $84, or 42%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful router to improve your home Wi-Fi connection</h2>
<p>With the added 6 GHz band in the tri-band Wi-Fi 6E on the Archer AXE5400, there are three independent paths for traffic, making it ideal for applications such as gaming, video conferencing, or high-bitrate video streaming, where interruptions can be frustrating. Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and laptops typically run on the 5 GHz band, while smart home devices and general web surfing can use the 2.4 GHz band.</p>
<p>This router has true tri-band capabilities and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), so it can communicate with multiple devices simultaneously rather than waiting for each device to connect one by one. It also includes a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor and 512 MB of RAM to handle heavy traffic, especially when many devices are accessing the Internet simultaneously.</p>



<p>In addition to delivering the performance gains of Wi-Fi 6E, the router also offers advanced network security features that enhance protection and control. HomeShield tools included with the router include: basic network scans, identification of new devices connecting to the network, built-in Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, and reporting to display network usage patterns over time. There are also basic parental controls and WPA3 encryption, providing an additional layer of security for compatible devices compared to WPA2-based equipment, as well as support for both a built-in VPN server and a VPN client to protect your traffic or securely access your home network from remote locations.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router works with major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including but not limited to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Xfinity, Spectrum, Cox, CenturyLink, and Frontier. However, most cable and DSL connections require a separate modem, which must be purchased separately. The router itself provides Wi-Fi, plus wired Ethernet WAN and LAN ports, and a USB port for supported accessories so that you can mix wired desktop computers with wireless mobile phones and streaming devices. Plus, the TP-Link Tether app lets you set up the router from your smartphone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">Once operational, the router’s relatively small size makes it easy to fit next to your modem, and its $116 sale price is a better value than the $200 original list price.</a></p>

<p>Hytale feels like the spiritual successor to Minecraft in many ways, and it could be one of the big games over the next few years. Its early access release has been met with various questions, including whether Hytale includes controller support or not.</p>



<p>The tension building for Hytale’s thought-impossible launch has been seismic. After getting the green light to continue production in mid-2025, Hypixel Studio has been working hard on an old build to ensure the game is in a good state for early access.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-has-secured-development-costs-for-the-next-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale has secured development costs for the next two years</a>, which is great, but it could mean nothing without controller support for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-use-a-controller-for-hytale">Can You Use A Controller For Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale doesn’t support any form of official controller support for its early access launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you struggle with a mouse and keyboard, you might come unstuck at times trying to negotiate Hytale. The developer has been very transparent over many of the details surrounding Hytale’s early access build, and the official website has even addressed the question of controller support.</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://hytale.com/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Accessibility</a>, here’s what the information has to say.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are currently missing controller support.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, there’s no second-guessing if you can hook up a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S pad to play Hytale—you can’t, and it’s unfortunate, as it will ultimately exclude a handful of potential users.</p>



<p>On the plus side, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-being-added-to-hytale">When Is Controller Support Being Added To Hytale?</h2>



<p><strong>Hypixel Studios has said that controller support is a “top priority” that the team is looking to add ASAP.</strong></p>



<p>You might have to hang fire just a little bit for controller support. From the sounds of it, you might not be waiting too long. Once again, let’s check in with the game’s Accessibility page:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This [controller support] is one of our top priorities and is expected to be available soon after release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>How soon is ‘soon,’ is anyone’s guess. It could be a week or a month. Time is relative here and affects different groups of players. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale expecting one million users during the early access launch</a>, stability and a structurally solid framework could be the goal at first.</p>



<p>Hopefully, controller support arrives in the time it takes to get stomped on by a dragon in the game’s world.</p>



<p>Is a lack of controller support at the early access launch a big no-no for you? What other key features is Hytale missing for its debut? Share some ideas via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, and start up some Hytale conversations.</p>

Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?</p><p><strong>“What if?” Scenarios</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently? If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?</p><p>Wonder no more: <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> allows players to take control and shape the journey of the U.S.S. Voyager as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your <a title="Genres > Action [3,324 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s! The game features <a title="Genres > Roguelike [407 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.</p><p><strong>Deep Ship <a title="Genres > Management [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a> and Research</strong></p><p>After being moved forcefully into the Delta Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager ends up heavily damaged and in dire need of repairs as well as internal reconstruction. Restore destroyed rooms, secure life support and energy supplies, and start constructing. Ship systems, crew quarters, industrial and research facilities: You must decide what to build and when, to ensure the ship has what it needs for the perilous journey.</p><p>Expedite research into different fields. New technologies and improved layouts will not only strengthen the ship but also boost your crew’s morale. Exotic and dangerous research, like the technology of the Borg, is also within your reach. As captain, will you embrace it for the potential it offers, or will you omit it for the dangers it presents?</p><p><strong>Exploration and Resource Acquisition</strong></p><p>The dangers and opportunities of the Delta Quadrant beckon to be discovered by you and your crew. Scan celestial bodies to locate precious resources that fuel your journey. Find points of interest and oddities along your way, but beware: While the Delta Quadrant may reward the bold, it punishes the careless just as quickly. As captain, you have the final say in plotting a course and defining an approach.</p><p><strong>Ship Combat and Away Missions</strong></p><p>The journey of the U.S.S. Voyager would not be possible without both combat between ships and away missions to planets or space facilities.</p><p>For away missions, put together a team based on the individual talents of your crew. A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots. Minimize the risk for the team’s members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach—you decide.</p><p>When diplomacy fails, the U.S.S. Voyager and its crew are ready to enter ship combat at your command. From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry. And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>“What if?” Scenario and Storytelling</strong> – The ultimate platform to play out your course of action during the iconic journey of the U.S.S. Voyager.</li><li><strong>Complex Ship Management</strong> – Repair, construct, and maintain an efficient and habitable ship to ensure systems and crew operate effectively.</li><li><strong>Exploration and Decision Making</strong> – The Delta Quadrant is a fascinating yet perilous place that awaits exploration and demands decisive action.</li><li><strong>Combat and Away Missions</strong> – Use the talents of your crew smartly to minimize risk during away missions as well as strike boldly during ship combat encounters.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Combat Deep Dive</span></h2><p><iframe title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Combat Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-adds-switch-2-version-launches-february-18]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Forza Horizon 6 was announced in 2025, Microsoft said it would come to PS5 after the Xbox and PC releases, but the company did not say what the exact gap would be. As for Fable, there is no word yet at all about a PS5 release, but it would be little surprise, given the belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">Microsoft will release all of its big games on PS5.</a></p><p>When Fable was delayed to 2026, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delay-into-2026-could-allow-it-to-release-on-ps5-at-launch-leaker-suggests/1100-6529719/" data-ref-id="1100-6529719">the delay could allow the game to release on PS5 alongside the Xbox and PC versions.</a></p><p>Fable and Forza Horizon 6 will be shown off at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">Xbox Developer Direct on January 22</a>. During the showcase, Playground will provide an "extended look" at Fable, which is notable because Microsoft has shown so little so far. Forza Horizon 6, meanwhile, will get a debut of the first gameplay footage.</p><p>Microsoft puts some of its games on rival systems like PS5 to help them reach more people, and to bring in more money. It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-xbox-game-just-passed-300-million-in-revenue-on-ps5-report-says/1100-6537323/" data-ref-id="1100-6537323">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5 passed 5 million units sold and $300 million in revenue.</a></p>

                <p>Nexon has officially announced that Arc Raiders has sold more than 12.4 million units since the $40 game launched at the end of October 2025. The sales number is not a surprise, as the research firm <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">Alinea Analytics previously estimated sales to be around 12 million. </a></p><p>Nexon president and CEO Junghun Lee said sales at this level, along with the fact that Arc Raiders reached 960,000 peak concurrent players, demonstrates "the potential for Arc Raiders to become another pillar in Nexon's portfolio of blockbuster franchises."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The Korean publisher, which owns the Arc Raiders IP and developer Embark, further stated that Arc Raiders passed 10 million units sold by the end of December 2025. Nexon said sales accelerated recently, presumably due in part to the game's 20% discount, pushing total figures to 12.4 million and counting. The game has sold well and still has lots of players, as the game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-were-the-top-15-most-popular-games-last-week-in-the-us/2900-7295/" data-ref-id="2900-7295"> regularly ranks at the top, or near it, on the Steam charts.</a></p><p>Anyone who logs into Arc Raiders by the end of today, January 13, will get the "Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool" as part of the game's new update today.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634592" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634592"></a><figcaption>Get the Gilded Pickaxe for free right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4634592-golden.jpg"></figure><p>This update makes a series of significant changes, including reducing the fire rate for the Kettle from 600 to 450. "The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using third-party software," Embark said.</p><p>Additionally, the Trigger 'Nade has been nerfed. "This nerf aims to make it less usable as a 'trigger-in-air' grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb," Embark said</p><p>What's more, the new Arc Raiders update fixes an exploit with key cards that allowed players to retain the room keys even after using them.</p><p>Given the huge success of Arc Raiders so far, it's no big surprise that Hollywood has come calling. Embark has said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">gotten TV and movie pitches</a>, but no deals have materialized as of yet.</p><p>Arc Raiders has been big hit, but it's also been criticized for its use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-my-game-of-the-year-but-its-use-of-generative-ai-really-sucks/1100-6537140/" data-ref-id="1100-6537140">AI-based text-to-speech systems</a>. Patrick Söderlund, the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark, recently shed more light on the situation, saying the studio's goal in implementing AI into its development processes is to make better games more efficiently. He also pushed back against the idea that using AI systems in game development would lead to lower employment at Embark.</p><p>"We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors," Söderlund told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a>. "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/" data-ref-id="1900-6418435">Arc Raiders review</a> scored the game a 9/10. "We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played," reviewer Mark Delaney said.</p>

                <p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has clarified his statements regarding X's AI generation of nonconsensual sexual images of minors and women, saying he merely "criticized a government official" for pressuring publicly traded companies for attempting to "block a speech app owned by their political opponent."</p><p>Right around the January 9 weekend, news broke that X users were turning to Grok, the platform's AI tool, to <a href="https://www.404media.co/groks-ai-csam-shitshow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create images of minors and women</a> in sexually compromising outfits and positions. The situation drew the attention of US Senators Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Edward Markey (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), who <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_apple_and_google_on_removing_x_and_grok_from_app_store_192026pdf.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote a letter to Apple and Google</a> requesting that the companies remove the Grok and X apps from their app stores for the "mass generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of women and children." The senators have asked for a written response from both companies by January 23.</p><p>In response to the letter, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/senators-apple-google-remove-grok/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MacRumors reported and shared on X</a>, Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009732745140871463" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quoted the post on January 9 and said</a> that senators using their political power to remove these apps for the harm they have caused are "gatekeepers" who are trying to "censor all of their political opponents." He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009753835456156088" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continued in a follow-up post</a>, explaining that no major AI company is "perfect" because they all have "documented instances of [their tech] going off the rails" and that these companies "make their best efforts to combat this." These comments blew up, drawing criticism from some corners of Elon Musk's social platform and praise from others.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer ran a story on January 11</a> criticizing Sweeney for what it described as a defense of "an unprecedented online sexual humiliation machine," Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the outlet's reporting</a>, calling the story a "vile lie" that misconstrued his statements.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is a vile lie by PC Gamer.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steams-big-new-zombie-game-is-tense-but-comes-at-a-bad-time-2000658992</link>
            <guid>1404442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I screwed up real bad in my first few in-game days of the latest Steam hit, <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint.</em> I let an infected person into the safe zone of our military-run camp. They turned into a zombie overnight, and I woke up to dead survivors. The reason I let them in? Right now, the last thing I want to do is hand off random citizens to soldiers in masks who will take them away to get “liquidated.”</p> <p>Before you email me or screenshot this article and share it online, let me be very clear: <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">I know I’m breaking the rules</a>. I know I’m not supposed to talk about the real world when writing about video games. That’s a big no-no. To dare connect the dots between a digital game and the real world we all live in is often seen by some of the loudest online as a cardinal sin. Unforgivable. Well, get over it because I find it genuinely impossible to write about<em> Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> without addressing the current state of America.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">In <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint,</em></a> out now on PC, you play as a commander who has just arrived at a hastily put-together military installation in the middle of New York City. Your job is to help make all the big decisions on this base, including managing resources, upgrades, and the health and safety of personnel. But most of my time in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> was spent manning a single entry point at the front of the base, where survivors crawl out of a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested city in the hopes of finding shelter, food, and medicine. But first, they have to get past me, the asshole with a flashlight and gloves who decides who lives and dies.</p>

 <p>The majority of<em> Last Checkpoint</em> revolves around operating that point of entry. Early on, you are equipped with a flashlight and a small list of various symptoms and injuries to look out for, like bites and bloodshot eyes, and must use that list to determine who is healthy enough to enter, who needs to hang out in a quarantine cell for a few days, and who might need to be taken over to a non-descript room just out of eyesight of everyone to be shot in the head. As the in-game days go on, you start getting new tools, like a rubber mallet to check reflexes, and an X-ray gun to scan for hidden bites.</p>

 <p>In my first few days, I avoided sending anyone to the kill room. I’ve spent the past few months watching President Trump’s jackbooted thugs in masks, aka ICE, grab people off the street, sometimes at gunpoint, and take them away to places none of us can see. Not everyone comes back. And as I played <em>Last Checkpoint,</em> my phone was filled with photos and videos from out of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv7knz8e8mo">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2000-federal-agents-sent-to-minneapolis-area-to-carry-out-largest-immigration-operation-ever-ice-says">where ICE continues to cause mayhem and destruction</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/09/nx-s1-5672502/minneapolis-portland-ice-shootings">even shooting an innocent woman in the face in broad daylight</a>. So the armed guards decked out in full masks and carrying large assault rifles in<em>&nbsp;Last Checkpoint</em> were hard to trust.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659009" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659009"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659009">©Brigada Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But eventually, as space in quarantine ran out and I sent a few too many infected people into the safe zone and got others killed, I had to start sending people away to get shot in a room for the good of everyone else. There is no cure for the zombie plague in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em>, so once you think someone is infected, there’s not much of an option left. Each time I’d send a survivor away, I’d wait for the message to pop up on the screen confirming whether they were infected or not. When I finally screwed up and realized I’d sent an innocent man to his death at the hands of gun-toting soldiers, I wasn’t sure if I was having fun anymore.</p>

 <p>Tracking symptoms and managing a small military base in the middle of a zombie apocalypse using various tools and having to make hard calls is a very tense experience. And when I could disconnect what was happening in <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Checkpoint</em> from the world I currently live in, I found myself having a good time succeeding at helping people, something the game also rewards you for and makes clear is the main goal of all this. But then I’d check my phone and see what <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-immigration-enforcement-children-tear-gas-border-patrol-rcna241629">government-controlled soldiers are actually doing at a time when we aren’t being eaten alive by zombies</a>. The in-game soldiers and officials in <em>Last Checkpoint</em> have more restraint and empathy during a zombie apocalypse than the authorities walking our actual streets do right now. Wild shit.</p>

                <p>It's no secret that a video game based on 2008's The Dark Knight was in development at one point, before the plug was ultimately pulled. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-footage-for-batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-surfaces-online/1100-6522392/">Footage of the game</a>--which was being developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/">by the now-shuttered Monolith Productions</a>--has surfaced online over the years, and this week, a new video showed how this Batman adventure would have taken a cue from the live-action films with its dynamic soundtrack.</p><p>As part of a treasure trove of materials uncovered by retro games enthusiast and archivist Mar Talida, the footage showcases early cinematic footage, game design documents, concept art, and much more. If you have an ear for video game soundtracks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbadrp5ek2v" rel="nofollow ">there's even video of the game's dynamic audio system</a> and how it would change depending on the situation that players found themselves in. Batman live-action films have had iconic soundtracks, and Monolith's game used some of Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight soundtrack to demonstrate this feature.</p><p>It's worth noting that all of this content came from very early in the pre-production of the Batman game--codenamed Project Apollo--as the assets were dated to around 2009-2010 and naturally look rougher than the 2024 leak.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcba4da5xk2x" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiexnglfrkoagem3zaekq35capabq2ux3cwacqlek5gdc2hwzn35la" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>I've recovered a cache of documents and videos from the pre-production phase of Project Apollo, a canceled Batman game Monolith worked on for Warner Bros.

  </div><p>While the project was eventually scrapped and elements of it were used to develop Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its signature Nemesis System, Batman fans weren't left out in the cold thanks to Rocksteady's popular Arkham series of games.

Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>, and DC studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a> in the future.</p><p>Fortunately, Batman returns later this year in Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.

While the company still hasn't released pricing info for the SteamOS-based hardware, it has shed some light on its verification process in a new interview with Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Valve designer Lawrence Yang, developers hoping for a "Steam Machine Verified" badge can expect "fewer constraints" than Steam Deck Verification. "One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine," Yang continued. VR developers seeking Steam Frame verification may expect a different process, though Yang said Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" as it does for the other verification programs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "Steam Deck Verified" badge has proven to be more than a mere quality assessor when releasing games on Steam.

            <p>Who mods the mods? A bunch of people, or so was the hope of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON when they released their total conversion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> back in 2024. So far, there've been plenty of tweaks and smaller scale additions to the mod's version of the post-apocalyptic English capital, but no new quests or world expansions of note.</p>
<p>Things playing out that way to this point - despite Team FOLON having <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-british-fallout-making-of-interview">been very open in encouraging other modders</a> to have a go at making such creations - is something Fallout: London project lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter's clearly aware of, and he's offered a few theories as to why it might be the case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are definitely some cut quests which are not planned in any of the DLCs that could have been implemented, which we have voiced, but that just wasn’t in the scope of what we could do before we moved on as a company," Carter told <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/industry/fallout-london-creator-bethesda-elder-scrolls-vi-fallout-5-gta-london/">Esports.net</a> in a fresh interview. "If a modder wants to get involved in them, they absolutely can. That’s what we’d love to see. We’re modders at the end of the day. We’re never going to say no to other modders wanting to do stuff."</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that, while his team have chatted with "quite a lot of smaller modders", there hasn't been a deluge of folks wanting to flesh out the massive mod with their own extra quests or adventures, as is the case with all of the pro studio-made modern Fallouts. Instead, a glance at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4london">Fallout: London's Nexus Mods page</a> - which I've kept an eye on regularly to see if these sorts of ambitious or creative works pop up - currently turns up just over 600 mods that generally provide handy tweaks to mechanics or fairly compact additions like player homes. There are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/17">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/613">few</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/461">mods</a> by a creator called WitherAwayyy I've dug up which could fit the expansion bill, but they remain exceptions to the rule.</p><p>"I’ve heard of people who have been looking into it, and we give advice and help if they ask, but I don’t know of any new worlds or spaces coming up," Carter admitted in this chat. That's no huge issue - Fallout: London's plenty good played in its 'vanilla' state, as Carter reckons a lot of potential modders may simply prefer. That said, it's still an intriguing thing to see play out, given I can't think many other mods off the top of my head which have offered such an expansive opportunity for modding on top of modding.</p>
<p>Though, at this juncture Carter reckons that may well have been another of the limiting factors the mod's modding scene has bumped up against. "I think people are also well aware that, given the nature of how large we built an entire game on top of another game, it’s not the easiest to mod, and there are stability issues that come from building a game on top of a game," he said. The modder also reckons Fallout 4's age has played a role. "It’s a modding scene for a decade-old game. I think a lot of people have moved on," he theorised. "Even ourselves, when you go back to that question of would we do more, the answer is probably not in Fallout 4."</p>
<p>While this may be one area in which Fallout: London simply can't mirror the Fallout entry to which some have compared what the sort of detour it offers Fallout players - Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> - there are still a couple of bits of free Team FOLON-made DLC yet to arrive for it. Last Orders is the first of these and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-next-dlc-last-orders-will-be-served-up-early-this-year-if-current-pint-pulling-plans-hold">should arrive pretty soon</a>, followed at some point down the line by a Yes Man-esque questline in the Wildcard DLC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-laptop-at-nearly-60-off-comes-with-windows-11-pro-and-microsoft-office-priced-like-a-budget-tablet-2000659048</link>
            <guid>1404415</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If high laptop prices have been holding you back from upgrading, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">The 15.6-inch HP business laptop is down to $400 at Amazon, after a massive 56% or $500 discount on its usual $900 price.</a></p>
<p>The bundle includes a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, and a recovery USB. Delivery is free, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the overall cost down even further. But as you’d expect, the discount is around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last longer than a day, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expandable Memory and Storage</h2>
<p>For just $400, you’re getting a sleek laptop that features a nice 15.6-inch Full HD display. With a resolution of 1920 × 1080, the screen delivers crisp details and vibrant colors for an immersive viewing experience. The anti-glare coating keeps it easy on the eyes, allowing you to use the laptop comfortably in all lighting conditions. Working on an important work presentation or just catching up on your favorite show, expect vivid, sharp visuals consistently.</p>
<p>The machine is powered by the latest Intel Core i3-1315U processor that features 6 cores (2 performance cores + 4 efficiency cores) and 8 threads to deliver fast, efficient performance. Intel Turbo Boost Technology helps it reach up to 4.5 GHz, meaning you can rely on the laptop for everyday work tasks, plus casual use (browsing, streaming, checking emails, communicating). Paired with the laptop is a modest 8GB RAM, which keeps everything running smoothly at the backend. It’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask, but here’s the good part – the memory is expandable up to 64GB. That means you can always upgrade as your needs grow. The same is the case with the 628GB SSD (128GB SSD+500GB external). It’s sufficient to house important files, work documents, and media content, but the PCIe NVMe SSD supports capacities up to 2 TB. If it ever feels tight, you expand the capacity to keep the system running smoothly.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re covered with Ethernet (RJ-45) for speedy wired networking, an SD card reader, USB-C, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI output, and a headphone/microphone combo jack. That’s more than enough to create a productive setup for both office and studies. You can add external drives, and even connect another monitor if you need more than one screen.</p>
<p>Freebies add even more value to the bundle. You’re getting a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, which offers access to efficient apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and more. You will also enjoy 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage, handy AI features, and other useful tools that make remote productivity and creativity a breeze. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, which means you can get started with using the laptop right away. And finally, there’s a WOWPC recovery USB in the bundle, which offers quick and convenient system restoration in case of software issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">This future-proof HP laptop is now sitting at just $400 at Amazon.</a> It’s practically nothing considering all the features the machine is packed with. We highly suggest grabbing it as soon as you can before the price shoots back up to $900.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970</link>
            <guid>1404412</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tom-clancys-the-division-the-kotaku-review-1766431754"><em>The Division</em></a> came out nearly a decade ago. You can still go and play it but it hasn’t received a meaningful update since 2018. That could all be about to change. Marketing for “<em>The Division: Definitive Edition</em>” recently appeared in Japan suggesting the Tom Clancy-branded loot shooter could be getting a modern version to bring players back into its snowy, post-apocalyptic New York City.</p> <p>A mural advertising the unannounced version was spotted at the <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2010224815131766796%7Ctwgr%5E03918b0436fb66d4f458378427f25deceae49e55%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fit-looks-like-the-division-definitive-edition-is-on-the-way-10-years-after-its-initial-release">FPS Day X esports event</a> where Ubisoft shared other info about the franchise, like a new “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zo5k8xkeHs">Realism Mode</a>” for <em>The Division 2</em> that will make the RPG play more like a traditional shooter with quicker time-to-kills and other more lethal tweaks. The first <em>Division</em> game originally launched back in March 2016, so it’s likely that whatever this Definitive Edition is could become available in just a few months.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FPSDayX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FPSDayX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDivision2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheDivision2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%93%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B32?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ディビジョン2</a> <a href="https://t.co/1ySkfSb98B">pic.twitter.com/1ySkfSb98B</a></p> <p>— Domen🐻Gaming | ドウメン (@domen0204) <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>What a Definitive Edition would actually entail has been the subject of much speculation over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1q9ywr5/the_division_definitive_edition_spotted_at_fpsday/"><em>The Division</em> subreddit</a>. Will it be a current-gen remaster that brings the game natively to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S? <em>The Division 2</em> never got one, making that theory seem unlikely to some. Others would be happy if the game simply got support for 60fps on console and other quality-of-life improvements. Some fans have also suggested the possibility of new story content, or the merging of certain mechanics and modes from the current game back into the older one.</p>

 <p>Of course, it’s very possible that what Ubisoft might mean by a “Definitive Edition” is that it’s bringing all of <em>The Division 1</em> and <em>The Division 2</em> into a single cohesive package. That would seemingly be a much bigger undertaking and it’s hard to see exactly how it would work. The second game’s Warlords of New York added the first game’s location, but there’s still a ton of missions, story, and other content that could make its way there. A single package would also make it a more obvious candidate for a Switch 2 port.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division</em> seems to be doing exactly what <em>Destiny</em> fans keep begging for</h2> <p>Assuming that whatever this Definitive Edition is, it brings the old game forward for new and returning players to enjoy fresh in 2026 in some way, developer Massive will be fulfilling the dream that many <em>Destiny</em> fans have had ever since <em>Destiny 2</em> wrapped up its big, 10-year story arc with <em>The Final Shape</em>. While Bungie has brought some of the best parts of the old game forward into <em>Destiny 2</em> over the years, it also ditched most of the sequel’s original campaign to make room for ongoing expansions.</p>

 <p>A perennial request of fans is for the Red War and other cut content to return. Another pie-in-the-sky wish is for the old <em>Destiny</em> to return in some “vanilla” form similar to<em> World of Warcraft Classic.</em> It would be the original game but with a visual overhaul and on modern platforms so that players feel like there’s a reason for everyone to go back at the same time. The third request you’ll find in the replies for almost any new announcement from the <em>Destiny</em> social media account is for Bungie to simply start fresh and make <em>Destiny 3</em>.</p>

 <p>https://x.com/blueberriesGG/status/2010713900975902762</p> <p>Those are all very tall orders for a studio that’s suffered tons of layoffs, cuts, and player attrition in recent years, especially as it works on getting its new sci-fi shooter, <em>Marathon</em>, out the door alongside ongoing <em>Destiny 2</em> updates. But this is kind of what fans of <em>The Division</em> are in for right now. Executive producer Julian Gerighty recently teased that <em>The Division 3</em> is “<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489">shaping up to be a monster</a>.” In addition to its recently revealed Realism Mode, The <em>Division 2</em> is also getting its delayed Survivors mode later this year.</p>

 <p>If this Definitive Edition of the original game doesn’t disappoint, fans of the apocalyptic shooter will be eating well. <em>Destiny 2</em> fans might even be envious. Something they’ve never had much reason to feel before, if ever.</p>

<p>A whole cache of documents and footage from the cancelled Monolith Batman game has surfaced online, showcasing audio systems, character art, game mechanics, vehicles, and more. </p>



<p>Footage and other details about cancelled Batman games have been surfacing online for quite some time now. Last year, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-concept-art-cancelled-batman-game-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concept art</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potential-footage-for-canceled-damian-wayne-batman-game-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">potential footage</a> from the cancelled Damian Batman game by WB Games Montreal. Now, much more footage has been released for Monolith’s title, along with additional details.</p>











<p>The cache of footage and documents for the cancelled Monolith Batman game comes through a series of posts by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrTalida on BlueSky</a>. The bulk of the footage was part of “internal-facing and Warner Bros.-facing pre-production milestone deliverables”; however, some files are from an actual build. </p>



<p>The first set of videos discusses the dynamic audio system from the cancelled Monolith Batman game, showcasing how the music reacts and transitions as the player moves in and out of stealth, enters combat, and plays quests. </p>







<p>Then we get to see an example of cloth physics, showcasing how Batman’s cape moves around while walking. We also get to see character art for Gordon and members of the Gotham police, along with a facial animation test. </p>







<p>We were also shown other game mechanics from the cancelled Monolith Batman game, including the caped crusader throwing Batarangs to knock enemies down, using smoke bombs to enter stealth, knocking enemies down, using detective mode to collect evidence, and more. </p>







<p>The last video shows the Tumbler Batmobile in action, maneuvering through various sets of obstacles, using its boosts, and ramming into other elements on the map. Readers should note that this is very early footage, from 2009 to 2010. More files and documents are available <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>











<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has been announced.

The years since have revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-and-hellblade-developer-ninja-theory-built-an-ai-called-muse-designed-to-generate-ideas-for-a-games-design-and-its-already-making-complex-gameplay-sequences">the studio has been working with Microsoft's generative AI model Muse as part of a project that's generate clips of simulated gameplay</a>.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"You guys shouldn't expect Project Mara to be a thing," Corden claimed. "Project Mara was just a concept, it's not a game — and it's not a game they're currently working on. It might be something they work on eventually, but Project Mara is not a game that's currently being worked on at Ninja Theory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Corden has since doubled down via <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2010993531037302935" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> on his claim that Project Mara was "only ever a concept" rather than a full game — so therefore "the game wasn't cancelled." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2020, Ninja Theory <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/01/22/ninja-theory-announces-project-mara/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> Project Mara as "our new in-development experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling." To date, there's been no further word on what became of the concept or why it was seemingly been abandoned. Last year, it was publicly confirmed that Team Ninja's colourful co-founder Tameem Antoniades had quietly left the studio, something that Microsoft only acknowledged to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a> after his absence was noted on a press visit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Microsoft for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>French publisher Ubisoft is promising a nostalgic 2026, with remakes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> nearing completion, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">the first Division game also getting a re-release</a> of sorts. For many of the developers at key studios, however, the year is off to an awful start.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft's Halifax Studio was promptly shuttered</a> only weeks after unionising. The true motives behind the closure were unclear, but we had reasons to question Ubisoft's short comments on the matter, especially after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">everything going on at Rockstar Games</a>. Some voices online pointed out the developers were maybe seeing a closure coming, and thus prepared to face it with better protections. Today, that theory seems stronger, as Ubisoft continued to take "additional steps" <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-offer-voluntary-redundancies-to-massive-entertainment-staff">following the "voluntary career transition program" offered last year</a> to Massive Entertainment staffers.</p>
<p>The new layoffs, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, have (at the time of writing) translated into 55 roles being cut across the Massive Entertainment and Stockholm teams. Massive's plans for the immediate future haven't changed; the studio will continue to work on the new content coming to The Division 2 this year, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-ubisoft-dev-says">the seemingly massive threequel</a> (and probably that "definitive edition" of the first game).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-fire-and-ash-player-boost">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora received a stunning third expansion DLC</a>, probably marking the end of substantial support for that game. Last year also saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-pc-graphics-comparison">Star Wars Outlaws being (excellently) ported to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. With those games "out of the way" now, one can see, without downplaying the horrible human cost, why and how Ubisoft is streamlining operations at Massive as it faces uncertainty in spite of the big reorganisation around its core franchises through a subsidiary <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/es-es/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios">announced in October 2025</a>.</p><p>Before the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-announces-restructuring-proposal-for-redlynx-60-jobs-may-be-at-risk">RedLynx also faced aggressive restructuring</a>, so this awful news is just a continuation of a company-wide trend that might continue well into 2026. Outside the aforementioned remakes and re-releases, Ubisoft's next 12 months are looking a bit too quiet, so there could be a lot riding on those blasts from the past.</p>

            <guid>1404385</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although very little is known about <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a></em></strong> other than that it is in the works and it is coming out at some point, the community is obviously excited about the next entry in the series. However, as it's already been almost 15 years since the launch of the celebrated <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, expectations are incredibly high, so much so that they have put the game in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, according to a former Bethesda employee.</p>



<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview">Esports Insider</a></strong>, former <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Lead Artist&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile</strong>,&nbsp;who worked on&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;76,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Skyrim</em>, commented on the next entry in the series and the challenges it is already facing during development. Expectations for both the game and Fallout 5 (which is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/">unlikely to return to the series' roots</a></strong>, according to Fallout New Vegas lead developer Chris Avellone) are very high, and Purkeypile believes they have put both games in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, alongside Skyrim being widely considered as one of the best games of all time.</p>



<p><em>"How do you beat that?"</em> he said. <em>"And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone,"</em> <strong>Purkeypile</strong> continued.</p>



<p>The massive fan expectations are putting major pressure on <strong><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong>, and, according to <strong>Purkeypile</strong>, <strong>Bethesda</strong> will take all the time needed to deliver the best possible game. <em>"I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls VI out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that,"</em> the former <strong>Bethesda</strong> lead artist elaborated.</p>



<p>The long time it's taking for the game to launch, however, has nothing to do with waiting to see <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a></em>'s</strong> reception. <em>"I’m sure there’s plenty of audience overlap and all, but just because one game flops doesn’t mean another will necessarily. There can be a whole bunch of reasons that happen."</em></p>



<p>Although a slightly different game, there's no denying that the reception <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> received when it launched in 2023</strong></a>, which hasn't really improved over time with the release of free updates and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a></strong>, could definitely be putting more pressure on the development team to deliver the best possible RPG, and the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"ultimate fantasy simulator"</strong></a></em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard</strong> himself teased last year.</p>

PC makers like Lenovo and HP have been stockpiling memory, but those stockpiles will likely run out in a few months time and lead to increased prices and potentially even PC configuration changes.</p><p>“Beyond the obvious pressure on prices of systems, already announced by certain manufacturers, we might also see PC memory specifications be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” says Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice president at IDC. “The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile.”</p><p>IDC is now expecting average selling prices of PCs to rise in 2026 as PC makers shift priority to midrange and premium systems to offset the higher costs of memory. All of this points to an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/858505/pc-market-ram-nand-ssd-gpu-pricing-notepad">AI-driven storm for the PC market throughout 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>It wasn’t April Fool’s Day when Nintendo announced a big, new update for </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>—but mid-20s programmer Lemmy still thought it was a joke. His girlfriend sent him a link on Instagram, and he thought it was a fake announcement. He went straight to the source: Nintendo, where he realized that yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>Nintendo </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> releasing a new update for the five-year-old game</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s 3.0 update and Switch 2 upgrade for </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>will be released on January 15, the first big update to the game since 2021. </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> is far from a dead game, but its massive playerbase—which swelled during the COVID-19 pandemic—has, naturally, fell off. Those of us who spent hundreds of hours on our </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> islands for a year and a half have moved on; many of us haven’t visited our islands since. We’ve left messes on our islands, and remain forever indebted to Tom Nook. With the economy inevitably stalling after we took our “go get ‘em!” industriousness with us, the villagers we left behind have spent the last couple of years fending for themselves.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[My girlfriend and I] played </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> when it released and then I pretty much played it every day for a year, and maybe a little less often for another six months,” Lemmy said. “I think I fully stopped playing it summer 2023.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The new content and quality-of-life improvements it introduces make Nintendo’s 3.0 update the push many players needed to return to the game. But that raises a big question: To nuke or not to nuke? For some players, like Lemmy, the </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update was the perfect excuse not only to return to the game, but also to make a fresh start. “When I saw and heard about the update it persuaded me to restart,” he said. “I did that just before the new year.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000659292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659292">Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Morri Koester, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8BqWN05p7W_TOoFB7d9oA">a YouTube creator</a> who has played</span><i><span>&nbsp;New Horizons</span></i><span> for more than 5,000 hours and built a dozen or so islands, told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that they aren’t making a new island, but are still using the new update “as an excuse to do things differently”—”new year, new me sort of vibes,” they said. Koester has been working on their current island for two years at this point, and unlocked nearly all of the DIYs and catalogue items. The big reason they’re not doing more to totally overhaul their island or start anew is because the 3.0 update has a feature that’ll essentially do that itself—Resetti. Resetti’s Reset Service is a quality-of-life feature intended to clear up big swaths of an island; it’ll remove flowers, decorations, and fencing from a specific area. (Everything, including flowers, shrubs, and trees, will go straight into inventory.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My island is a mess because I refuse to do the man’s work for him, but I can’t wait to see that mess just poof into a blank canvas to start my new island theme,” Koester said.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of completely restarting, Koester spent the time between the 3.0 announcement and the update’s release day working on a series of different goals—primarily, prepping to complete the Nook Miles goals they set for themself. The 3.0 update’s bulk crafting mechanic, which lets players craft in bulk straight from their inventory, means it’ll be easier to finish some of the harder Nook Miles tasks. One of the Nook Miles challenges that’s notoriously hard to complete is crafting 3,000 furniture items. Koester is looking to reach this goal in a day when the update is released; they’re collecting coconuts so they can craft nearly a thousand Coconut Juices—a furniture item in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, which requires only coconuts to craft—in a day.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I know everyone has a specific opinion or strategy for preparing for the update, whether it’s cataloguing items or gathering resources, but my personal opinion is to prepare for what is going to give you the most joy in the game,” Koester said. “If that means restarting your island on update day to get the full 3.0 experience on a new island, do that. If that means cleaning out your inventory on your five-year-old forever island, do that! If that means collecting a crapton of coconuts like an obsessive gaming gremlin, do that. Prep is all in the mindset, not in specific gameplay.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Lemmy, meanwhile, has spent the time between the update announcement and January 15 working through the early hours of any new island—opening the museum, saving resources.</span></p> <p><span>“I just wanted a fresh start, especially to experience some of the changes and the DLC with a clean canvas, making use of the new items and features without ripping everything up first,” he told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “My preparation is kind of just that—restarting. But also I’m just saving resources, not worrying about decorating my island or anything yet, and just progressing through the early parts of the game with as little planning as I can.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659000"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659000">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Players that are restarting don’t have to go it alone, though: Lots of players on social media and forums are offering to help support players looking to start over. “I’ve been going on and off mystery islands to collect materials for restart care packages,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pqbpn7/comment/nut7toc/"><span>one person on Reddit wrote</span></a><span>. There’s no right or wrong way to experience a new update, but some players, indeed, do feel pressure to do things the “right” way; lots of players have spent a lot of time on their islands, perfecting every little detail, or rushing to gobble up all the new content.</span></p>

 <p><span>But Koester wants to remind players that even the most seasoned players, like them, don’t necessarily feel prepared.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a big change to the game, with new mechanics, new buildings, new NPCs, and new items,” they said. “Seasoned and new players alike will experience it at the same time for the first time, which in itself is a pretty magical feeling to share. If you’re worried, just know that everyone is going through the ‘new’ feeling, and take it slow. Not everything has to be experienced at once. So no matter what, whether you’re starting a new island, had your island for years, stopped playing for a time, there is no being late to experiencing joy. You’re fashionably on time.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987]]></content:encoded>

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is now available to play in full on PC following release, and symptoms are a crucial mechanic that can make or break your playthrough.</p>



<p>Available on PC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including with a Game Pass subscription</a>, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts you in charge of the entry of survivors into a camp during a zombie apocalypse, and it’s down to you to decide whether a survivor is showing signs of being infected.</p>



<p>Remembering all the symptoms can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with a breakdown on what survivors can show, and the action you should take as a result.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">All Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check are a crucial stage of the game, and processing a survivor incorrectly can quickly lead to disaster, so it’s important to know what each symptom indicates.</strong></p>



<p>You can uncover symptoms by using a variety of tools that are at your disposal, though you won’t have access to all of these immediately upon entering the game, as others are unlocked through progression.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the symptoms available in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and the action you should take with those displaying them.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">How to Deal With Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>



<p><strong>There are three approaches to dealing with survivors in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check. You can either allow them to pass, send them to quarantine, or deny their entry.</strong></p>



<p>The correct choice is uncovered by discovering the symptoms a survivor is showing, highlighting whether they’re safe to pass or risk spreading an infection. If an infection is confirmed, entry should be denied, and if it’s suspected, but not guaranteed, the safe choice is to send them to quarantine.</p>



<p>Here’s an easy breakdown of what to do with each survivor based on the symptoms they show.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Good to Go: </strong>Safe to allow the survivor to pass through the checkpoint.</li>



<li><strong>Possibly Infected: </strong>Send the survivor to quarantine to monitor their symptoms further.</li>



<li><strong>Infected: </strong>Deny entry. </li>
</ul>
