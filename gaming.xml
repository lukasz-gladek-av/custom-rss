The controller releases on June 5th, the same day as the Switch 2, but Nintendo will be making it available to order ahead of that date.</p><p>Initially, the controller will be available to buy from May 8th to May 12th to people who receive direct invitations from Nintendo to buy a Switch 2, according to a footnote on the controller’s listing. Starting May 13th, Nintendo will offer it to people who pay for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Nintendo will limit purchases to one per Nintendo Account.</p><p>The controller looks very similar to the original GameCube one, but the Switch 2 version is wireless and has some additional buttons to match what’s on other Switch 2 controllers. It won’t work with all regular Switch 2 games, though; in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/556487/gamecube-controllers-functionality-switch-1">a statement to <em>Polygon</em></a>, Nintendo said that since the controller “doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games.”</p><p>For the Switch 2, Nintendo will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">offer GameCube games</a> as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. On the Switch 2’s launch date, the GameCube lineup will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>. </p><p><em><strong>Update, April 24th</strong>: Added that Nintendo will limit to one controller per Nintendo Account.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>  <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is Remedy Entertainment’s unexpected foray into the multiplayer shooter genre. Set in the occult office space world of<em> Control</em>, the co-op experience is unlike anything the <em>Alan Wake 2</em> maker has ever done before and it now has a release date. The Finnish studio revealed that <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is out in June and shared details about the game’s battle pass that make it sound very similar to the one in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196860,197541" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Announced during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream with the developers on Thursday</a></span>, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 17 at the price of $40. As previously confirmed, it’ll also be available via Game Pass on console and PC, as well as PlayStation Plus via the Extra and Premier tiers. Most importantly, Remedy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained on Steam</a></span> how the game’s post-launch content will roll out and be monetized. </p><p>Similar to <em>Helldivers 2's </em>Warbonds, <em>Firebreak</em>’s battle passes are called Requisitions. There will be free and paid tiers, each unlocking new weapons, cosmetics, and other items. The “free” Requisitions are purchased with in-game currency while the premium ones are purchased with real money. All Requisitions will also remain permanently available in-game, following the trend kicked-off by <em>Halo: Infinite</em> and others. </p><p>Here’s how the grind works in more detail, per Remedy:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Earn Lost Assets by completing Jobs.</li><li>Spend them to unlock items in any Requisition you have acquired.</li><li>Unlocking items isn’t fully linear; rather, you can choose what you want to unlock.</li><li>You can progress multiple Requisitions at once.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So yes, for anyone who’s played <em>Helldivers 2</em> it should all sound pretty familiar. It makes sense for <em>Firebreak </em>to borrow from that system given both games following a similar session-based PVE gameplay loop. Remedy also confirmed plans for ongoing free post-launch updates in the form of two new missions coming after release, with additional content slated to arrive in 2026. </p><p>But it doesn’t sound like Remedy’s trying to drown players in an endless grind. Instead, <em>Firebreak</em> sounds like live service gaming-lite: it’s not a game you ever really “beat” but it also isn’t meant to feel like a second job, another balancing act <em>Helldivers 2</em> nailed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful.

            <p>
Control fans eager to return to the depth of the Oldest House won't have long to wait. Remedy Entertainment has confirmed its three-player PvE Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, releases for PC and consoles on 17th June, with talk of plenty of post-launch support to come.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">unveiled last October</a>, promising a co-operative take on the Control universe in which players, cast as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak response unit, must keep the Oldest House's numerous paranatural anomalies - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreaks-latest-trailer-brings-extradimensional-furnaces-and-exploding-pink-goo">weird pink goo</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">sentient Post-It notes</a> - in check. Each Job takes players to different corners of the ever-changing building - some familiar and some new - and features different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
Remedy offered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8">another look at FBC: Firebreak in its latest developer livestream</a> earlier today, sharing details about the game's battle-pass-style progression system, Requisitions. These come in two flavours: standard Requisitions, which are free to all players, and premium Classified Requisitions, which must be purchased with real money.

<p>
Standard Requisitions contain weapons, armour, and equipment that can be unlocked using in-game currency earned through play, while items in Classified Requisitions are cosmetic only with no gameplay benefits. Notably, there's no expiration date on Requisitions, meaning players can unlock items in their own time. In addition to Requisitions, Remedy has outlined its post-launch content plans, confirming it intends to release at least new Jobs in 2025, with more coming next year. These will be free to all players.

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that co-op <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is launching on 17th June, dropping onto PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and Epic.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will set you back $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99, but will also be available day one via&nbsp;PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog (Extra and Premium). A Deluxe Edition will be $49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99, or an upgrade for the difference of $10 / €10 / £7.</p>


<p>The announcement came through the April Developer Update which also gave a longer look at a newly revealed mission, Hot Fix, as well as another look at &nbsp;Paper Chase, where sticky notes have been all spookified.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak Developer Update April 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other Jobs revealed so far have also showed&nbsp;a Furnace that spread fire across the Maintenance Sector, needing players to turn on sprinklers and fans to douse the flames, or the pink Exogenic Mass, which explodes if you touch it.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll have some buddies by your side to give you some morale-boosting pats on the back to get back to work. FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op shooter, loosely in the vein of Left 4 Dead. In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.</p>
<p>Playing the game will tap into a system of rewards called Requisitions, which are a free way to unlock cosmetics and gear like weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more using in-game currency earned through gameplay. There will be no limited-time windows or rotating stores, so no FOMO.</p>
<p>Classified Requisitions are the premium counterpart, which can be purchased with real money and will always be purely cosmetic. You can see these with the Deluxe Edition, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Remedy also gave a look at the longer term picture for the game. Post-launch two more missions will be added to the game through 2025, with more updates planned for 2026. All playable content will be free to all players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not long now before we get to set foot back in the Oldest House to blow up small pieces of paper!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/electronic-arts/">EA</a> has announced the release dates for both Madden NFL 26 and EA Sports College Football 26, and confirmed that there will be no Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of both games, leaving behind the last-gen versions five years after the launch of the current generation.</p>
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 will launch on&nbsp;<strong>July 10, 2025</strong> and will be available three days earlier for players who purchase early access through the Deluxe Edition, while Madden NFL 26 will arrive on <strong>August 14, 2025,</strong> and will also be available three days earlier for those who grab the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>If you were already planning on grabbing both games, EA has a<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/bundles/mvp-bundle/buy"> bundle</a> you can grab that'll get you both games when they release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 &amp; College Football 26 Announce Trailer | The Call" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIp9SMjNH1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition for Madden NFL 26 nabs you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 Madden Points</li>
<li>Season 1 Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Cover Athlete Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Superstar Legendary XP Boost</li>
<li>Franchise Coach ability points</li>
<li>Player card exclusive item</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Deluxe Edition for EA Sports College Football 26 gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 College Football Points</li>
<li>Top Prospect Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>All Hands Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>Dynasty Coach Points</li>
<li>Road to Glory Skill Points</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVP Bundle, which is what you'll want to get if you were getting both games anyway, gets you all of the above along with a few bundle exclusive items for either game. If you pre-order the bundle ahead of April 29, 2025, you'll always get the Travis Hunter 99 OVR player item in both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> was a smash-success for EA last year, with the series returning after being on hiatus for a decade. It'll be interesting to see if that same success can be repeated, or even surpassed this year. Sports games are a consistent seller every year, and it's doubtful that the same fans who flooded to buy the first official college football video game in 10 years are satiated by just one new release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another board game developer is scaling back production in response to the volatile global trade environment. CMON, the developer behind works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/massive-darkness-2-hellscape-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Massive Darkness</em></a>, will pause all board game development and crowdfunding projects.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.cmon.com/press/an-update-on-our-internal-teams-and-company-focus/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, CMON posted a brief three-paragraph statement. The statement explains that the company will be immediately pausing all board game development alongside any crowdfunding projects.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cmon-zombicide-board-game.jpg?itok=XkpUnsYH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cmon-zombicide-board-game.jpg?itok=EJ1oFyPk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a result, CMON will be making reductions in creative teams. Though no numbers or specific departments are mentioned, the statement does remark that the employees laid off will be missed professionally and personally.</p>

<p>The reasons given for the tabletop company's major decision is the recent trade tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The industry continues to rapidly evolve, and unpredictable situations like the recent tariffs, or COVID just a few years ago, present challenges for everyone in board games. With that said, it is our responsibility to take these difficult measures to ensure that we can keep current projects on track and deliver them in a timely manner. We will of course resume new development as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China and is then imported back to the US. Due to the trade tariffs, production costs have jumped up exponentially. Since there is no infrastructure to bring the same level of production locally, studios have had to make difficult business decisions in response to this devastating complication to the industry.</p>

<p>CMON is the latest studio to scale down or suspend tabletop game development as a response to the uncertain chaotic trade environment caused by the Trump administration. An environment that has already lead to closures by developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>, online retailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> by Stonemaier Games.</p>

<p>CMON's tabletop game development history is packed with beloved entries. Their catalog includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/song-of-ice-fire-tactics-fully-funded-in-under-7-hours" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tactics</em></a>, localizing several <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japanese TTRPGs</a>, and officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/metal-gear-solid-board-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne</em> board games</a>.</p>

It’ll be available on PC (both Steam and the Epic Game Store), the PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available on subscription platforms Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Set in the <em>Control</em> universe a few years after the original game, <em>Firebreak</em> is a three player co-op shooter where players take on missions inside of the headquarters of the FBC — Federal Bureau of Control — which has become overrun by supernatural forces. “The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability,” Remedy explains.</p><p>The new game will be a paid release, priced at $39.99, and it sounds like it will be a nice change of pace from demanding live-service games. The studio says that, while there are updates planned for after launch, “all future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. ”</p><p>You can see some of the game in action here:</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is part of <em>Remedy</em>’s plan to build <em>Control</em>’s supernatural universe into something much bigger.

On top of that, you'll also be able to take part in online co-op battles through the Red Light Raid mode, teaming you up with players around the world to shake down the seedy underworld of the game's infamous districts.</p><p>One thing to note about this release is that it's a Game-Key Card version. Essentially, this means that you'll still need to download Yakuza 0 onto your Switch 2 and the cartridge will act as an authentication device. Game-Key cards are not tied to your Nintendo account, so if you want to sell the game when you're done with it, it will work fine on a different Switch 2 console. An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you've never played Yakuza 0, then you've missed out on one of the best games that Sega has ever published. Set in 1988 Japan during its financial boom, the game is an origin story for longtime Yakuza characters Kiryu Kazuma and Goro Majima, revealing how they became the legends known as the Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano, respectively. At its core, Yakuza 0 is a 3D beat-'em-up with a heavy emphasis on storytelling, with major beats in the game playing out like episodes of a gangland drama series.</p><p>The game is also packed with diversions, as there are side stories to explore between missions and numerous mini-games to take part in. Kiryu even gets to take part in a side-hustle invests in real estate in Kamurocho, while Goro runs a cabaret club in Sotenbori. Both modes are surprisingly deep, and either one could work well as a standalone game.</p><hr><p>Yakuza 0: Director's Cut is one of several Sega-published games that'll be released for the Switch 2.

In Japan, Nintendo is holding Switch 2 lotteries, where people submit their names for a chance to preorder the upcoming console. The idea is to cut down on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-units-are-already-dropping-on-ebay-some-arent-what-they-seem/1100-6531090/" data-ref-id="1100-6531090">scalpers hoarding systems and selling them at exorbitant prices</a>, and to avoid the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/">chaotic mess of online free-for-alls</a>, but it seems unscrupulous actors are taking advantage of the situation in other ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Some consumers received emails telling them it was their turn to purchase a Switch 2 and directing them to click on a link that would take them somewhere that was definitely not the Nintendo Store.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have confirmed phishing emails disguised as the results of the My Nintendo Store 'Nintendo Switch 2' lottery sale," Nintendo said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1915369995934326801" rel="nofollow ">X</a> (translated via Google). "The lottery results sent today will not include a URL for the purchase procedure due to a change in the processing period. If there is a URL for reservations or purchases, it was not sent by our company. Please be careful."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo of America is hosting a similar, albeit more restrictive, sign-up process where people who meet specific requirements can register their Nintendo Accounts for a chance to preorder a Switch 2 on the Nintendo Store. Nintendo will send an invitation to purchase the system in May, though some may not receive invitations until after the June 5 launch. The phishing attempts tied to the Japanese Switch 2 lottery occasionally used hard-to-spot methods of covering their tracks, such as minor misspellings or URLs connected to other regions. If you receive such an email, make sure to verify that it's actually from Nintendo before proceeding.</p>

			<p>During a special livestream that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just aired</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment announced the final release date for its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak. The cooperative first-person shooter game for up to three players will be launched for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on June 17, priced at $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it will also be available on day one via Microsoft's PC Game Pass/Game Pass Ultimate and Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers in a bid to maximize the player base from the get-go.</p>
<p>Remedy is also releasing a Deluxe Edition, priced at&nbsp;$49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99. This edition includes exclusive cosmetic items and voice packs that allow players to customize their audiovisual identity.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li>Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li>Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li>Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items, including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners of the base game can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition at any time for $10.00 / €10.00 / £7.00.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak Developer Update April 2025" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During today's live stream, Remedy also briefed fans on the post-launch support. Two new Jobs (missions) will be released later in 2025, while even more updates will be made available throughout 2026. As the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, all post-launch content will be free, and monetization will be limited to cosmetic-only items.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is powered by Remedy's proprietary Northlight engine, previously seen in Control and Alan Wake 2. However, being a multiplayer game first and foremost, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken care to optimize it</a> to be more accessible to a wider range of PC configurations. Even so, high-end features like path tracing (already implemented in Alan Wake 2) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be supported on PC.</p>

<p>Remedy revealed the news in a livestream this evening, although due to the time altering world event known as embargoed press releases, I'm writing this before the stream goes live on Remedy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/RemedyGames">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/remedygames">Twitch</a> channels. Thus, I can only guess what the reveal looked like for the new job, Hot Fix. 'Jobs' are what they're calling the repeatable missions you'll play through in the titular Federal Bureau Of Control, one of gaming's finest mind-melting bureaucratic horror institutions. A Housing Benefit Form Desk Of Leaves, if you will.</p>
<p>Firebreak is Remedy's first foray into the Getting That Potentially Infinite Bag world of live service, which, inevitably, means cosmetics. There are two types, the first being 'Requisitions' ("weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more") that'll be sold for an in-game currency you'll earn by playing. No timers or rotating stores for these, either. The second, 'Classified requisitions' ("armor sets, custom voice packs, sprays, and weapon skins"), will cost you. "The items are purely cosmetic, have no gameplay impact, and will remain available permanently," Remedy say. This all sounds like it'll be funding post-launch support, with new jobs planned as early as this year.</p>
<p>Edwin had a chat with Remedy about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">approach to live service recently</a>, in which they basically say that their 'We did not make Firebreak just to get that potentially infinite bag' t-shirts are raising a lot of questions already answered by the shirts. Personally, I'm torn between being reflexively iffy about this stuff on principle while also believing Remedy deserve a fat payday, every day, and rubbing my hands together in glee over what sort of stupidly self-indulgent, brilliant art they can make with the funds. Oh! Oh! I'm coining 'Deep Bloc Galactic'. Because of brutalism, right? Little gift there for you. Nice little Thursday treat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Interestingly, <em>Madden 26</em> is finally leaving behind the aging PS4 and Xbox One. Since 2013, <em>Madden </em>has launched on those consoles every year, but no more. Last year’s <em>Madden 25</em> will be the last EA football game to launch on last-gen machines. Funnily enough, the first <em>Madden </em>to launch on Xbox One and PS4 was also called <em>Madden 25</em>, as the franchise was celebrating its 25 year anniversary. Weird stuff! </p><p>It’s a year of change for <em>Madden</em>, because not only is it skipping consoles it has released on for over a decade, but EA is bringing the football series back to Nintendo platforms.<em> Madden 26 </em>is set to launch on Switch 2 in August alongside the other versions of the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. This is the first time a <em>Madden </em>game has appeared on a Nintendo platform since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012's<em> Madden NFL 13</em>. That game launched on Wii and Wii U</a></span>. </p><p>Weirdly, only <em>Madden</em> is making the leap to Switch 2<em>. EA College Football 26</em> will not be available on Nintendo’s new console. Last year,<em> EA College Football 25 </em>became one of the best selling games in the United States after fans waited a decade to play another EA Sports college football game. (The last one was released in 2013.) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118"><em>EA College Football 25 </em>already skipped PS4 and Xbox One last year</a></span>, so its not surprising they are skipping it again this year. </p><p><em> Madden NFL 26</em> launches for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14.<em> College Football 26 </em>launches on July 10. You can pay EA a ransom fee to play three days early via the $100 <em>Madden NFL 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.” On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, a $150 “MVP Bundle” is also available, and it comes with <em>College Football 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right from the start of the game, there are zero restrictions on where you can go, who you can meet, and what you can do. You can choose to follow the main story quest, which requires you to hand over the amulet the emperor entrusted to you before he died, or completely ignore the story and explore the new world before you.</p><p>If you're a veteran of Oblivion, then you likely have a solid idea of the best places to go first. However, if you're hopping into the game for the first time with the remaster, you might need some guidance. After all, the map is huge and offers some free fast travel destinations thousands of meters away right from the get-go.</p><p>So, what should you do first in Oblivion Remastered?

Along the Black Road, you'll be able to discover a plethora of different locations, such as caves to explore, small towns to see, and quests to start. The Black Road starts with a town called Weye, which is where you can begin the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-complete-go-fish-in-oblivion-remastered/2900-6500/" data-ref-id="2900-6500">Go Fish side quest</a> in Oblivion Remastered that rewards you with a particularly useful ring.</p><p>If you continue on the Black Road, you'll eventually run into Weynon Priory, which is where the first main story quest tells you to go. Here, you can speak to Jauffre and learn about why the emperor gave you the amulet in the first place.</p><p>However, you don't have to stop in Weynon Priory if you don't want to. Instead, you can head right past it and make your way into the city of Chorrol. This city is home to a number of interesting characters and several engaging side quests. It's also where you can join both the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Fighters_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Fighters Guild</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Mages_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Mages Guild</a>.</p><p>Unlike in Skyrim, there's not much of an initiation process to join either guild, so you can enter both of them in the northern part of Chorrol and join straight away. This allows you to accept new quests, meet new characters, and receive some new weapons, spells, and gear. Chorrol isn't the sole city where you can join these guilds, but it's one of the best places to start.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482156"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the Fighters Guild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482156-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-22.26.37.38.png"></figure><p>The Black Road culminates with a location called Battlehorn Castle. Battlehorn Castle is nothing particularly special from the outside, but when you approach it, there will be a small war going on in front of its gates. If you manage to defeat all of the enemies trying to break down the gate, you'll actually receive the deed to Battlehorn Castle. This entitles you to full ownership of the castle and everything that it holds.</p><p>At the very least, Battlehorn Castle offers you free access to a blacksmith to repair your gear, a plethora of beds to sleep in so you can level up, and the possibility to design your own castle. You can talk to a merchant in Imperial City to buy blueprints for various upgrades around the castle to truly make it yours.</p><h2 id="Head_inside_the_North_Sewers">Head inside the North Sewers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482159" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482159"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the North Sewers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482159-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.24-13.56.00.26.png"></figure><p>Just because you emerged from the sewers doesn't mean you can't head right back inside them. From the main sewer entrance in Oblivion Remastered, you can travel west to enter the North Exit of the sewers. Along the way, you might also find a Nirnroot Plant by the nearby lake, which triggers the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/seeking-your-roots-quest-guide-fo-oblivion-remastered/2900-6497/" data-ref-id="2900-6497">Seeking Your Roots quest</a>.</p><p>If you try to enter the North Sewers, you'll need to pick a Hard lock, which can certainly take a few attempts. Once you're inside, make your way through the tight corridors and caverns until you reach a ladder that allows you to head up to "The Main Ingredient" basement. You'll need to pick this lock as well as a lock that allows you to head into The Main Ingredient shop itself from the basement.</p><p>After getting through, though, you can speak to the proprietor of the shop, who's name is Oegir Goerick, and start the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/unfriendly-competition-quest-guide-for-oblivion-remastered/2900-6493/" data-ref-id="2900-6493">Unfriendly Competition quest</a>. This quest is quite the tangled web, but it winds up with you securing two of the best early-game melee weapons in Oblivion Remastered. You also receive some other gear as well as a general understanding of how the Imperial City is laid out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482160"></a><figcaption>Speaking with Oegir Goerick</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482160-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.31.45.42.png"></figure><p>Emerging from the North Sewers allows you an easy way to get inside the heart of the Imperial City and start to explore it a little more. From there, you can go any way you please, explore the city until your heart is content, and head back down to the sewers and start from the way you came.</p><p>One of the best ways to spend your time in the Imperial City is to speak with NPCs and ask them about "Rumors." This lets you know of some major side quests and who to speak to next.</p><h2 id="Join_one_or_all_of_the_Guilds">Join one or all of the Guilds</h2><p>We've already talked about the Fighters and Mages Guilds in Oblivion Remastered, but those aren't the only two guilds you can join in Cyrodiil. You can also join the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Thieves_Guild" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Thieves Guild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/#Dark_Brotherhood" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Dark Brotherhood</a>, both of which require you to perform a specific action instead of visiting a location.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482178"></a><figcaption>Teekeeus is the head of the Chorrol Mages Guild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482178-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-23.28.10.60.png"></figure><p>For the Thieves Guild, you can either commit a crime and choose the option to go to jail, become friends with a beggar by giving them coin and asking about the guild, or find the guild on your own through The Grey Fox. Regardless of how you do it, the Thieves Guild offers some great quests and rewards in Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>You could also join the Dark Brotherhood, which is only doable after you murder an innocent person and then go to sleep in a bed. During your rest, an NPC named Lucien Lachance will approach you about joining.</p><p>In addition to all of the guilds in Oblivion Remastered, you can also join the Imperial Arena. This location is found within Imperial City and by speaking with Owyn, you can take part in Arena battles as a participant. The Arena allows you to fight enemies and soar through different ranks as you keep winning, which earns you new rewards in the process.</p><h2 id="Go_east_towards_Vilverin">Go east towards Vilverin</h2><p>The final direction we'll offer is to go east from the sewer entrance. Directly across the lake, you'll find an Aeylid Ruin by the name of Vilverin. If you travel inside Vilverin, you'll be able to loot a slew of interesting items. One of the more notable pieces of loot are Welkynd Stones, which allow you to instantly regain magicka points. They're also used as a conduit for shock spells, which come in handy if you join the Mages Guild in Chorrol.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482179"></a><figcaption>The location of Vilverin </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4482179-theelderscrollsivoblivionremasteredscreenshot2025.04.23-18.36.29.36.png"></figure><p>Also inside Vilverin you'll find a number of chests with plenty of gold, some bandits to kill and loot, and a number of different areas to explore. After you're done with the Aeylid Ruin, you can exit and keep heading east along the Blue Road towards the city of Cheydinhal. There are branches of the Mages and Fighters Guild here as well and plenty of other quests to embark on.</p><p>You could also head slightly north from Vilverin and take the Silver Road to the city of Bruma. While Bruma isn't too exciting, it's certainly not a bad city to visit and explore either.</p>

This one's a biggie, too: it's called Celestial Guardians, and it's themed around Pokemon Sun and Moon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians officially releases on April 30, and is a bigger expansion than the last couple, with two different types of booster packs themed around legendaries Solgaleo and Lunala. It primarily features Alolan Pokemon, including the three starters Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio, as well as regional variants such as Alolan Raichu and Marowak. And of course, it comes with new trainer cards, themed around popular characters from the Alola region, and new ways to display your collection such as a new binder cover and display board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the set also appears to include what looks like two versions of the starter trio, a daytime and a nighttime version, each with different stats and abilities. It's unclear how prevalent this split is going to be throughout the set, but it could make for some interesting decks if there are multiple paths to getting the same cards out on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon TCG Pocket Celestial Guardians Expansion First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians is the sixth expansion so far and the third major one, following major expansions Genetic Apex and Space-Time Smackdown and smaller expansions Mythical Island, Triumphant Light, and the most recent, Shining Revelry. At the time this piece was written, none of these expansions have been retired yet, but it's perhaps only a matter of time before we say goodbye to Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Pokemon TCG Pocket has kept up the pace with roughly one new expansion per month, alongside regular in-game solo and competitive events. Alongside collecting and battling, TCG Pocket also implemented trading earlier this year, but the feature was widely panned due to its high cost barrier and lack of useful trading feature, forcing the developer to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually">confirm changes were on the way</a>... months down the road.

                <p>I'll be real: Now that I think about it, the trick I'm about to talk about is <em>incredibly </em>obvious. So I'm begging you, please don't judge me too harshly and appreciate the fact that I am majorly humbling myself by writing about this. And, for those of you who also didn't realize you could do this, rest assured that you are in good-ish company.</p><p>Earlier this year, Fields of Mistria's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fields-of-mistrias-second-major-update-march-2025/2900-6312/" data-ref-id="2900-6312">second major update</a> was released, bringing with it the lava caves biome. And did you know that, unlike me, you don't have to use your watering can and desperately hop around the cave's various rock formations to progress through it? In a post shared on the official Field of Mistria Instagram, the team behind the game revealed that players can use the game's rain spell to instantly solidify every single inch of lava on the floor. That's right. All of it. And although this feat takes a lot of mana if you want to do it on multiple levels, man oh man, it changes things--and saves my poor stamina bar.</p><p>Admittedly, I haven't played nearly as much Fields of Mistria since the game's second update dropped--I blame the absolutely wild number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">phenomenal games that have come out this year</a> for that. For this reason, I think I'm a <em>little</em> more justified in not picking up on this sooner. But as someone who delights in games that force you to think about things in more roundabout way (ie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo/" data-ref-id="5000-582009">Paranormasight</a>, etc.), I am kicking myself for not considering that I could use the rain spell down in the mines.</p><p>While this is probably the biggest "oh god, you can do that" to come from Mistria's Instagram page, I also highly recommend checking out all the other tips, too. For example, did you know that if you feed a mimic items, it will spit out valuable resources and simply disappear? I've also noticed quite a few folks who have struggled a bit with the slimes that shoot rocks at you down there. The trick to besting them? Swing your sword at the right time and send those rocks hurling right back at 'em; just two good shots should do it.</p><p>While NPC Studios remains hard at work on the already fantastic farming simulator, we at GameSpot are continuing to chug away on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/guides/">Field of Mistria guides</a>.
