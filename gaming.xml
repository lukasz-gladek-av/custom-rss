		<p>Firewalk’s PlayStation exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> has been revealed, with a slick animated cinematic trailer paired with a gameplay reveal for the 5v5 first person shooter. A pre-launch beta will be held in July with a full launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> on 23rd August 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Reveal Cinematic Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBnStS9d2xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Concord will drop you into the shoes of the crew of the North Star, taking on high-stakes jobs that will see you facing off against other Free Gunner crews. With class-based characters each with contrasting abilities and gear, there will be a lot of you wondering how this is different from Overwatch. Well, some gear and gadgets will have effects that persist beyond rounds, so traps, lane-blockers, shield barriers and more can shape an entire match between teams.</p>

<p>Each week will open with a new cinematic vignette that will feed into the character building and overarching universe that Firewalk is creating, aiming to go beyond the character building of other examples of the genre.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how all of this comes together when we get a first look in July.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every PlayStation State of Play SGF 2024 Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-playstation-state-of-play-sgf-2024-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-playstation-state-of-play-sgf-2024-announcement.885606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-playstation-state-of-play-sgf-2024-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today the PlayStation State of Play is launching giving us 30+ minutes of news and previews of games coming to the Sony PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR 2. While it was only announced yesterday there's already plenty of buzz around the 14 PS5 and PSVR2 titles that will be releasing in the future.</p>

<p>The internet has already started acting up making predictions about what we might see of familiar faces like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation">Atreus</a>, Aloy, and Astrobot. Whether we'll get to see <em>Silent Hill 2</em> here, or have to wait another hour until the <a href="https://twitter.com/SilentHill/status/1795228495024734344"><em>Silent Hill</em> Transmission</a>. We of course wouldn't be ready for an SGF presentation if people weren't also wondering what if this is the time for <em>Bloodborne </em>or <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>to make an appearance. Putting aside all rumors though we're here to cover the events of the show itself.</p>



<h3>Concord - Firewalk</h3>

<p>Kicking off the presentation Asad Qizilbash invited Firewalk to talk about their upcoming title Concord. Before seeing gameplay a trailer was shown detailing some of the characters players would meet. The trailer, set in Crater City, shows a crew of misfits in a diner. Enjoying food, discussing plans, and checking out the jugebok.</p>

<p>Getting interrupted a brawl starts as hot sauce is thrown into the air and shot at. Some abilities we see from characters including the ability to jump high, create diamond skin, and throw exploding fire pellets. The large robot companion uses a vacuum weapon to draw a key item towards him before the structure they're on falls to pieces sending them falling from the sky.</p>

<p>The trailer definitely gave the feels of the modern <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>as each maintains a laid back composure when in a high-stakes scenario.</p>

<p>Developers behind the game spoke briefly after the trailer about what it's like to be part of this ships crew and the different missions you'll go on across planets. As a 'freegunner' you'll be taking on other teams in direct combat.</p>

<p>Gameplay was shown of Vale, the sniper seen in the trailer with jumping abilities.&nbsp;Lennox is a more traditional shooter/gunslinger character. Haymar uses fire in her various attacks including a crossbow. Star Child is a larger tank character who can harden their skin as well as dealing out heavy hits. 1-OFF is the large robot member. His vacuum weapon can pull or push as well as placing various environmental features like fan pads.</p>

<p>A beta will be available in July for PlayStation 5 and PC with a launch on August 23rd, 2024.</p>



<h3>God of War Ragnarok PC Port - Sony Santa Monica</h3>

<p>The PC port of God of War Ragnarok was the second announcement at the State of Play.</p>

<p>PC features will include unlocked framerates, NVIDIA and AMD enhancements, Super Ultrawide Support, and the Valhalla DLC.</p>

<p>The PC port will release on September 19th, 2024</p>



<h3>Dynasty Warriors Origins - Omega Force</h3>

<p>A Dynasty Warriors trailer showed off grand combat with a variety of major characters from the much loved franchise battling it out across plains as well as in&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming 2025 to PlayStation 5</p>



<h3>Infinity Nikki</h3>

<p>The next trailer showed off a mysterious girl in a new world setting out as a stylist. In this game, you make your way through a variety of platforming adventures as the female human character or her cat companion.</p>

<p>Gameplay showed off frequent fashion changes to fit the aesthetic of the world as well as a photo mode capturing many of the gorgeous moments. This comes across as a AAA cosycore title for a genre that has been gaining immense popularity.</p>

<p>A test will occur in Q3 2024 for the PlayStation</p>



<h3>Ballad of Antara - Infold</h3>

<p>The next trailer from Tipsworks is a stark change of pace as we're invited into a grim fantasy world. Filled with large foreboding castles, cursed fields, and high fantasy enemies gameplay shows off characters with a variety of weapons taking on different foes.</p>

<p>The gameplay gives vibes of soulslike but we'll have to wait a bit longer for the game to come out in 2025.</p>



<h3>Skydance's Behemoth - Skydance</h3>

<p>For the PSVR2 Skydance games shows off a fantasy game where players pick up arms (and a grappling hook) to investigate a castle blanketed by snow. Combat shows the players fighting in melee combat against human foes while also avoiding different giants.</p>



<h3>Alien: Rogue Incustion - Survios</h3>

<p>Continuing with the theme of PSVR2 a trailer for the Alien VR title is shown off. The trailer, while brief, shows off a tense and dark ship environment before the cut to logo.</p>

<p>This game will release in Holiday 2024</p>



<h3>Marvel Rivals</h3>

<p>A new trailer for the upcoming Marvel heroshooter, Marvel Rivals, was shown next. Gameplay for Venom, Adam Warlock, and Hel gave a chance to see each of their special abilities and fighting styles.</p>

<p>Combo moves between related characters, either by blood or by team, showed off how a lot of work has been put into making the game as faithful to the story as possible.</p>

<p>The trailer ended with a lingering shot of Black Panthers feet, and the announcement that the Scarlet Spider costume would be a PlayStation Exclusive.</p>



<h3>Where Winds Meet - Everstone Studios</h3>

<p>Back to soulslike gameplay a fantasy edo-era game from Everstone Studios showed a quick montage of gameplay with a samurai fighting a frozen zombie, umbrella wielding warriors, and a giant fish. While there was a lot to show the trailer ended with the message that this game is currently in development for PlayStation 5</p>



<h3>Until Dawn Remaster - Ballistic Moon</h3>

<p>A trailer for the Until Dawn remaster, set to the strangest cover of 'Save Tonight', played showing off key moments between characters as the horror adventure kicks off.</p>

<p>Until Dawn will come Fall 2024 to PS5 and PC</p>



<h3>Path of Exiles 2 - Grinding Gear Games</h3>

            <p>
Boy! You read that right - God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC. 
</p>
<p>

The news came as part of this evening's State of Play, with Sony adding it will come with its Valhalla DLC included.
</p>
<p>

The upcoming PC port - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-the-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc-leaker-suggests">rumoured to be in the pipeline</a> prior to this evening's announcement - will join other former PlayStation console exclusives such as Days Gone, Horizon Forbidden West and Marvel's Spider-Man, which have all made the transition to an additional platform over recent years. </p>
<p>You can check out God of War Ragnarök's PC trailer below. </p>

<p>

Our Chris Tapsell called God of War Ragnarök "gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd" on its initial release in 2022.
</p>
<p>
"Ragnarök's dramatic might comes from its unique access to a sense of scale, a sense that was so sorely missed in the previous game and remedied with conviction here at last," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return">Eurogamer's God of War Ragnarök review</a>.
</p>
<p>
"You will fight some big, ugly monsters in God of War Ragnarök, you will climb on their backs, lash at them with your blades, bellow defiance up to them from below. You'll stand silhouetted, jagged, cartoonishly angular in front of them. Finally, deep into this game, you will get a bit of the old Kratos back, a bit of PS2 excess will break free of its self-conscious cage."
</p>
<p>
God of War Ragnarök is set to make its PC debut on 19th September.

Earlier today, soon-to-be PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst shared some insight into the company's strategy for bringing its games to PC. The exec said live-service games will be released day and date on PC, however <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-explains-why-its-not-bringing-tentpole-games-to-pc-at-same-time-as-ps5">the team is remaining more "strategic"</a> with when it brings its single player and narrative driven titles to an additional platform.

During its summer State of Play event, Sony announced that <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> is coming to PC Setptember  19th. The news was accompanied by <a href="https://youtu.be/4mVaKztSoJM?si=m3HIsVYk5wFHJzwY">a brand-new trailer</a> including the info that the game is now available for pre-order.</p><p>It’s been just over a year since <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> released, adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5">another emotional beat to the story of Kratos, the god of war, and his son, Atreus</a>. When we last left the pair in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4">2018’s <em>God of War</em></a>, the two had just returned from an epic journey to disperse Atreus’ mother’s ashes from the highest peak in the nine realms. In <em>Ragnarök,</em> Kratos and Atreus’ lives have been upended by the omens heralding the destruction of the realms, an event that is connected to Atreus’ destiny. The two go on a journey — sometimes separate, sometimes together — to figure out that destiny and to put a stop to the god Odin’s evil plans. </p><div><p><em>Ragnarök</em> is coming to PC at a time when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155604/square-enix-multiplatform-games-xbox-pc">gaming publishers are considering branching out</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">beyond the walled gardens of console exclusivity</a> to reach new players. This is one of the fastest PC ports for a first-party single-player Sony game, releasing a little more than an year after its console launch. Other Sony exclusives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/13/23792964/the-last-of-us-steam-deck-port-performance-review"><em>The Last Of Us</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173240/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-sony-playstation-ps4-exclusive-game-release"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092291/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-release-date-steam"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> remained on console for several years before seeing their own PC ports. The timing of this announcement is also somewhat ironic, however, as earlier this week, PlayStation’s new CEO, Hermen Hulst, commented that while multiplayer games will see day and date releases on PC, the strategy for single-player games is to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">entice players to experience them on the PlayStation console</a>.  </p></div><p>And there’s an interesting if unfortunate merit to that strategy, as Sony’s single-player PC ports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363127/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-port-review-performance">have a reputation</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23661352/last-of-us-part-i-pc-launch-bugs-issues">of being quite poor</a> at launch. Hopefully, though, with the full might of Ragnarök behind him, the God of War will avoid such issues.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167407/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-confirmation"><h2>Google confirms the leaked Search documents are real</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24167745/microsoft-macbook-air-benchmarks-surface-laptop-copilot-plus-pc"><h2>All of Microsoft’s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo"><h2>Google won’t comment on a potentially massive leak of its search algorithm documentation</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166934/ebike-battery-china-tariff-price-increase-biden-climate"><h2>Electric bikes are about to get more expensive, and the timing couldn’t be worse</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167147/discord-gaming-focus-redesign"><h2>Discord’s turning the focus back to games with a new redesign</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div><div><h2>More from this stream<!-- --> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill">All the news from PlayStation’s summer State of Play</a></h2><ul><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168271/look-i-have-no-idea-whats-going-on-in-this-game">Look, I have no idea what’s going on in this game.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-05-30T22:20:32.574Z"> <!-- -->May 30, 2024, 10:20 PM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168268/new-dynasty-warriors-coming-next-year">New Dynasty Warriors coming next year.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-05-30T22:18:35.320Z"> <!-- -->May 30, 2024, 10:18 PM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168264/oh-and-heres-some-gameplay">Oh, and here’s some gameplay.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-05-30T22:15:36.201Z"> <!-- -->May 30, 2024, 10:15 PM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168249/an-intro-to-sonys-next-multiplayer-shooter">An intro to Sony’s next multiplayer shooter.</a></h3><p><time datetime="2024-05-30T22:09:58.977Z"> <!-- -->May 30, 2024, 10:09 PM UTC</time></p></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill">See all <!-- -->6<!-- --> stories</a> </div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about God of War Ragnarok’s upcoming PC release will be added soon.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation titles eventually coming to PC has become a more-or-less standard thing, but Sony has remained relatively quiet about when one of their biggest PS5 exclusives, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a>, would be making the jump. Of course, rumors have been flying for the last couple of months, but there’s been no official confirmation from Sony.</p>
<p>Well, today during Sony’s latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a>, they finally let the cat out of the bag, revealing a September PC release date for God of War Ragnarok along with an impressive new trailer. Of course, the game will come with a variety of PC-exclusive features, including ultrawide resolutions, and support of DLSS 3.7, FSR 3.1, and XeSS 1.3. The Valhalla DLC will also be packed with the game.&nbsp;You can check out the trailer for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarök PC - Announce Trailer | PC Games (Audio Description Available)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mVaKztSoJM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looks like another solid PC port from the (mostly) reliable folks at Team Blue. Haven’t been keeping up God of War Ragnarok? Wccftech’s Agnese Carluccio awarded it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare 10 out of 10 in her full review</a>…</p>
<p><em>“God of War Ragnarok is exactly what we hoped for, and even more. It offers a masterfully told story using a more mature approach, seasoned with a unique setting, a rich characterization of the characters, and challenges that can keep even hardcore gamers busy at the highest difficulties. In other words, it is a title that is simply just too good to be missed.”</em></p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is available now on PS5 and launches on PC on September 13 of this year. What do you think PC partisans? Eager to get your hands on Kratos’ latest?</p>

<p>For many PC players, the idea of buying a console, especially one as expensive as a PlayStation 5, feels unlikely. There are no console-exclusive games that prove enticing enough, especially when most wind up coming to PC. Now, here comes God of War Ragnarok. Here is what you should know about the God of War Ragnarok PC release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-god-of-war-ragnarok-release-date-on-pc">What is the God of War Ragnarok Release Date on PC?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the PlayStation State of Play, we now know that God of War Ragnarok will be released on <strong>PC on September 19</strong>. Following the live showcase from Sony and PlayStation, it’ll be available for pre-order on Steam.</p>



<p>It took many years for Sony to realize just how popular and welcoming the PC gaming community is to their previously console-exclusive titles. God of War didn’t launch until 2022, but it received countless sales and acclaim on Steam. Now, it’s time for God of War Ragnarok to receive the same treatment!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-god-of-war-ragnarok-worth-playing-on-pc-in-2024">Is God of War Ragnarok Worth Playing on PC in 2024?</h2>



<p>If you love story-driven action-adventure games, too few titles these days deliver on atmosphere and aesthetics like God of War. Plus, it provides plenty of value for your money. You can beat the main story in approximately 27 hours, or 54 if you want to complete all of the side content, and then there’s the fantastic roguelike game mode.</p>



<p>Overall, God of War Ragnarok on PC will likely become a fan favorite, as the last entry in the series did, too.</p>

<p>During the PlayStation State of Play showcase, the team at Firewalk Studios revealed a new trailer for Concord, a developing multiplayer-based first-person shooter that will be released on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23rd, 2024.</p>



<p>Last year, Firewalk Studios announced Concord after joining the PlayStation Studios community. This announcement was made in the form of a 50-second teaser trailer that gave nothing away – but the latest trailer showcased at the State of Play event tells us all we need to know about the game. It smacks of Guardians of the Galaxy – make of that what you will.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-game-not-the-plane">The Game, Not The Plane</h2>



<p>Firewalk Studios was assembled in 2018 by former Bungie and Activision employees, and in 2023, the squad fell in under the PlayStation Studios banner. It’s assumed that Concord has been Firewalk’s sole project since the inception of the company, which means it could have been in development for more than five years. </p>



<p>Concord is being developed in collaboration with Bungie and Haven Studios. Last year, Firewalk Studios promised that the game would be revealed in full before being released <strong>this year</strong>, and now that the latest State of Play event has arrived, they’ve stayed true to that promise.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Concord - Reveal Cinematic Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBnStS9d2xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s quite a bizarre showing, with this sci-fi-themed trailer revealing a range of alien characters that have serious Guardians of the Galaxy vibes. In a follow-up segment that showed gameplay, we got a look at the core mechanics of Concord. As Firewalk expanded on the game, it was revealed that it’ll be a five-vs-five multiplayer game that’s deeply dynamic, with every match being unique. As the game’s lifecycle expands, so too will the story behind the ‘Concord galaxy’.</p>



<p>It looks like a mix between Overwatch and VALORANT on the surface, with a dynamic that expands over time, keeping players interested.</p>

However, that's changing in a new update that brings a battle pass-style feature to the game's main menu, and fans aren't happy.</p><p>Today, EA revealed its plan for Events in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-events?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-login-events-info-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=80388&amp;ts=1717099135660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a>, describing each event as a "limited time experience, centered around a fun theme, with free rewards or gameplay that adds new opportunities to your game."</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Come for the vending machine, leave with a brand-new trait! 🤩</p><p>Events are here in The Sims 4 as limited time experiences with free rewards that adds new opportunities to your game. ✨</p><p>Discover more: <a href="https://t.co/RepxRYq9xn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/RepxRYq9xn</a> <a href="https://t.co/fZZqynBeIm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/fZZqynBeIm</a></p></div>— The Sims (@TheSims) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1796197896259268788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Each Event is free and offers 8 rewards over the course of 4 weeks, with new rewards being made available each week.

Still, claiming each reward requires extra commitment, and fans haven't been happy about it, with many taking to Twitter/X to share their disappointment. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>TIMED EVENTS IN THE SIMS 4???</p><p>fuck off. no. ur turning this game into a mobile game, this is NOT what we wanted. listen, i hate when people say this, but WHO TF ASKED FOR THIS??? fuck all the way off with this bullshit.</p><p>(pics from simscommunity) <a href="https://t.co/rnY9c3pqLu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rnY9c3pqLu</a></p></div>— OakieDokie (@OakSimStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/OakSimStudios/status/1795517672421232645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This isn’t it.

                <p>The<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"> Fortnite</a> community has had mixed reactions since the start of Season 3, with a major complaint being that the vehicles are too strong. But thanks to the game's latest patch, vehicles will no longer be as strong as they were at the start of the season.</p><p>In a tweet posted on the official Fortnite X/Twitter account, it was announced that boss cars will no longer automatically regain health like they used to, and vehicles will now have less health than usual when playing Solos. In addition, the accuracy of machine guns will be reduced, and the grenade launcher will do less damage to structures.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/fortnitegame/status/1796238498711679236?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Talk about a high octane season launch 🔥 <br>We’ve unvaulted Boogie Bombs 🚗 💃🕺 as well as made some balance adjustments to some features, like:<br>🛠Reduced Machine Gun Turrets accuracy and Grenade Launcher Turrets damage to structures.<br>🛠Reduced vehicle health in Solos.<br>🛠Boss…</p>  — Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1796238498711679236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">On top of that, vehicles will receive more damage whenever they're shot from Boom Bolts. The Nitro Gauntlets will now have a longer recharge time, and players will take less damage whenever they take damage from a Nitro shoulder bash.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though the latest patch brings many balance adjustments, it also unvaulted the Boogie Bomb, a fan-favorite weapon, though they're not long for this world. Epic teased that it would be bringing back a "widely-requested electric throwable to replace Boogie Bombs sooooon."</p><p>Not everyone has been frustrated with this season's focus on car combat.

                <p dir="ltr">Sony has officially unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a>, its latest live-service game from developer Firewalk Studios. The game was given its first reveal at the latest PlayStation State of Play celebration, showing off the 5v5 shooter. Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23, with a pre-launch beta running in July.</p><p dir="ltr">Concord was revealed with a story trailer showing off some of the characters and the world of the multiplayer shooter. The game has a sci-fi setting, with a variety of different aliens. Characters are shown to have different abilities, like robot legs to jump high and diamond skin to absorb extra damage. The different groups are Free Gunners, which basically mercenaries, complete with Guardians of the Galaxy-inspired banter and jokes.</p><p dir="ltr">The team shooter is 5v5, featuring unique named heroes with their own weapons and special abilities. The game looks heavily inspired by other hero shooters, like Overwatch 2, with teams battling out in different objective-based modes. Some unique mechanics include special equipment, like healing pads and trip mines, that carry over not just between deaths, but even across rounds. There will be over a dozen characters at launch, with new story content added to the game regularly.</p><p>Concord is Firewalk Studios' first game. Unlike most of Sony's first-party projects, it was previously announced to be coming to PC alongside the PS5 version. A teaser trailer previously showed space travel, and Firewalk says that each multiplayer match is a "<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-concord-a-new-pvp-multiplayer-fps-from-firewalk-studios-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/" rel="nofollow ">new story</a>."</p>

Around back are two customizable rear paddles amidst the controller’s contoured and rubberized grips. If you squint, it looks a bit like a thick-boy version of the Backbone One, though the Nomad is compatible with more phone cases since it relies on Bluetooth for connectivity instead of a protruding USB-C or Lightning plug.</p><p>Scuf’s first foray into the world of phone controllers is compatible with competitive mobile games like <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>, <em>Warzone Mobile</em>, and cloud / remote play streaming services like the PlayStation Remote Play app. The accompanying Scuf app for launching games, capturing and sharing gameplay recordings, and tweaking controls does not require paid subscriptions.</p><p>To me, as an original Backbone One owner, the Nomad and its larger Hall effect sticks, contoured grips, and Xbox-like D-pad seem intriguing,<strong> </strong>though Bluetooth has higher latency than the Backbone’s direct connection. And it’s yet another device to keep charged, albeit one with a claimed 16 hours of battery life.</p><p>The Nomad is <a href="https://scufgaming.com/mobile-controllers/scuf-nomad-black">available to preorder</a> now in black or white and estimated to arrive July 8th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162575/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa-souvenir-prop-prosthetic-arm-chris-hemsworth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="FTZAQw">Given that practically any item from a movie set can be <a href="https://propstore.com/props/">sold as memorabilia</a> these days — I once worked with a writer who bought some of the gritty, gravel-covered rubber frogs from the rain-of-frogs scene in Paul Thomas Anderson’s <em>Magnolia</em>, on a whim — it’s no wonder that film fans tend to have a small, enduring fascination with the items that movie stars sneak off movie sets. It can seem endearingly human for a celebrity to want a souvenir of a production — or just <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2872405/Mark-Wahlberg-reveals-intimate-souvenir-took-played-porn-star-Boogie-Nights.html">tellingly hilarious</a> about what a given star values and finds cool.</p>
<p id="OawV0a">Polygon recently got a chance to sit down with Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth to ask, among other things, whether they wanted to keep anything from the set of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, George Miller’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a> prequel. Hemsworth says he wishes he could have kept the teddy bear his character, Dementus, keeps chained to his body throughout the movie — a small leftover detail from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">anime series Miller was planning to make about Furiosa</a>. “I didn’t. I should’ve,” he says. “The detail was pretty incredible for the art department and from George. I’m going to track that bear down. We need it to come home.”</p>
<p id="Nyksff">Taylor-Joy, on the other hand, says she kept the prosthetic arm she wears in the latter half of the movie, after a particularly destructive encounter with Dementus. She adds that there were multiple versions of the prosthetic, depending on the needs of specific shots: “a soft one for certain kinds of stunts, and then you need a hard one for when you’re really looking heavy metal.” (She did not, however, say which one she wound up taking home.)</p>

<p id="2hMOo4">Polygon also asked what Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth would bring along if they had to visit the Wasteland — the post-apocalyptic Australian setting of the Mad Max movies. Taylor-Joy says she would bring the cat she now owns after adopting in Australia, “a Wasteland kitty” who she says is “well-trained” so he could be on set during the shoot.</p>
<p id="0fp0qL">Hemsworth, on the other hand, suggests he would just bring as many solar panels as possible, to get around the Mad Max series’ obsession with and wars over fuel (“guzzolene” in the series’ mythos). “I’d just be like, <em>No need for the war!</em>” he says. “I think <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162501/furiosa-mad-max-sequel-wasteland-release-date-cast">the next film</a> will be full of solar power.”</p>

<p id="aqB5EJ">In a more serious vein, Hemsworth and Taylor-Joy addressed the action sequences they found most memorable to shoot. Hemsworth says he never really got to be central to the kinds of stunts Taylor-Joy was involved with.</p>
<p id="FuBifs">“My character was sort of Emperor-esque, sort of at the back, pointing his finger and forcing everyone else to charge into the fray,” he says. “I had a few driving scenes, which were a hell of a lot of fun.”</p>
<p id="u77MIT">Taylor-Joy, on the other hand, calls back to the lengthy sequence where Furiosa stows away on the undercarriage of the giant battle vehicle, the War Rig, and ends up in the middle of a massive chase and fight sequence. “That whole sequence — we shot that for 78 days,” she says. “It was the first thing that I shot. It was the last thing that I shot. The crew of people that made that possible — there was definitely a moment, like maybe day 50, where you’re just like, <em>How am I still on this rig?</em> But it was so cool seeing it come together. And the fact that it has such an important storyline — you get to see her kind of in her new form, how quickly she acquires skills. That was very satisfying.”</p>

You can easily spot them as tall poles with runes etched onto the front. Activating a Lorestangir causes a rune to glow red, showing you the progress you’ve made so far. Some can be missed in the game, so be sure to follow the list below closely.</p>

Before you reach the town, look for the Lorestangir just past a couple of huts to your right.</p> <figure data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="11" data-current-count="11" data-injectable="false"><strong>Freyslaug 2</strong></p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">After you acquire the mirror and return to the real world, cross the bridge to the ruined village beyond.

Take a left at the wooden trail marker that appears after you reach the bottom of the hill. Hug the left wall and turn right after the ruined house to see the Lorestangir. It’s opposite a hidden face, another collectible in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ava-and-the-half-world-is-a-perspective-switching-roguelite-with-captivating-art/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ava-and-the-half-world-is-a-perspective-switching-roguelite-with-captivating-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I have a soft spot for perspective-switching games, and <em>AVA and the Half-World </em>already looks like one to keep an eye on. While there’s no release date in place, developer Bread Panda revealed the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-difference-between-roguelike-and-roguelite-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roguelite</a> action game for PC in a trailer that shows off its shooting in side- and forward-scrolling flavors.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">The trailer also gives us a peek at the beautiful art that fuels it all, both in its characters and creatures and the colorful world they inhabit. &nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="AVA and the Half-World - Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_tbrvp-QRc?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">In what sounds like a futile affair, AVA’s destiny involves fading away with the rest of the world. With the end all but inevitable, AVA soars through the islands of the Sidereal Riptide, blasting away at enemies, collecting artifacts, and hopefully solving the mysteries that await.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">As the trailer shows, one of the key hooks of that journey is the way AVA can transition from firing away on a 2D plane to blasting forth through visuals akin to classic rail shooters like <em>Space Harrier</em>. From what I can gather, at least, it looks like more of a visual trick that retains the side-scrolling combat on a different plane. However it may work, it’s still a very cool idea that looks great in motion.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bread Panda</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="850" data-injectable="false">Bread Panda took inspiration from roguelites and adventure games, with the former lending itself to repeat expeditions that play out in unique ways. There’s also the mechanic of collecting artifacts and choosing which to keep and which to return to the Riptide, giving you the opportunity to customize AVA’s fighting style with various weapons and relics. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2936830/AVA_and_the_HalfWorld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>AVA and the Half-World</em></a> will eventually be entering an increasingly busy space, but I’m keen on seeing how its key gimmick and idiosyncratic design sense play out in practice.&nbsp;</p>

PlayStation has correctly decided that the best way to ensure its forthcoming lineup of games gets the most attention is to put on a show before everyone else puts on theirs.</p><p>According to the announcement, the presentation will last roughly 30 minutes and feature 14 games for PlayStation consoles and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166879/sony-psvr2-pc-support-adapter-certification-filing">PSVR 2</a>. While PlayStation hasn’t shared the lineup for the event, there are rumors circulating on social media that suggest PC ports for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/22/23516917/god-of-war-ragnarok-ending-analysis"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4"><em>Until Dawn</em></a>, a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro Bot</em></a><em> </em>game, and a new game in the <em>Alien</em> series are on the way.

In <em>Ragnarök,</em> Kratos and Atreus’ lives have been upended by the omens heralding the destruction of the realms, an event that is connected to Atreus’ destiny. The two go on a journey — sometimes separate, sometimes together — to figure out that destiny and to put a stop to the god Odin’s evil plans. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168045/god-of-war-pc-release-date-ps5-state-of-play">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-44804bcd-b2e0-42a3-b60c-cfcfb7a3ea95"><div><p>Look, I have no idea what’s going on in this game.</p><p>But it sure looks cute. <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is described as an “open-world dress-up adventure game” which, well, that definitely is a genre.

Most of them are unlocked by doing the game’s main scenario quests, but some of them are locked behind side quests.</p>
<p id="iruZwX">The ones locked behind side quests still have substantial rewards, as a chunk of them do have “Extreme” versions, where you can earn <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14/22382215/mount-unlock-chocobo-flying-level-requirement">mounts</a> and other special loot upon clearing. Most expansions had an extra trial or two, while adding three fights as part of a lengthier side quest that expands heavily on the lore of characters or areas in the game. In <em>Endwalker</em>, the usual three trials was actually folded into the main scenario quests, so there’s only one optional trial.</p>

<p id="87UPJI">All of these quests require you to at least complete the main scenario quest “The Ultimate Weapon.”</p>
<h3 id="iK7EGN"><strong>Where to unlock ‘A Relic Reborn: The Chimera’ and ‘A Relic Reborn: The Hydra’</strong></h3>

<p id="Vu3J76">This line of side quests unlocks the trials as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="YTkZkB">“The Three Collectors” — “Battle on the Big Bridge” (Gilgamesh)</li>
<li id="8OwDlM">“The Coliseum Conundrum” — “The Dragon’s Neck” (Ultros and Typhon)</li>

Once the divers reach “critical mass,” the planet will implode into a black hole, taking the super-horny Terminids in its wake.

If divers are successful, Meridia will no longer be a playable area. And there will be no take-backsies. </p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">“The destruction of an entire planet is an irreversible action — one that all Super Earth citizens know is a terrible tragedy,” reads the mission brief. “But the tyrannical actions of the Terminids have left us no alternative.”</p>

Termicide, a chemical the finest minds of SE assured was safe, is what caused Meridia to become a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/termicide-just-made-helldivers-2s-terminids-stronger-and-stranger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminid breeding ground</a>. It’s up to Helldivers to fix the problem again, but this time for good. Maybe.</p>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">The operation relies on players to complete a new mission type: ‘Deploy Dark Fluid’.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The PS5 might be trending slightly behind the PS4 in total lifetime sales globally (it’s ahead in the U.S.), but Sony revealed that those who have upgraded are spending a lot. PS5 players have dolled out $731 on average on the new platform, compared to $580 for PS4 players at a similar period in the console cycle. At the halfway point, revenue for the PS5 generation is $106 billion in sales, and $10 billion in operating income (profit), which is roughly the same as what the PS4 achieved in its full seven year life cycle.</p><p>That success is due in part to the ongoing popularity of the older console. Roughly half the player base is still on PS4, though PS5 players play almost twice as many hours in aggregate as their last-gen counter-parts. It makes sense that the most loyal players would be the ones to upgrade, but it has certainly eroded the idea of modern console generations being discrete cycles rather than continuations of platform like on PC and smartphones. </p><h2 id="h2815"><a id=""></a>PC still won’t get big single-player games day-and-date</h2><p>While <em>Helldivers 2 </em>is the best-selling game of the year so far thanks to it coming to PS5 and PC simultaneously, Sony doesn’t have plans to start bringing games like <em>Wolverine</em> day-and-date to Steam. That appears to be reserved for live service games like Firewalk Studios’ <em>Concord</em>, expected later this year, and Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>, slated for release in 2025. </p><p>Hulst said that the company will continue taking a “more strategic” approach with its “tentpole titles” by giving PC players a taste of its console exclusive franchises with ports close to when a sequel is about to come out. “We’re finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing sequels on the PlayStation platform,” he claimed. That’s hard to believe considering Steam diehards are infamous for waiting years to play new blockbusters instead of buying them on rival storefronts like Epic Games.</p><h2 id="h2816"><a id=""></a>Microtransactions are eating into game sales</h2><figure id="" data-id="f79f8a71b4f3c8e60da34608db403979" data-recommend-id="image://f79f8a71b4f3c8e60da34608db403979" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="689" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A presentation slide shows how much PlayStation players spend on different parts of the platform.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Total spending might be up on PS5, but a lot of it is going to the same top 10 live service games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>. Spending on full games has gone down by 12 percent on PS5 compared to PS4, despite the prices going up to $70. Spending on things like DLC, battle passes, and cosmetics, meanwhile, has rocketed up 176 percent this console generation. It’s not hard to see how this translates into a tougher landscape for new games, or why so many publishers are obsessed with making the next <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> or<em> Genshin Impact</em>. First-party Sony games continue to sell well, though: <em>Spider-Man 2</em> has now sold over 11 million copies. <br></p><h2 id="h2817"><a id=""></a>More PS Plus subscribers are upgrading</h2><p>PS Plus is more complicated and expensive than ever, but it seems to be working for Sony thus far. Even if overall subscription numbers haven’t dramatically changed, more regular PS Plus subscribers are upgrading to the Extra and Premium tiers. The Extra tier, which includes the free library of games, grew 16 percent last year, and Premium, which includes access to PlayStation Classics and cloud streaming grew 19 percent. It seems to be in keeping with the theme that if you can’t grow the audience, simply upsell them as much as you can before they burnout. </p><h2 id="h2818"><a id=""></a>PS VR2 who?</h2><figure id="" data-id="198a326cec347b0d9ad519c8951ce6d4" data-recommend-id="image://198a326cec347b0d9ad519c8951ce6d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1343" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A slide whos PS VR in a section of PlayStation accessories.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One thing that doesn’t seem to be growing is the market for Sony’s virtual reality headsets. Nobody asked about PS VR2 in the meeting and it is not called out directly anywhere in the presentation. Instead, the VR headsets are rolled into a general category of “peripherals” alongside headphones and PlayStation Portal handhelds.<br></p><p>While player spending on peripherals has grown 34 percent since the PS4 console generation, it  still makes up the smallest sliver of the total. Sony hasn’t disclosed how many of the headsets its shipped and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-headsets-production-sales-halt-sony-1851344240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-headsets-production-sales-halt-sony-1851344240">has reportedly halted production</a></span> until it can clear out the existing inventory. VR just doesn’t seem to be a meaningful part of Sony’s roadmap at the moment. </p><h2 id="h2819"><a id=""></a>Sony hasn’t given up on mobile</h2><p>Last year, Sony expected half of its releases in 2025 to be on PC and mobile. So far, it hasn’t shipped any new games on smartphones. They’re coming though as part of a strategy to reach new audiences and use that money to subsidize the investment required to grow core franchises on console.  “On mobile we have been hard on at work on establishing a very strong, very seasoned core mobile team,” Hulst said. “We’re taking a more measured approach compared to the more aggressive approach you’ve seen on PC that’s because PC is more adjacent to the core of our development than mobile is.”</p><h2 id="h2820"><a id=""></a>Live service gaming is still the goal</h2><figure id="" data-id="1ea888604dea41fd5aa419a91c51a1e9" data-recommend-id="image://1ea888604dea41fd5aa419a91c51a1e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1263" data-height="707" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A presentation slide shows a list of Sony's studios.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At one point, Hust was asked about the status of Bungie, which laid off 100 people last year amid plunging Destiny 2 numbers. He confirmed that the studio wasn’t expected contribute to Sony’s profit this year, in part due to ongoing investment in <em>Marathon</em>. At the same time, he said “significant progress” had been made with the integration into the rest of PlayStation. That sounds terrifying for longtime Bungie fans, but Hulst said the studio had been invaluable with getting the rest of the company up to speed on developing games as a service. He called these “optimizations” to its production pipelines for these types of games the main goal of the acquisition in the first place.<br></p><p>Will it bear fruit? It seems like only about a half of the dozen or so live service projects originally in development at one time or another are still moving forward. Sci-fi shooter <em>Concord</em> is one of those. <em>Fairgame$</em>, Haven’s stab at multiplayer heist genre, is another. Neon Koi, Sony’s mobile game studio, is also listed under the Live Service Focus” section of its presentation. Guerrilla Games, meanwhile, is under the “Evolving / Multi-Genre” section, and we know it’s working on multiplayer spin-offs of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. </p><p>Interestingly, Bend Studio, which made <em>Days Gone</em>, is in the same category, suggesting its next project might have a multiplayer component as well. Whether any of these live service games can supplant the ones already taking up so much of the oxygen on PlayStation remains to be seen. With microtransaction spending growing the most since the PS4 generation, it’s easy to see why Sony wants to try. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When Helldivers were asked to spread a neurotoxin known as Termicide earlier this year, flying Terminid enemies known as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly">Shriekers</a> began to emerge.

<p dir="ltr">But that's not all. Diablo 4 players will also get to enjoy 25% increased XP gains and 50% more gold thanks to another event, Mother's Blessing, which will last 10 days in total. Blizzard at time of writing had not released an exact start or end date for the Mother Blessing XP and gold buffs. A number of free cosmetic items will be up for grabs too, including weapon appearances and a mount. Players will have until June 20 to claim the free gifts.</p><p dir="ltr">March of the Goblins is coming to Blizzard's mobile game Diablo Immortal too, which is celebrating its two-year anniversary with increased Treasure Goblin appearances and an anniversary event that will see players earning rewards for completing various weekly tasks. One of Diablo 4's world bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-beat-avarice-the-gold-cursed-world-boss/1100-6515200/" data-ref-id="1100-6515200">Avarice the Gold Cursed</a>, will be added to Diablo Immortal for players to challenge, as will a mysterious new Legendary Gem that will be granted to all players for free, but must be claimed by June 20. The game's Trial of the Hordes has been reimagined as the Trial of Plunder, with increased treasure goblin-appearances there as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, a 36-hour Goblin's Plunder buff that will increase rewards by 200% from various activities, will be granted to all Diablo Immortal players. However, players get to choose when to activate the buff, and it will only count down while in-game. Players will have until June 20 to activate the buff and reap the rewards.
