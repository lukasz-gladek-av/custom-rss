            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bunch of <em>Verge</em> staffers came back from the weekend chatting about our experiences with <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s</em> network tests. We generally enjoyed the fast-paced, co-op-focused spin on <em>Elden Ring</em> that takes cues from roguelikes and battle royale games — and when things were good, they were <em>really</em> good. But we also ran into some frustrating connection issues that we worry could dampen the experience of the full game if they’re not worked out.</p><p>Read more about what we thought below. The game will be officially released on May 30th.</p><p>While playing the <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> network test, the word that kept coming to mind to describe it was “frantic.”</p><p>I played the original <em>Elden Ring</em> at a plodding pace. For every possible encounter, I cast spells from a distance as an astrologer to avoid the scary baddies, and I took advantage of numerous guides to find great gear and easy leveling spots.</p><p>I couldn’t do that with <em>Nightreign</em>; its constant, looming, battle royale-style closing ring of danger forces you to stay moving. The persistent threat of the storm meant I had to make quick decisions about which weapons to experiment with. To get runes to level up, I had to fight enemies head-on, and if I didn’t level up enough, I’d be useless against the fearsome bosses.</p><p>But despite <em>Nightreign</em> forcing me to play differently, I came to love the breakneck speed because of how it pushed me out of my comfort zone. And when I matched up with two other solid players, <em>Nightreign</em> was just awesome: I had a blast mowing through baddies and bosses with a coordinated group, especially when one team I played with easily took down a surprise Fell Omen spawn on the roof of a small keep.</p><p>I only just started to get the hang of <em>Nightreign</em> at the end of the network test. I can’t wait to jump into the full game and experiment with everything it has to offer, even if it means I have to keep being uncomfortable. <em>— Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><p>Like Jay, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s</em> pacing pushed me to play with haste and act braver than I normally do in The Lands Between. But I don’t always<em> want</em> to go that fast. </p><p>I enjoyed my drops into Limveld enough to play over five hours in total. The bulk of this came during the final play session when I partied up with two friends for three nonstop hours. We communicated via Discord to overcome the game’s lack of voice chat (an odd omission, though if the goal is to avoid player toxicity, I can understand it).</p><p>I really like the idea of a co-op <em>Elden Ring</em> that works well in short sessions. The battle royale format forces you to rush and encourages experimentation; with some buddies, it was an absolute thrill. At the same time, this game has no chill. There’s no casually hanging with the boys.</p><p>The trappings of a battle royale in a scaled-down <em>Elden Ring</em> world means you won’t be methodically exploring lengthy, exquisitely designed dungeons. That’s a bummer because to play with seamless co-op in the original game requires dealing with FromSoftware’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/is-elden-ring-co-op-multiplayer/">draconian restrictions</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">installing a mod on PC</a>. <em>Nightreign</em> is obviously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">designed with something else in mind</a>. <em>– Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer</em></p><p>I went into the <em>Nightreign</em> network test with no material history of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> and a bitter taste from my previous attempts at playing Soulslike games. But I was intrigued by the idea of playing the game with a team so we could carry each other through the unforgivably challenging hordes of monsters and bosses.</p><p>It turns out, I was always the one who needed the carrying.</p><p>My kind of fun usually doesn’t involve timely dodges and strategic spellcasting, but I did have a blast following people I’ve matched with who seemed to know what the hell they were doing. They took me all the way to the second day, and we died together against the Fell Omen. They must have revived my sad Wylder no less than 20 times.</p><p>I played the final network test window Sunday night with my colleague Sean Hollister, who is a pretty decent <em>Demon’s / Dark Souls </em>player and beat <em>Elden Ring</em>. We did have fun joking about how you need to smack a player while they’re down to revive them, frantically running away from those damn Flame Chariots, and wondering what our poor third teammate thought of us since they weren’t in our Discord.</p><p>I’m not sure if I’ll come back and play <em>Nightreign</em>. Maybe the menu system could be revamped so that it’s better designed for the fast-paced missions the game puts you through. But really, I just need to figure out how to duck, dip, dive, and dodge. <em>— Umar Shakir, news writer</em></p><p>I’ll admit: I don’t quite get it. Bite-sized co-op <em>Elden Ring</em>, yes, that sounds like an amazing idea. But why force it to fit inside the tired trappings of a battle royale game? The joy of <em>Souls</em> has always been cautious exploration, but now there’s a blue ring of creeping deadly fire keeping me from exploring it meaningfully and a “where we dropping boys?”-style intro to every mission rather than the mystical teleportation that has defined FromSoftware’s worlds. I just can’t feel that immersion when I’m inexplicably hacking at my buddy’s body to raise them when they’re downed — another trope of battle royale that just doesn’t make quite as much sense in a <em>Souls</em> world.</p><p>I <em>did</em> enjoy getting utterly trashed by the game with my colleague Umar — but if I could just as easily play co-op <em>Shadow of the Erdtree, </em>I’d be happier. — <em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><p>I’m really concerned about potential network stability and the overall communication issues in <em>Nightreign</em>. Though I didn’t get to play the network tests, during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">my playtests ahead of that</a>, connectivity issues were frequent and terrible. Based on what I’ve seen from players <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612986/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-be-testing-those-networks">and FromSoftware itself</a>, it seems like some of those issues have persisted.</p><p>Because we could never maintain a stable enough connection for all three members of the party, my team never managed to make it to the boss on the third day. It got so bad that, at one point, after I lost connection for the umpteenth time, I simply quit playing, contenting myself with walking around the testing area to watch others try to do what we couldn’t (and suffering connection issues as well).</p><p>On top of that, there’s no party chat in the game itself. I got around it because I could just talk to the two other players at my table. However, I wondered how randos would get over the lack of communication tools beyond emoting. You really don’t have time to pull up the emote wheel and select “Help me!” when the Fell Omen is chewing on your ass. <em>— Ash Parrish, games reporter</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while there have been several mods since Team Fortress 2 was launched in 2007, Valve has now released the game's entire source code, which may open the door to a lot of fan creations.</p><p>Valve made the announcement on <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2's official page</a>, while noting that the source code gives mods builders "the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions." However, this code is being shared on a non-commercial basis. This means that programmers won't be able to sell creations that were made from Team Fortress 2's foundations. However, the new fan-made mods can be listed in the Steam Store as free releases.</p><p>The line between professional game makers and modders has blurred over the years, and there are definitely talented fans who can probably work wonders, even with an 18-year-old game engine. In 2021, a group of modders took it upon themselves to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-modders-are-recreating-a-version-with-better-graphics-in-source-2/1100-6495075/" data-ref-id="1100-6495075">recreate Team Fortress 2 in Valve's Source 2 game engine</a>. It should be interesting to see if modders can push the Team Fortress 2 code into something that goes far beyond the scope of the original game.</p><p>Last year, players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">review-bombed Team Fortress 2</a> over the game's ongoing issues with bots, which have been a problem for a few years. Regardless, Valve has continued to offer some additional content for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">including new maps</a>, well after most publishers would have declared the title to be finished.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the "double-A" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols podcast</a>, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had "great products," but didn't have many "AAA-level successful products," other than Gran Turismo. "That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games."</p><p dir="ltr">He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.</p><p>The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.</p>

			<p>Techland has announced that starting today, the Tower Raid roguelite co-op mode that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been tested since mid-2024</a> is now available permanently in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. This is part of the franchise's 10th anniversary celebrations and roadmap, which we dived into during <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-10th-anniversary-qa-with-franchise-director-tymon-smektala/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent interview with Techland's Tymon Smektala</a>.</p>
<p>In Tower Raid, Dying Light 2 players won't be playing as the game's regular protagonist, Aiden Caldwell. They will instead choose from four different characters, each belonging to a specific class archetype: Tank, Brawler, Ranger or Specialist. Each comes with their own unique set of skills. Players who really want a challenge may choose to go with a smaller squad than four, or even solo if they want to test themselves against the zombies.</p>
<p>There are three difficulty modes available: Quick, Normal and Elite. This choice affects the length of the session. Each run features a new mix of floors and challenges, ensuring a dynamic experience at every attempt at climbing the Tower.</p>
<p>The developers are also introducing a new progression system that was engineered to reward persistence through runs. With each failure, players unlock new skills and equipment to improve their chances on the challenging run. In the Tower Raid hub, players will also find Sola, a trader offering unique rewards such as the Office Day Outfit, the Kuai Dagger and the Silenced Pistol.</p>

<p>While this is a full release of Tower Raid in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, Techland said it's actively seeking player feedback through the franchise's official social media channels (Facebook, X, Instagram), Discord and Reddit communities to further refine the gameplay experience. In addition, a special survey will be released in a few days to gather further insights from players.</p>
<p>As we learned in the aforementioned interview, the Polish developer still has big plans to update this game despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Summer launch window for the spin-off Dying Light: The Beast. Throughout 2025, Dying Light 2 is getting coop gameplay and matchmaking improvements, Community Map support improvements, new Tower Raid characters, new firearms and melee weapons, a new weapon class, further Prologue improvements, and graphical/technical improvements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pacific Drive Sales Pass the One Million Mark]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pacific-drive-sales-pass-the-one-million-mark.1113585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Games and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that their survival drive-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game has officially passed the one million sales mark. That means it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">picked up another 400,000 sales</a> for itself since July last year, which definitely isn't too shabby for an indie studio like Ironwood.</p>

<p>As Ironwood itself says in the aforementioned press release, the studio has "less than 20 staff", and&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is its first game, which I think makes the game passing the million mark even more impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-1m-night.jpg?itok=lxix-O8t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-1m-night.jpg?itok=xYMS8_GL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has passed the million mark in terms of sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you think Ironwood Studios is done with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, though, think again. The game has already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">received</a> three major updates since release, and the developer is teasing that the "fourth and most substantial update" will launch soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ironwood doesn't provide a specific release window for that update, so we could be waiting quite a while for it. Still, given that this isn't a live service game, it's nice to see the studio supporting it with any kind of post-launch plan.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s success means it's also caught the eye of Hollywood filmmaker James Wan, best known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Saw</em>. His <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">production company acquired the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show back in December.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's an indie survival game in which you must drive your car across the Olympic Exclusion Zone, foraging for resources and dodging anomalies as you go. If you can imagine&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Driver</em>, you're not far off.</p>




<p>The game is as much about repairing your car and making sure it runs alright as it is dodging the horrors of the Zone, so if you're in the market for a game that mixes vehicle maintenance with desperate struggles for your life, this is the one for you.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

It was pitched to the world (and investors) as a <em>Star Trek</em>-like combadge that could tell you the time, answer questions about any topic, translate language on the fly, and even play music. And all of this was done via a single tap on the device and voice commands. If this sounds too good to be true, well, you are apparently smarter than a lot of the people who invested money in this thing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://qz.com/humane-ai-pin-reviews-1851403459&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://qz.com/humane-ai-pin-reviews-1851403459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AI Pin was a disaster</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/TitZV6k8zfA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/TitZV6k8zfA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviews called it bad</a></span> and claimed it was often wrong, assuming it even worked at all.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/valve-releases-full-team-fortress-2-game-code-to-encourage-new-free-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Valve's updates to its classic games evoke Hemingway's two kinds of going bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. Nothing is heard, little is seen, and then, one day, <em>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Day of Defeat</em>, and other Source-engine-based games get a bevy of modern upgrades. Now, the entirety of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> (<em>TF2</em>) client and server game code, a boon for modders and fixers, is also being released.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013">source code</a> allows for more ambitious projects than have been possible thus far, <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve wrote in a blog post</a>. "Unlike the Steam Workshop or local content mods, this SDK gives mod makers the ability to change, extend, or rewrite <em>TF2</em>, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible." The SDK license restricts any resulting projects to "a non-commercial basis," but they can be published on Steam's store as their own entities.</p>
<p>Since it had the tools out, Valve also poked around the games based on that more open source engine and spiffed them up as well. Most games got 64-bit binary support, scalable HUD graphics, borderless window options, and the like. Many of these upgrades come from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/valve-celebrates-25-years-of-half-life-with-feature-packed-steam-update/">the big 25-year anniversary update made to&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em></a>, which included "overbright lighting," gamepad configurations, Steam networking support, and the like.</p>

The deal is specifically for Niantic's games division and not the AR company in its entirety. The purchase would include Niantic's current games as well, including the highly popular Pokemon Go. Both companies declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Niantic partnered with Savvy Games to expand Pokemon Go operations into Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt (via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Pocketgamer.biz</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">This report comes after Niantic has struggled to find success for its titles outside of Pokemon Go.

The deal to purchase Niantic's games division would be one of the larger investments the country has made in an effort to diversify the country's economic investments.</p><p>In 2024 Niantic announced that it had used Pokemon Go player data to train a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/">real-world navigation AI</a>, with the company later stating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want that data used for war</a>.

It said that data was "ethically" sourced from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bleeding Edge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the four-versus-four multiplayer title developed by Ninja Theory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company had previously used player data from the title to drive human-like navigation experiments, but in 2022 apparently started wondering what might happen if that information was funneled into a machine learning model foie gras style.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-announces-ai-gameplay-generation-model-muse.1113531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-muse-ai-gameplay-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced Muse, a generative AI model that can "generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". The company is calling it the first example of a WHAM, or World and Human Action Model.</p>

<p>In a post on the official Microsoft website, the company reveals that Muse was developed in conjunction with <i>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</i>studio Ninja Theory. The model was trained on Ninja Theory's battle arena game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</p>

<p>A followup post on the Xbox website says Muse can "create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI", which Microsoft calls "a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators". I'm not so sure about that one myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=5FC-wPky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=EuWjQAMN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft trained its new AI on the Ninja Theory game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In both posts, Microsoft gives some examples of the kind of gameplay Muse is currently able to generate. Honestly, I might just not be infected by the tech brain worms, but to me it looks pretty low-quality.</p>

<p>It's not just me, either; The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms</a> that Muse is currently only capable of generating gameplay at a paltry 300 x 180 resolution, and not only that, but it's also limited to 10 frames per second. Find me a PC gamer that would be happy with those numbers.</p>

<p>I know, I know. The tech is still in its early stages, and I'm sure that Microsoft will be able to iterate on it in order to create a model that can convincingly generate higher-resolution gameplay at a better frame rate.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I'm still left wondering what the point of it all is. According to Microsoft, it's all about "effectively support[ing] human creatives" and that potential applications include "the opportunity to make older games accessible to future generations of players across new devices and in new ways".</p>

The developers did not give a reason for the layoffs, which came as a shock to the gaming community because of Rivals’ evident success. However, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, NetEase has clarified that the reason was organizational streamlining.</p><p>“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game,” wrote Alex Armour, a PR representative from NetEase Games. “This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.”</p><p>The statement continued by reassuring fans that development on <em>Rivals</em> would continue with a core group of developers based in China. “We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game.”</p><p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">According to a report in <em>VentureBeat</em></a> though, organizational streamlining doesn’t give the full picture of what’s going on, with sources claiming the real reason for the layoffs is that NetEase executives are no longer confident in overseas development teams.

I can never remember the technical term for that wibbly effect you get in PS1 games when you sidle up to surfaces and look askance at the textures. I thought it was "dithering", but Brendy says that's not what dithering is you sap, you absolute dunce. If you know the answer, please educate me in a comment. But first, try Blue Wyrm.</p>
<p>It's a free first-person melee dungeon crawler from SaintPesticide. It's awash with rich, diseased shades of ruby, amethyst and malachite. And brother, it has not-dithering to spare. Here's a video.

In Blue Wyrm you play the Red Knight Gabriel, who is trying to rescue her wife, the Blue Knight Lucia, from a crypt populated by hissing marionettes, green diamonds and photon-spitting sentries. Gabriel is equipped with a sword that handles like an oversized ice pick, tinking off surfaces in a musical way. She can swipe left and right or stab forward by pressing the left, right and mouse-wheel buttons respectively. If you chain together all three kinds of attack in a single combo, you'll leach health from the body of your assailant.
</p>
<p>
This is vital, because Gabriel ain't so hot at defending. She's a fast runner and she can double-jump, but she can't dodge, parry or block. Or at least, these abilities were not available in the 20 minutes I spent with the Itch build, during which I spent a lot of time cooing over the fittings. Blue Wyrm is a gorgeous piece of work, the kind of lurid imagineering that blows the dust from senses deadened by overmuch photorealism. Calling it "PS1-esque" bleaches away the specificity. That said, I <em>really</em> need to see this running on a CRT.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-revolutionary-games-ai-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Elon Musk recently expressed his intention to ‘make video games great again’ on the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022. It has been just a few weeks since Elon Musk admitted to cheating in games like Path of Exile and Diablo, and despite being a contributor to problematic areas of the industry, he now intends to found an AI-powered dev studio.</p>



<p>In a recent post, the ‘xAI’ profile invited users to email in to chase jobs revolving around ‘designing AI games first principles’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-potential-is-incredible">‘The Potential is Incredible’</h2>



<p>Elon Musk was aired out a couple of weeks ago for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">cheating by sharing his accounts</a> in Path of Exile and Diablo. He didn’t care about the revelation going public, and now he has decided to single-handedly save the gaming industry, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891396362404565341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaning on the quip</a> made famous by his new best friend, President Donald Trump:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s got to be done. </p>



<p>Make video games great again!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Trump, Musk lacks originality in the attempted coining of that phrase. The billionaire tech titan made this comment in response to a post suggesting that he’s ‘fed up with woke politics and DEI destroying the games industry’.</p>



<p>And of course, these comments came days after Musk branded games journalism as ‘garbage’. And to think I once branded him one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/">most successful streamers in history</a>!</p>



<p>Musk followed up today with <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892087111055974879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another bold statement</a> on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join us to make revolutionary video games using AI. </p>



<p>The potential for a dynamically generated video game using AI is incredible!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many users commented on these posts hoping that the use of AI would be confined to ‘backend processes’ to better automate a human-led development ecosystem, but that’s probably not the case. Elon Musk is no stranger to cleaning house and stripping teams down to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, the space-mad, eccentric billionaire would probably have Grok manufacture entire games at the press of a button. The scary thing is, that he’s surrounded by such capable people that it’s probably not too far from becoming a reality.</p>



<p>What do you think about Elon Musk’s desire to ‘make gaming great again?’ Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The WHAM, Katja Hofmann, Senior Principal Research Manager and lead of the Microsoft Research Game Intelligence team, said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, is a generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft calls this generative AI model Muse, which was developed by the Microsoft Research Game Intelligence and Teachable AI Experiences (Tai X) teams in collaboration with Hellblade developer Ninja Theory. It’s open sourcing the weights and sample data and making the executable available for the WHAM Demonstrator — a concept prototype that provides a visual interface for interacting with WHAM models and multiple ways of prompting the models.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company provided a number of gameplay clips showing what Muse is capable of. Currently, the model can generate “complex gameplay sequences that are consistent over several minutes” just by prompting the model with 10 initial frames (one second) of human gameplay and the controller actions of the whole play sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game used to train Muse was Ninja Theory’s 2020 multiplayer game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. “We worked closely with our colleagues at Ninja Theory and with Microsoft compliance teams to ensure that the data was collected ethically and used responsibly for research purposes,” Hofmann insisted.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/wham-gen-2-1739980350168.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Muse was trained on Bleeding Edge, and early results look very close.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s been amazing to see the variety of ways Microsoft Research has used the Bleeding Edge environment and data to explore novel techniques in a rapidly moving AI industry,” said Gavin Costello, technical director at Ninja Theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From the hackathon that started it all, where we first integrated AI into Bleeding Edge, to building AI agents that could behave more like human players, to the World and Human Action Model being able to dream up entirely new sequences of Bleeding Edge gameplay under human guidance, it’s been eye-opening to see the potential this type of technology has.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muse is used in “world model mode” meaning it is used to predict how the game will evolve from the initial prompt sequence. The more closely the generated gameplay sequence resembles the actual game, the more accurately Muse has captured the dynamics of that game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/wham-gen-1-1739980217611.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An example of what Muse is currently capable of.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest and most controversial topics in the creative industries. As video game development costs rise, publishers are increasingly looking to AI tools to speed up work and cut costs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Call of Duty reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic" for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> in late 2023, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">fans accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen last year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>, and just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments">Capcom said it was experimenting with generative AI</a> to create the "hundreds of thousands" of ideas needed for in-game environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything">weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is all-in on generative AI, as anyone with even a cursory knowledge of ChatGPT and OpenAI will be aware of, and so this development with Ninja Theory comes as little surprise. Still, the company will face tough questions from some within the video game development community who are worried models like Muse will put them out of a job.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the blog post, Hofmann insisted that Microsoft's team “focus on exploring the capabilities that models like Muse need to effectively support human creatives.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look forward to seeing the many ways in which the community will explore these models and build on our research," Hofmann continued. "I cannot wait to see all the ways that these models and subsequent research will help shape and increase our understanding of how generative AI models of human gameplay may support gameplay ideation and pave the way for future, novel, AI-based game experiences, including the use cases that our colleagues at Xbox have already started to explore.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has commented on Microsoft's relatively new strategy whereby it launches some of its first-party games on rival platforms, including PS5. For Microsoft, this is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">making money and bringing its games to more people</a>. It's also a win for PS5 owners, according to Yoshida.</p><p>"I think it's a win for PlayStation owners; they didn't have access [to those games] before," he said on the Sacred Symbols podcast, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshida-xbox-games-on-ps5-a-win-for-playstation-owners/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p>Yoshida was at one point managing Sony's first-party game production pipeline before he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536">switched positions to running the indies team</a>. When he was running first-party, Yoshida said it was a "nightmare" scenario for PlayStation to become "the minority platform" because that would make it "impossible to maintain the first-party development because the best creators would leave."</p><p>He added: "They are not just creatives, they are business people as well; they want their games to reach the biggest audience as well."</p><p>Microsoft, of course, is in last place as it relates to console sales among the big three, with PS5 and Switch sales outpacing the Series X|S. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">no longer trying to get PS5 owners to switch to Xbox</a> but instead wants to bring more of Microsoft's first-party games to PS5 to meet them where they are.</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing a more platform-agnostic strategy for many years already but only recently has the company actually begun releasing more and more games for PS5 and Switch. For its part, Sony continues to focus on exclusives for its own platforms, while also bringing more games to PC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6143">day-and-date titles for its live-service games. </a></p><p>One of the next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes to PS5 this spring following its debut on Xbox in 2024. After that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> comes out in May for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, launching on all platforms at the same time.</p><p>The RPG Avowed from Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian launched on February 18, but it has not been announced for any platforms outside of Xbox and PC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Xbox have <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> their new generative AI model, Muse, which is the world's first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World and Human Action Model (WHAM)</a>. Muse's stated purpose is to help out studios by generating gameplay during the development process. Microsoft also claimed the technology might be capable of preserving long-unplayable games on obsolete systems.</p><p>It was trained using developer Ninja Theory's now-dormant and abandoned Bleeding Edge game. The developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-theory-drops-bleeding-edge-to-focus-on-hellblade-2-and-other-projects/1100-6486869/" data-ref-id="1100-6486869">dropped support for the game</a> back in 2021 to focus on newer projects. Ninja Theory partnered up with Microsoft Research due to their close proximity to each other in Cambridge, England. Muse used Bleeding Edge to learn about game physics and reactions to players' controller actions.</p><p>According to Xbox, Muse is used for gameplay ideation, and it's already being used to develop a real-time playable AI model trained on other first-party games. Xbox also mentioned how Muse could possibly take older games lost to time and older hardware from its first-party portfolio and optimize them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c15vxDHJ2lU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Xbox claimed that Muse would help teams prototype new gameplay experiences during development and introduce new content. Xbox noted that it's up to its studios whether to participate in the use of generative AI based on their goals and vision, and acknowledged that AI won't be the single solution for every project.</p><p>For Ninja Theory, studio head Dom Matthews said, "It's not about using AI to generate content, but it's actually about creating workflow and approaches that allow our team here of 100 creative experts to do more."</p><p>The subject of AI still remains controversial. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">recent study</a> showed that a majority of game studios already use generative AI, but workers are concerned about how AI could impact their roles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft president Brad Smith</a> have said that the rise of AI would displace workers in the short term but lead to more opportunities in the long term. (Although not tied directly to AI, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 individuals</a> in gaming roles last year.) Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember the Humane AI pin, which gave the worst people you know a small crisis back in April 2024 when a reviewer <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it a bad review</a>? Well, it’s over now.&nbsp;</p><p>Humane announced <a href="https://humane.com/media/humane-hp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday</a> that it’s been bought by HP for $116 million, which will purchase Humane’s “AI-powered platform Cosmos, highly skilled technical talent, and intellectual property with more than 300 patents and patent applications.” Those people “will form HP IQ, HP’s new AI innovation lab focused on building an intelligent ecosystem across HP’s products and services for the future of work.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not an engineer at Humane who is going to become an engineer at HP, but instead an owner of the Humane AI pin, well, tough shit. Humane <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34243204841997-Ai-Pin-Consumers-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promptly discontinued</a> sales of the pin, and after February 28 the pin will stop connecting to Humane’s servers and lose what appears to be pretty much all of its functionality except telling you the battery level of a device that doesn’t do anything. Humane writes that anyone whose device is within the 90-day order window can get a refund, but everyone else is out of luck. In response to the FAQ question “What should I do with my AI Pin once it stops working?” Humane encourages buyers to “recycle your Ai Pin through an e-waste recycling program.” If you want to use your AI pin to locate an e-waste recycling center, you’d better act fast.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172718/humane-ai-pin-selling-hp-rumor-1-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> notes that “The $116 million HP is paying pales next to the $230 million [Humane] raised since it was founded in 2018. (There was a rumor last spring that Humane was trying to sell to HP <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172718/humane-ai-pin-selling-hp-rumor-1-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for somewhere near $1 billion</a>.)” Going from buzzy tech startup to cramming AI functionality into printers that <a href="https://aftermath.site/printers-suck-so-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already barely work</a> is a pretty hard fall from grace,&nbsp; a fall marred by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24211339/humane-ai-pin-more-daily-returns-than-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returns outpacing sales</a> and a <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Humane-Recalls-Charge-Case-Accessory-for-Ai-Pin-Due-to-Lithium-Battery-Fire-Hazard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charger recall</a> to boot. My first thought at seeing the news yesterday was that the remnants of Humane are now going to use AI to make my printer worse, a task I do not think is possible, but if anyone can do it, it’s them.</p><p>The early review controversy around the Humane AI pin felt like it centered around all of us regular people not <em>believing</em> in the product enough, not giving AI the benefit of the doubt its hucksters so regally believe they deserve. And in this case, we were right! Whatever marginal improvements the pin made after its launch, it was never a useful product that did anything near what it promised, and reviewers like Marques Brownlee were right to call it out. If there’s a lesson to be learned from this, it’s that we should point out when the emperor isn’t wearing clothes more often.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll start: As I write this, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2025/feb/14/guardian-media-group-announces-strategic-partnership-with-openai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> has entered into a deal with OpenAI, and The New York Times is <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/02/16/2025/new-york-times-goes-all-in-on-internal-ai-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushing AI products on its writers</a> despite the fact that it’s <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/02/the-new-york-times-will-let-reporters-use-ai-tools-while-its-lawyers-litigate-ai-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still embroiled in lawsuits</a> over AI. Both join the <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">host</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-future-chatgpt-pc-gamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outlets</a> jumping on the rickety bandwagon so as not to miss out on a future that, as Aftermath pal Ed Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/longcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote </a>earlier this week, keeps not coming. AI companies are burning piles of cash and swathes of the environment to bring us non-functional gadgets and <a href="https://www.indignity.net/the-washington-post-burns-its-own-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dodgy</a> summaries and <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-search-god-no-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">useless searches</a> and so much <a href="https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slop</a>, and all of it shows <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5279550/openai-touts-new-government-partnership-and-support-for-a-i-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sign of stopping</a> despite what utter bullshit it is. The Humane pin might be in a different field than all this, its fate having far less ramifications than the destruction of journalism and the loss of journalists’ jobs, but it highlights what happens when AI’s promises don’t come to pass: The tech barons sell what scraps they can to some other sucker, and regular people are left with something not only useless, but <em>worse</em> than before, whether that’s <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/01/inside-a-network-of-ai-generated-newsletters-targeting-small-town-america/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the degradation of local news</a> or a $700 wearable the company has completely washed its hands of.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know how us regular folks actually stop all this from happening, beyond refusing to engage with these products that are becoming <a href="https://www.404media.co/opting-out-of-gmails-gemini-ai-summaries-is-a-mess-heres-how-to-do-it-we-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more unavoidable</a> by the day. But we can at least refuse to sing the chorus of “early days” and “obviously it will get better” AI makers need of us and call these products out as the bullshit they are.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-stonks-shares-closures-store"><h3>GameStop Is A Very 21st Century Company</h3></a><p>And also has the most predictable trajectory</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</h5><p><span>18 February, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Diving into <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> Part One "Bloom," I had a lot of high hopes. I love story-based games where you have to make decisions that will have consequences later down the line. The aesthetic of this game also really pulled me in. I love games that have that retro feel and are full of neon vibrancy that is reminiscent of the 90s. Despite being neon, it has a beautiful muted feel to it at times and really provides the grittiness and dated feel to help you travel back in time.</p>
<p>Loading the game for the first time, you're immediately pulled into a gritty cutscene, giving you glimpses of the events that took place that summer. As soon as that unraveled before me, my interest was peaked. It slows right down quickly soon after that, as you play as Swann gets a phone call from her mother. Examining items in the car, I immediately noticed the masks and became very aware that it took place during the pandemic, a time I would much rather forget. For those who had a difficult time during the pandemic, this game may prove to be a little bit uncomfortable at times, with the reminders that crop up throughout the story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_3efe444163d418f162a8ec19c4a7039c444b93e2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After the scene in the car, you are introduced to Swann as a teenager who loves to film everything she can with her camcorder. This was something that I spent a lot of time doing. Getting to see the environments through the camcorder was a lot of fun and very nostalgic. It also reminded me a lot of Life is Strange, and the collectibles being in the form of photographs. Instead, you would film a bunch of scenes of life happening around Velvet Cove to create a memoir. Whether this was birds, items moving in place, or your gang of friends, there were lots of optional memoirs to create alongside the story-based ones.</p>
<p>What really helped elevate the game's aesthetic was the art style that went with it. While music played an important part in the game, having the color schemes of the 90s helped bring the game to life. I loved the lighting that was used to reflect off of objects in the world, as well as the characters. Seeing Nora, Kat, Autumn, and Swann bathed in neon lights was one of my favorite aspects of the game, and it made me happy to see that a photo mode had been implemented into Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>
<p>Getting to examine items from around the world, such as the books and videotapes in Swann's bedroom, helped me remember my own childhood and fond memories of mixtapes, CDs, and videotapes. I loved the amount of detail that went into every little thing that you could examine. Whether it was a beer bottle in the park or a book in Swann's room, there was so much detail, and love poured into this game to help provide a true, immersive experience in the 90s. Every recording helped to build the world up further, as well as provide beneficial evidence in tough situations.</p>
<p>While the game is quite a slow burn, it helps set up the story for the second episode, which I am eagerly awaiting. There's a lot of unanswered questions, and I'm excited to see where this supernatural tale will end.</p>

<p>That being said, there were moments in Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage that were a little awkward. With games that rely on your choices impacting the story, there are often a lot of pauses to allow you time to respond. However, in this game, the conversations feel a little bit too drawn out, even when I'm not actively contributing to the conversation. Pauses are long, and conversations often overlap. While this would make sense since it's a group of people all talking to each other, sometimes the option to give a response comes in a bit too late, and it feels wrong to contribute to the conversation. I found this to be an issue predominantly with Swann, as she is quite an awkward teenager and is very nervous around people.</p>
<p>In addition to this, some of the animations for the conversations were a little bit wonky. For example, when you finally meet up with Autumn at the bar in Velvet Cove, sometimes you can hear the voice-over of the conversation that is taking place, but her mouth isn't moving. Alternatively, her mouth moves after a delay, and she only says half of the sentence or after it has already been said. While these issues were relatively minor, they did break the game's immersion and lessen the impact of conversations, as it became something I focused on.</p>
<p>Although it's to be expected, I did wish that the game had a save option rather than relying solely on autosaves. Because of this, it meant that saves were pretty few and far between, meaning I had to commit to some beefy gaming sessions to make progress in the story, as well as having to get to a certain point before the game was saved.</p>

<p>Overall, getting to experience the conversations between the girls was a lot of fun and reminded me a lot of my own childhood and adolescence, just without the supernatural elements to go along with it. The game is very aesthetically pleasing, and there is a ton of optional content that you can do within the time frame of playing the main game due to the function of the camcorder.</p>
<p>Certain parts did feel a little bit drawn out, especially the scene of Swann and Autumn collecting Autumn's keys. A lot of that scene was Swann and Autumn reminiscing on the past and how they became friends at that very moment. Despite that, it felt like it ran on longer than it needed to, which really added to the slow-burn effect of walking through their adolescence.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/">playing as adults</a>, it felt like it progressed a bit quicker, and the scenes in adulthood weren't as long as those in adolescence. I look forward to seeing how this story will conclude in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second tape</a>, and I hope I get to hunt for more collectibles again.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Xbox have announced a new generative AI technology known as Muse that could help with game preservation. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> going over the new tech, Microsoft says that there is a belief that Muse can change how games are preserved and how players experience classic titles.</p>



<p>“Today, countless classic games tied to aging hardware are no longer playable by most people,” Fatima Kardar, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of gaming AI said. “Thanks to this breakthrough, we are exploring the potential for Muse to take older back catalog games from our studios and optimize them for any device.”</p>



<p>Due to it still being early in hits lifecycle, no examples of how exactly the Muse technology can work with game preservation on Xbox were shared, but it seems like Microsoft is gung ho about the possibilities.</p>



<p>“We believe this could radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future and make them accessible to more players,” Kardar said. “To imagine that beloved games lost to time and hardware advancement could one day be played on any screen with Xbox is an exciting possibility for us.”</p>



<p>If you want to read more about the Muse technology, Microsoft has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full research blog</a> on what went into its development.</p>
