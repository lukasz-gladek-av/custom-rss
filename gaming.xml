            <p>Tiny Garden is bringing back the spirit of Polly Pocket with a cutesy farming sim game set inside a virtual plastic clamshell inspired by the nineties toy phenomenon.</p>

<p>Spanish developers Ao Norte’s adorable game imagines a world in which the iconic hinged mini-dioramas are ecosystems of their own able to grow crops, as players sow seeds before turning the handle on the side of the clasped toy to help carrots, lettuces and all other manner of plants and vegetables spring up. (Nice find, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-garden-looks-like-an-adorable-polly-pocket-full-of-sunshine-for-pc-and-switch">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>The objective is simply comfort and customisation, with no defined scoring or challenges to speak of. Harvesting crops gathers more seeds, with the chance to discover new plants - including rare shiny plants, Pokemon style - and complement your garden with furniture and other decorations acquired by trading your crops.</p>
<p>Certain plants can also terraform the gridded landscape, allowing for more arid solid to plant cacti in, verdant grass and bushes, or water created by fountains to grow water lilies and other aquatic flora.</p>

<p>Ao Norte explicitly describe the game as being as compact as the clamshells that serve as its levels, saying not to expect hundreds of hours of unique gameplay from the “tiny game by a tiny team”. Still, it sounds like there should be plenty for anyone after a relaxing few hours to pass the time with at least.</p>
<p>Tiny Garden has already passed its modest funding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aonorte/tiny-garden-build-your-own-magical-garden-inside-a-90s-toy">over on Kickstarter</a>, with Ao Norte aiming for a release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812450/Tiny_Garden/">Steam</a> and Itch.io next February for the relaxing farming toybox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-development-of-varsity-high-school-football-part-1/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Football fans are a passionate group. That goes double when it comes to football video game fans. With so few options over the last two decades, players get restless whenever a new game is announced and in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They want a game that is feature rich while being fun to play on the field. Often, however, they get something that is one or the other. With Varsity High School Football, developers Spear Interactive and Pyramid Lake Games are hoping to change that.</p>



<p>Varsity High School Football is taking a sport that millions love, and bringing it to the most-played level in America: High School. Featuring thousands of schools representing every county in the United States, Varsity is aiming to be one of the deepest football games you’ve ever played.</p>



<p>Recently I was invited up to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where Spear Interactive is located, to get an exclusive look at the game, play some of what’s built, and talk about its development.</p>



<p>Varsity will be centered around its gameplay and Dynasty mode (more on that coming soon). For the gameplay, the developers are stopping at nothing to make it as realistic of an experience as possible for a studio of its size.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>An exclusive screenshot for Varsity High School Football</figcaption></figure>



<p>They’re motion capturing every aspect of the gameplay with suits and equipment that cost tens of thousands of dollars. From the quarterbacks to offensive and defensive line interactions, what you see in game will have been motion captured. To help with that realism, they’re using actual football players from the Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL) to get the captures with thousands of different animations coming in.</p>



<h2 id="h-varsity-on-the-field-feels-smooth">Varsity On The Field Feels Smooth</h2>



<p>When speaking to one of the game’s lead developers, it was emphasized that getting “tight motions and smooth player movement” was as important as anything else they’re working on. Even if they have to capture the same thing dozens of times, it’s something they want to make sure they get right.</p>



<p>One concern I had with capturing players that are as old as 22 years old – the max age for the CJFL – is the speed. Obviously, older players are going to be faster and more powerful, on average, than your typical high school athlete. To make sure the play isn’t hindered by that and it’s on par with what you’d expect, they manually adjust custom-developed sliders for things like overall game speed, agility, and more. Think of it like what games offer with sliders for play, and amplify it. It’s all being done behind the scenes within the Unity-built game.</p>



<p>For the sake of transparency, the build I played had just the quarterback and wide receivers on the field. There was no defense, no line, and no real challenge. What it was, however, was a solid showcase of the detail going into every position on the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing, and feeling, the way the quarterback moves in and around the pocket – a position they’ve spent the most work with so far – was impressive. Footwork felt and looked natural, and the throwing motions were as smooth as any independent football game I’ve ever played.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t want to hype it up too much, but it was satisfying to watch how the throws were made. Receiver animations were still being worked on, but, with what was there, the catches looked good when doing crossing and similar routes. Even how the players run, an aspect that many football games struggle to accurately create, looked pretty natural.  And while playing, it was once again reiterated that it was all about getting the tight motions and smooth player movement, something that it feels like Varsity is on its way to achieving.</p>



<p>There’s no release date set for Varsity, and that’s by design. It was made clear during my time with the team that the last thing they wanted was to announce a date too soon and have to push it back should something come up. Instead, they’ll continue to work on the game, have playtests with select supporters from its <a href="https://www.patreon.com/varsityvideogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Patreon</a>, and share progress with fans each month.</p>



<p>As far as the game’s other major selling point, Dynasty Mode, there’s a lot to unpack. And unpack it we will.</p>

These shields allow players to both attack and defend at once, and two-handed thrusting shield builds are especially powerful, allowing players to perform lunging stabs that deal major damage, all while still guarding from enemy attacks. And when you throw certain talisman or flask benefits on top of that (such as the Two-Handed Sword Talisman or the Deflecting Hardtear), the build becomes even more powerful.</p><p>Thrusting shields are so good, they enabled one player to beat Messmer...<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-doot-champion-drdecomposing-has-officially-murdered-the-dlcs-most-brutal-boss-with-a-saxophone">using a saxophone as a controller.</a></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WE DOOTED HIM</p><p>At long last: after only 30 minutes of trying, I defeated Messmer the Impaler using an electric saxophone as a controller.</p><p>No summons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/03/battlefield-3-4-and-hardline-are-being-delisted-from-playstation-3-and-xbox-360<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battlefield_3/b/xbox360/archive/2011/10/26/review.aspx">Battlefield 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battlefield_4/b/pc/archive/2013/10/28/holding-the-line.aspx">Battlefield 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battlefield_hardline/b/playstation4/archive/2015/03/20/battlefield-hardline-review-game-informer.aspx">Battlefield: Hardline</a>, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.</p>

<p>It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.</p>

            <p>It’s been a good while since we last got a proper Transformers video game, with the four years since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM</a>-ish Transformers: Battlegrounds in 2020 only seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/transformers-online">long-in-the-works</a> MMO Transformers Online finally biting the dust. That’s about to change, with the reveal of a curious new combination of racer and roguelike starring the robots in disguise.</p>

<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials somehow marks the first time the vehicular bots have featured in a racing game, though as you might expect from a franchise known for switching between forms it’s not quite a pure driving experience, either.</p>
<p>Instead, developers 3DClouds are billing the game as a mixture of traditional racing game and action-RPG  as the vehicular robots speed around tracks before shifting into their bot forms to fight through groups of enemies standing in the way of the finish line. There’ll apparently be roguelike progression in the form of Prime relics to collect to level up certain skills, while also unlocking extra characters - both Autobots and Decepticons - and skins for said characters.</p>

<p>Galactic Trials will launch with two modes: a titular single-player mode working through the 10 included levels and an Arcade offering with two-player local multiplayer in quick races, with the option to customise the available tracks, weapons and characters. “Location-based specialised tournaments” will also be a thing, though I’m honestly not sure how that translates to just two players being able to play in the same room - this might just be a word-salad way of saying that you can create bracket-based tournaments for bigger groups, perhaps.</p>
<p>2024 is apparently the Transformers series’ 40th anniversary, with Galactic Trials arriving on October 11th. After a relative drought of Transformers video games, there’s a chance we’ll see more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-studio-splash-damage-are-making-a-transformers-action-game">Splash Damage’s co-op shooter Transformers: Reactivate</a>, too, after its planned closed beta slipped out of last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-addresses-spiderbot-concerns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When  XDefiant released its major patch for Season 1, it ended up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/op-xdefiant-ability-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making one of its abilities</a> — spiderbot — even more powerful. It’s led to a lot of discourse online about why it was done and if/when it should be fixed.</p>



<p>The conversation has gotten so loud that even executive producer Mark Rubin has <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1808511436173529112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to Twitter</a> to address players.</p>



<p>In his post, Rubin explained that what players were able to do against the spiderbot when XDefiant first launched wasn’t actually supposed to be allowed. It was a bug that ultimately got fixed with Season 1, taking away a defense against them. </p>



<p>“[T]here was also a bug in that meleeing them was way harder than it was supposed to be,” he said. “So we wanted to keep the bug of shooting them off your own face in the game until we fixed other spiderbot issues.”</p>



<p>Rubin added that taking away a “important counter” was unintentional, and that it will be reverted as part of the game’s next “non-emergency patch”. The reversion will return the ability to shoot them off by shooting at your feet. </p>



<p>“The other changes to spiderbot will remain. i.e. longer cooldown, etc.,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p>You can read his full statement below:</p>



<p><em>“OK now that we’ve gotten through the patch and Ranked is now live, I want to talk about the Spiderbots.</em></p>



<p><em>“So when the game launched there was a bug that you could shoot down at your feet and destroy the spiderbot. This was not intended. However, there was also a bug in that meleeing them was way harder than it was supposed to be. So we wanted to keep the bug of shooting them off your own face in the game until we fixed other spiderbot issues.</em></p>



<p><em>“However, the bug fix got integrated into the Season 1 patch and so an important counter was removed unintentionally. We are reverting that fix in the next non-emergency patch. So you will again be able to shoot them off your own face by shooting at your feet. The other changes to spiderbot will remain. i.e. longer cooldown, etc. </em></p>



<p><em>“For the future, we are going to change the way spiderbot works so that there is a easier and clearer way to get them off you own face. But until then the bug where you can shoot them off your own face will remain. </em></p>



<p><em>“And we will continue to find other ways to balance all of the abilities over time.”</em></p>

        <p>Sequel N1RVAnn-A development is on pause for the moment, say Sukeban Games</p>

            <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-va-11-hall-a-cyberpunk-bartender-action">cyberpunk bartending gem</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/va-11-hall-a">VA-11 Hall-A</a> have revealed their next game, and it looks a doozy. .45 Parabellum Bloodhound draws its inspiration from PlayStation masterpiece Parasite Eve in offering a mix of real-time and turn-based combat dubbed as “active time action”.</p>

<p>Sukeban Games acknowledge the influence of Parasite Eve - which emerged from a  collaboration between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy series</a> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> director Takashi Tokita, among other JRPG veterans - as a key foundation for the upcoming game, but insist “that’s about where comparisons end” without giving any further details for now. Still, the clips of combat in <a href="https://sukeban.moe/index.php/2024/07/03/parabellum/">the announcement post</a> definitely recall both the look and vibe of the 1998 Square Enix gem, with the player character’s action bar needing to fill as they freely run around and evade before pausing to select an action and target in a polygonal target zone.</p>
<p>That player character is ex-merc Reila Mikazuchi, who takes a last chance at returning to her mercenary ways before having things complicated by the realisation that “the real enemy isn’t in front of her gun”. Reila will be able to explore the game’s world across a set of seven chapters and various moody environments (with secrets hidden around), running into “hand-placed encounters” rather than random battles. Each level will also conclude with a boss battle, in classic RPG fashion.</p>
<p>Sukeban said that the game has been in the works for around two years - discounting a few ditched variations before that - with .45 Parabellum Bloodhound aiming for more of “a uniquely ‘Sukeban’ experience” in comparison to the many references and pastiches in VA-11 Hall-A. (The explicit Parasite Eve gameplay root aside.)</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sukeban Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The devs are yet to put even a rough release date on the game, citing a desire to “not repeat a N1rvannA situation” - a brief update on the VA-11 Hall-A sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valhalla-sequel-nirvanna-announced">announced back in 2018</a> expresses that the studio are all-in on .45 Parabellum Bloodhound for the foreseeable, which is “significantly ahead in development” and now taking the devs’ full attention.</p>
<p>“I was actually gonna wait until we had the entire game built before announcing it Officially, but selling games has become much harder. It’s not 2016 anymore, so if we want this game to have a chance we gotta start now and hoard those wishlists and shit,” Sukeban wrote, before giving a release expectation of: “In short: When It’s Done.”</p>
<p>As someone who came late to Parasite Eve, only actually playing it in the last few years as I filled out my endless to-do list of cult classics and nineties gems, it still holds up extremely well in terms of combat and atmosphere. Still, parts have undoubtedly aged, and it’s surprising that few games - aside from its own sequels - have taken its excellent battle system as a leaping-off point for a modern successor. From this early tease, .45 Parabellum Bloodhound looks like a very promising way to carry the torch, from its stylistically low-res textures and low camera angles to the cyberpunk text treatment and vivid colours of your status bars. Count me in.</p>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches in October, and it appears the character teases aren’t done yet from Sega. </p>



<p>“The Japanese [Sonic X Shadow Generations] site showcases both sides of the game, interestingly teasing that another character may be playable (?) in Shadow Generations,” Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/TailsChannel/status/1808521435922514220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TailsChannel posted</a>. </p>

<p>The character tease appears on the Shadow side of the of the landing page while the Sonic page has both the modern and classic Sonic designs. The Shadow side of the website shows Shadow the Hedgehog with a blank box with the text “Coming Soon”.  Based on screenshots from the game, Metal Sonic will be in the game, but it’s unknown if there are plans to make him a playable character or just an NPC enemy. Nevertheless, there is plenty of speculation on the matter happening on social media.</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC. The game features a brand-new story campaign for Shadow along with “iconic 2D and 3D stages” from past Sonic games.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/goddess-of-victory-nikke-announces-collaboration-event-with-dave-the-diver<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The third-person sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke is teaming up with Dave the Diver for a collaborative event. The event launches with the summer update on July 4, and perfect for summertime, it adds a brand-new minigame set underwater that combines the gameplay of Dave the Diver with the characters of Nikke.</p><p>If you haven’t had the chance to check out Goddess of Victory: Nikke yet, it’s a free-to-play RPG available on iOS, Android, and PC. You play as a commander leading a squad of soldiers called Nikkes into battle against alien invaders. You can switch between Nikkes to fire their respective guns or use their unique abilities to complete missions in an effort to take back Earth.</p><p>Nikke’s latest collab is with Dave the Diver, an action-adventure game that has you spend your days diving into an ever-changing body of water and using a harpoon gun to catch fish of varying types and sizes. You then spend your nights working at a local sushi restaurant, where you determine the menu based on what fish you caught.</p><p>To celebrate their new collaboration, Yoo HyungSuk — Director of Goddess of Victory: Nikke — and Jaeho Hwang — Director of Dave The Diver — answered some questions about what brought them together, their plans for the future, and more.</p><h3><strong>Can you share the story behind Nikke’s collaboration with Dave the Diver? How did this opportunity arise?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Nikke and Dave the Diver are both games developed in Korea. We happened to discuss a collaboration because our Nikke team generally loves creative games, and naturally, we also enjoyed playing Dave the Diver. Additionally, Dave the Diver combines casual management gameplay with its diving mechanics, making it an excellent fusion of different gameplay styles. Nikke has also continuously tried to bring new experiences to players through various types of casual minigames in different versions, including a survival minigame for its first anniversary and a tower defense minigame for its 1.5-year anniversary. We hope to bring players different experiences by collaborating with Dave the Diver and learning from their expertise. So we're honored to have this collaboration project.</p><h3><strong>Were your team members familiar with Nikke before the collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang:</strong> Many of us in the team are players of Nikke, so when we received the collaboration proposal, it's fair to say we felt both anticipation and concern. This is because the platforms and art styles of the two games are quite different. Previously, Nikke collaborations have mainly focused on storytelling and characters, but we were curious about how this collaboration could integrate Dave’s gameplay into Nikke.</p><p>However, after receiving the test build, we saw that the Nikke development team had blended Dave and Nikke very well, creating a wonderful synergy between the two games. We are deeply grateful for this and are even more excited about this collaboration event.</p><h3><strong>What is the idea behind each collaboration with Nikke?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Our goal is to maximize the enjoyment of the collaborative IP as much as possible. While we are creators of these games and cultural content, we are first and foremost users of games and cultural content. We respect the works we collaborate with and hope that through Nikke, you can once again experience the intentions and fun of the original work. We look forward to more diverse and exciting collaboration opportunities in the future.</p><h3><strong>Will there be any special events or activities in Dave the Diver to complement this collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang</strong>: Of course, we plan to bring Nikke-themed boat skin into Dave The Diver. Please look forward to it!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>What gameplay or characteristic elements are expected to be included that can bring players a new experience?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Since it is a collaboration between the two games, you'll be able to see scenes featuring both Dave the Diver and the Nikke characters together. Additionally, diving as a Nikke character instead of Dave will offer a different kind of fun. We incorporated the fishing and sushi restaurant operation gameplay of Dave the Diver into Nikke, designing a brand-new minigame that combines the characteristics of Nikke characters and weapons. We hope this will surprise and delight players.</p><h3><strong>How would you evaluate the special edition Diver Nikke (Mast, Anchor, Helm) released by Nikke?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang: </strong>Dave the Diver doesn't have many female characters, so we're delighted to see the charming  female diver characters in Nikke. In particular, the team responded very well to Mast's outfit. It turns out that a wetsuit can be both cute and sexy! Who knows, maybe Duff will end up liking Nikke's characters more than Leahs!</p><h3><strong>What were some of the biggest challenges you encountered during the game's development, particularly with the Dave the Diver crossover?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We put in a lot of effort to present Dave the Diver in the world of Nikke faithfully. Nikke is available on both PC and mobile platforms, so it was challenging and rewarding at the same time to produce an enjoyable Dave the Diver experience on mobile platforms as well.</p><h3><strong>Given the distinct styles of Nikke and Dave the Diver, how did you manage to merge them seamlessly?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> The gameplay of Nikke and Dave the Diver may seem significantly different from each other, but they are in fact similar in some ways. For example, both games feature shooting elements to some extent. This time, we have combined Dave's underwater weapons with the unique characteristics of Nikke characters' weapons, allowing players to experience a differentiated diving and fishing experience by operating different Nikkes. In terms of art style, we retained the original style of Dave the Diver, aiming to provide a visual experience that is different from Nikke.</p><h3><strong>Can you talk about your design ideas for the minigame of this collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Dave's game content is vast and rich, while Nikke's minigames lean toward providing a lightweight experience. Therefore, the challenge in the design process was how to simplify the framework while retaining the essence of the original gameplay, and at the same time, incorporate Nikke's unique elements. We hope the outcome can bring you enjoyment and a different gaming experience from before.</p><h3><strong>What else can Nikke players expect from this collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In the collaborative minigame, you can catch various kinds of fish. Separately, you can enjoy a fishing minigame in the Nikke event field. We believe many of you may find it fun to compare the types of fish you can catch in each minigame.</p><h3><strong>What considerations led to incorporating the new minigame into Nikke?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Although Goddess of Victory: Nikke is based on arcade shooting gameplay, we've always strived to offer various fun elements beyond that, including storylines, character collection and growth, decoration, puzzle games, explorations, and co-op mode. Therefore, we have developed many different types of minigames to provide all Commanders with a richer and more diversified experience.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/26/1-5-year-anniversary-minigame-1719423237550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>How does this collaboration and minigame compare to what you’ve done in the past?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> The minigames we have developed so far have been fast-paced, light-weighted ones (e.g. grilling skewers), while Dave the Diver is actually a larger-scale game with more comprehensive gameplay. In this collaboration, we have integrated the settings of both games so that you can fully enjoy the fun of Dave the Diver in Nikke. Besides, we will strive to cover more diverse and exciting genres in the Nikke minigames.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/02/kv2-1719937718536.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>What are your thoughts on how this collaboration aligns with the summer event's theme?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> While collaborating with Dave the Diver, we will also launch Nikke's summer event — Beauty Full Shot. The event's storyline revolves around the player (commander) and several Nikkes spending their vacation at the seaside. We've prepared a variety of activities that allow you to fully enjoy your summer vacation both at the seaside and underwater. We hope everyone can have a refreshing summer together with Dave the Diver and Nikke.</p><h3><strong>What kind of collaborations do you foresee in the future?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Nikke has already engaged in various forms of collaborations and will continue to do so in the future. Especially, there is an unannounced collaboration plan for this year. Stay tuned for more updates!</p><h3><strong>Dave the Diver recently celebrated its anniversary. Could you tell us about the key activities and significant plans you have for the future of Dave the Diver?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang:</strong> The new story of Dave the Diver will be released in the form of a DLC. We are working hard to develop it and will strive to release relevant information as soon as possible. Additionally, because many players like the characters in Dave, we are internally discussing the possibility of showing more of the stories of each character in the game. Please stay tuned!</p><p>The Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Dave the Diver collaboration will run in July and features a new story and new art for your favorite characters. You can download Nikke on the official site, on the App Store, or Google Play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blumhouse-games-james-wan-m3gan-indie-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blumhouse-games-reveals-first-project-revealed-summer-games-fest">Blumhouse Games revealed its first six projects last month</a>, some familiar names were noticeably absent. Well known in Hollywood for breakout successes like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/23/get-out-review-2">Get Out</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/m3gan-review">M3GAN</a>, Blumhouse Games shied away from leaning on established properties with its new indie label at the jump... But that doesn't mean they're off the table.</p><p>"Certainly we will [incorporate established IP] eventually," Blumhouse Games president Zach Wood tells IGN in an interview following June's reveal. "So much of that I think comes down to the right timing. It's the right idea, it's the right creative partner, it's what else is happening with that IP in the world because we want to do it right, and we know that fans are going to come with their own expectations of what those games should be. We just want to do right by fans and the creators of those film properties. We're just being careful about it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Instead, Blumhouse Games is choosing to approach games as it has approached Hollywood: with a spirit of experimentation. The games it has signed so far run the gamut from well-known names (<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-c-sam-barlow-game">Project C</a>, from Her Story developer Sam Barlow and Infinity Pool director Brandon Cronenberg) to existing releases that Blumhouse Games intends to release on console (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fear-the-spotlight-presented-a-spooky-charming-retro-adventure">Fear the Spotlight</a>). </p><p>Other games include a horrific farming sim called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grave-seasons">Grave Seasons</a>; a twisted folk tale called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/crisol-theater-of-idols">Crisol Theater of Idols</a>; a horror game within a horror game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simulation">The Simulation</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sleep-awake">Sleep Awake</a>, a new game from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/26/spec-ops-the-line-review">Spec Ops: The Line</a> developers Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails' Robin Finck. </p><h2>From horror movies to horror games</h2><p>First announced in 2023, Blumhouse Games is a logical extension of the studio's famous brand of horror. Wood came to Blumhouse Games after a long career spent producing games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/08/sound-shapes-review">Sound Shapes</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-unfinished-swan">The Unfinished Swan</a>, and now leads a team of around seven people. Assisting Wood is some of Blumhouse's Hollywood talent, with prolific horror producer James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring Universe, Insidious) — himself a big gamer — among those consulting on the pitches following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blumhouse-and-atomic-monster-complete-merger">Blumhouse's merger with his production company, Atomic Monster</a>. </p><p>"We meet fairly regularly and show him pitches that we receive, progress on games that are in development and get his feedback. But there's opportunity for more collaborations like Sam and Brandon Cronenberg. Certainly from a writing perspective, there's a stable of writers and directors that are big fans of games," Wood says. </p><p>"I think some of that too is just doing it the right way. It's real collaborations that bring value to elevating a really cool creative work that you couldn't normally achieve otherwise, versus just pairing with someone to put their name on a piece of key art or in a press release. There's an authenticity to it that's really important to us where we think we can really create some really exciting, fruitful collaborations."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The 12 Best Horror Games on PC</h3></div></output><p>The new Blumhouse initiative comes right as Hollywood is becoming more invested in video game adaptations, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-review">Blumhouse's take on Five Nights at Freddy's</a> among those proving to be a hit. In such an environment, Blumhouse Games would seem to be an ideal incubator for new ideas, and Wood acknowledges that Blumhouse is open to turning the games that prove to be especially successful into one of its signature horror movies, though he's not necessarily looking to spin up a new transmedia franchise.</p><p>"I guess what I would say is also just that it is coming from a real organic place with us," Wood says. "We don't think about it as our primary intent to extend game worlds through film and television, but we want to do it when the games resonate with the gaming audience and we think there are interesting stories to tell in those worlds. That's the exciting part."</p><p>Creative lead Louise Blaine adds, "Exploring those worlds in different ways, I think that's what is really exciting about when content does its transmedia thing and goes from game to film. I think people don't automatically want just a version of what they played, that never works. People want to experience those characters or even just the world or a spinoff of that world. I think there's really rich potential there, and I think as long as it's an authentic exploration that is story first, then it's a great thing."</p><p>Is there a world in which Blumhouse Games could work with Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon on publishing a new game?</p><p>"I think that's Scott's world, right? Certainly if Scott would reach out and want to collaborate on a game, I think that'd be exciting, but it's really Scott's world," Wood says.</p><h2>Scaring a decade's worth of people</h2><p>In the short-term and medium term, Wood stresses that Blumhouse Games is just trying to build a sustainable indie horror label in what has been an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">especially fraught year for games</a>. Private Division, which recently shuttered two studios and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">may be on the verge of folding entirely</a>, could be considered a cautionary tale for Blumhouse Games.</p><p>"I think just for us, it's being conservative and being careful about growth and being careful about spend and being very methodical about how we look at our portfolio," Wood says. "As sales of our games increase and there's more desire for more games, then we will then increase the number of games per year that we release."</p><p>That largely precludes any studio acquisitions, though Wood says he's not taking anything off the table. The first potential area of growth, he says, would be releasing more games per year. In the meantime, if any developers want to pitch a M3GAN game of their own, Wood and Blaine say they would be more than happy to listen.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If we scare a decade's worth of people, that would be great</p></div><p>"It's all about that authenticity of that experience," Blaine says. "Because we love those IPs so much, I think it would be about finding the right fit for the right game for the right IP, and putting those together. That's exactly what we want; it's that love and everything to transfer because what people want is that authenticity of a linked product, whether that's a film of a game property or a game of a film property. It works both ways."</p><p>Blumhouse Games' first official release is Fear the Spotlight, which will launch on PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S later this year with additional content. After that, Blumhouse Games is planning to release three more games in 2025, and three more after that in 2026. Beyond that, Blumhouse Games's main ambition is apparently to simply survive — a noble goal whether you're in the games industry or a horror movie.</p><p>"If we scare a decade's worth of people," Blaine finishes, "that would be great."</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Out of the dozens of possible mods in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a>, there are a handful that can be ridden as a mount. However, there are some misconceptions when it comes to the process of acquiring a saddle in Minecraft. In the guide below, you can see all the possible ways to obtain a saddle and how to use it to ride mounts around the world.</p><h2>How to make a Saddle in Minecraft</h2><p>Let's start with the biggest misconception concerning saddles. Unfortunately, it is not possible to craft any kind of saddle in Minecraft. No matter what materials you find and combine together, none of them will make a saddle. This has always been slightly confusing to the player base, as you'd think that a combination of leather and some other materials would be enough to craft the item.</p><p>Now that we know it's impossible to make a saddle in Minecraft, let's go over all the actual ways to obtain one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328319-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.55.05.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328319" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328319-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.55.05.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328319"></a><figcaption>Horses are the most common mounts that can take a saddle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328319-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.55.05.50.png"></figure><h2>How to get a Saddle in Minecraft</h2><p>There are four primary ways to obtain a saddle. All of these methods involve various world activities, some of which are certainly easier than others. However, for the most part, your chances of adding a saddle to your inventory come down to luck. The four ways to obtain a saddle are individually described below:</p><h3>Killing Mobs</h3><p>Perhaps the most straightforward way of obtaining a saddle is through killing specific mobs in Minecraft. While only a couple of mobs have the chance to drop a saddle as loot, there's a decent chance these mobs drop one relatively quickly. The most common mob to drop a saddle are <strong>Ravagers</strong>, as they drop one every time they die. Also, Zombified Piglins riding a Strider in the Nether have a chance to drop the saddle they're currently using as well.</p><h3>Opening Chests</h3><p>Depending on the edition of Minecraft you're playing, you can obtain a saddle through chest loot. The chest locations are the same, but the chances of obtaining a saddle from the chests vary slightly depending on the edition, Java or Bedrock. You can see a full list of chest locations that might contain a saddle for both Java and Bedrock below:</p><p>Chest locations that might hold a saddle:</p><ul><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ancient City</li><li>Bastion Remnant (Hoglin Satble Chest)</li><li>Desert Temple</li><li>End City</li><li>Jungle Temple</li><li>Nether Fortress</li><li>Stronghold (Altar Chest)</li><li>Village (Weaponsmith's house, Savanna house, Tanner's Chest)</li></ul><ul><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ancient City</li><li>Bastion Remnant (Hoglin Stable Chest)</li><li>Desert Temple</li><li>End City</li><li>Jungle Temple</li><li>Nether Fortress</li><li>Stronghold (Altar Chest)</li><li><p>Village (Weaponsmith's house, Savanna house, Tanner's Chest)</p></li></ul><h3>Fishing</h3><p>Arguably, the rarest way to obtain a saddle is through fishing. You have a roughly 1% chance to reel in a saddle as "treasure" when fishing with an unenchanted fishing rod. If you enchant the fishing rod, your odds go up, but not by much.</p><h3>Trading</h3><p>The final way to obtain a saddle in Minecraft is by trading with Master-Level Leatherworker Villagers. There's a 50% chance these Villagers sell a saddle in exchange for six emeralds on Bedrock while there's a 100% chance the Villagers have a saddle for sale for six emeralds. This is the easiest way to obtain a saddle, but only if you've done the legwork required with your Villagers.</p><h2>How to use a Saddle in Minecraft</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328318-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.57.06.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328318" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328318-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.57.06.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328318"></a><figcaption>Saddling a horse in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328318-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.57.06.06.png"></figure><p>Now that you know how to get a saddle, it's time you learned how to use one. For starters, only the following mobs can be saddled and ridden as a mount:</p><ul><li>Pigs</li><li>Camels</li><li>Horses</li><li>Donkeys</li><li>Mules</li><li>Striders</li></ul><p>There are different rules when it comes to applying a saddle and controlling different mounts. For example, you need a carrot on a stick in your inventory to control a pig after it's been saddled while you need to tame mounts like horses and camels before you're able to saddle them. Once a saddle is on a mount, you can climb on and ride them all across the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-goes-gold-nearly-2-months-ahead-of-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few minutes ago, the official Twitter/X Star Wars Outlaws account <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1808531202632044579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the open world game set in George Lucas' beloved science fantasy universe has gone gold well before its planned August 30 launch.</p>
<p>While it's not as much of an advance as Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-goes-gold-nearly-three-months-before-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went gold almost three months ahead of its planned debut</a>, it's still ahead of schedule compared to most recent games, which usually only reach the gold phase a few weeks before the release.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this phrase is used when a product is ready to be delivered and sent for mass disc duplication. Nowadays, some games even skip the retail release at launch, foregoing disc releases entirely in favor of digital-only stores, but the terminology has stuck and developers continue to describe this phase as such.</p>
<p>This also doesn't necessarily mean Star Wars Outlaws developer Ubisoft Massive won't continue working on fixing some potential bugs and issues with a day-one patch. However, it should inspire some confidence that the studio has started the duplication process fairly early because even this build is polished enough.</p>
<p>The game, powered by the studio's impressive Snowdrop engine, delivers seamless transitions between space and planet gameplay (although you won't be able to travel seamlessly between planets, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-freeform-space-travel-between-planets-reputation-system-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by the development team). On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction) for optimal performance and visuals.</p>
<p>Story-wise, Star Wars Outlaws is set between the original trilogy movies The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The setting was proposed by Lucasfilm, who felt this would be the perfect space in which to place an adventure about a scoundrel making her way through the criminal underworld of the galaxy's Outer Rim.
