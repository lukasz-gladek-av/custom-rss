<p>Obsidian Entertainment is officially bringing Avowed to the Sony PlayStation 5 on February 17, 2025. In addition, a new anniversary update to the game introduces several new features for players to explore.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0" rel="nofollow">During the New Game+ Showcase on January 8, 2026,</a> Avowed’s gameplay director, Gabriel Paramo, and lead character artist, Dimitri Berman, touted the amount of additions to the game including new character races coming and the feature of the New Game Plus, allowing players to start a brand new game with all of the previous items they collected through their first playthrough. However, weapons will reset to their default levels, requiring players to level them up again.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-new-features-being-added-to-avowed">Other New Features Being Added to Avowed</h2>



<p>Additionally, a new photo mode was announced, allowing players to take photos of their Envoy. There are also new character presets and numerous creative options for players, which Dimitri and Gabriel say they were unable to complete to their satisfaction in the lead-up to the game’s launch. The game, published by Xbox Game Studios, initially launched in February 2025 on Xbox platforms. However, as more Xbox exclusive games begin coming to New platforms with Microsoft’s “Everything is an Xbox” campaign in full swing, PlayStation players are now getting the chance to experience the world of the Living Lands in the Pillars of Eternity universe.</p>

<p>The Obsidian representatives stated Avowed would be available for pre-order on January 8, but as of this Friday, the PlayStation Store has not made the landing page accessible. Insider Gaming will report when PlayStation officially makes the game available for pre-order.</p>

              <p><em>Avowed</em> was quietly <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">one of 2025’s best RPGs</a>. In fact, it even made <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161">best games of the year list</a>. But it was also one of the few remaining Microsoft games that was still exclusive to Xbox Series X/S. That changes next month. Obsidian Entertainment confirmed the <em>Skyrim</em>-like will hit PlayStation 5 on February 17 alongside a big anniversary update across all platforms.</p> <p>Despite bringing <em>Forza Horizon</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5 in 2025, <em>Avowed</em> remained an unusual island of exclusivity amid Microsoft’s new multiplatform push. It’ll now join Obsidian Entertainment’s other 2025 RPG, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, on Sony’s platform where millions more players will get a chance to try it. Here’s the developer interview from the New Game+ Showcase where the port was announced:</p>

  <p>Obsidian also revealed what the game’s next big update will entail. In addition to a photo mode and new game plus mode, players will also get access to new character races, including dwarves, and an additional weapon type. New game plus mode, meanwhile, will reset players’ level back to one but let them keep all of their gear from the previous playthrough as well as explore new enemy modifiers. The new races were the real heavy lift, however.</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="2 minutes, 15 seconds games had. It's a lot of work and a">“It’s a lot of work and a difficult thing to really nail down, especially in <em>Avowed</em> with its parkour systems and its combat mechanics and all the weapon types and stuff like that in the game,” Dimitri Berman said in the interview. “Our different races are different sizes, they’re different shapes, they’re a very unique game experience when you play as each one of them in a first-person game specifically. So it was something new to wrangle for <em>Avowed</em>.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="2 minutes, 15 seconds games had. It's a lot of work and a">While the game plays like <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, it takes place in the fantasy universe from the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> games. The first of those is also currently getting a major update to add a turn-based mode. We’ll see if Obsidian plans to make an eventual <em>Pillars 3</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">that merges the best parts of both series</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Gameplay Overview trailer highlights features of the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Among other highlights, it was confirmed that the game will feature the most playable characters ever available in a Mario Tennis game, including the debut of Baby WaLuigi.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever was first announced during the September Nintendo Direct, in a segment focused on the 40th anniversary of the Super Mario Bros. franchise. In the new trailer released on January 8, 2026, there was a more detailed breakdown of the new features, including a look at the full roster, with debuts of Goomba, Baby WaLuigi, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-mario-party-tennis-fever-features">More Mario Party Tennis Fever Features</h2>



<p>In addition to the extensive roster, the game features the new Fever Rackets. There will be over 30 rackets, each with its own ability. For example, the Shadow Racket creates a duplicate of the character you’re using to have your opponent see double. There is also a range of new modes. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/get-ready-for-tennis-with-a-twist-in-the-new-mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer/">Nintendo describes</a> the Mix It Up mode as a way to play matches with unique twists. For example, Ring Shot Mode, where players try to hit balls through rings to score points. Also, there’s Forest Court Match, where feeding Piranha Plants a stream of tennis balls expands the court.</p>



<p>There’s also the previously announced Adventure Mode, which features Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, and WaLuigi being transformed into babies by monsters. With the help of Donkey Kong, who is acting as a babysitter, they must overcome challenges to return to normal.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-fans-are-trying-to-solve-a-three-year-old-arg-that-may-give-clues-to-a-beloved-characters-fate</link>
            <guid>1401091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, fellow Undertale and Deltarune fan. Did you know there was a Deltarune ARG going on? Did you know it's technically been going on for three years now? Yeah, neither did I!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first learned about the Deltarune ARG (Alternate Reality Game) earlier this week, when a video about it surfaced in my YouTube recommendations. I started out just mildly curious, but I quickly fell down a rabbit hole that had me digging through massive spreadsheets, scouring Reddit threads, and pouring over weird corners of the official Deltarune website. And now, I'm going to infect you with it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to fully unpack the entire ARG in a way that covers every little bit of what's happened and what it could mean, I would have to spoil all four chapters of Deltarune, probably some bits of Undertale, and dive into a deep, deep, <em>deep </em>pit of Deltarune fan theories. So I'm going to try to keep the explanation as high level as is possible while still making sense. But as a warning ahead of time: <strong>this will contain spoilers for Chapters 1 and 2 of Deltarune, especially the "Weird Route", and some very light allusions to characters and events in Chapters 3 and 4. Read on at your own risk:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Deltarune ARG actually began in September 2022, during an event called the <a href="https://deltarune.com/sweepstakes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spamton Sweepstakes</a> celebrating Undertale's seventh anniversary, which raised money for the charity Child's Play. Most of the event was fun, silly, and non-ARG-related, themed around the eccentric Chapter 2 character Spamton and including a lot of fun new merchandise courtesy of Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, the ever-vigilant Deltarune community stumbled upon some unusual hidden content within the pages on the Deltarune website dedicated to the sweepstakes. At the time, most of it consisted of fun Easter Eggs, and I don't want to get into it all, but it was the first major sign that something was up. It wasn't until May of 2025 (two and a half years later) that things really kicked off. Fans suddenly noticed that there were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5RKswkbmF_Jp7BaCuJ75ei5Xieu_yPMcMP5gEcaonQ/mobilebasic#h.iky9p49ddxoo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more secrets</a> on the Deltarune website dedicated to the sweepstakes. There were a number of new <a href="https://deltarune.com/chapter5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden pages</a>, all of which made reference to the game's deeply eerie and hidden "Weird Route", but the one that matters most to the ARG was <a href="https://deltarune.com/chapter4/thankyou/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deltarune.com/chapter4/thankyou</a>. At the time, the website consisted of two very small blanks where users could input text, and a blank button that allowed them to submit it. There were no clues as to what needed to go into the blanks, save for a single question:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"How long did it take her to smile?"</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune fans very quickly guessed that the "her" being referenced was Noelle, a beloved character and the childhood best friend of Deltarune protagonist Kris. She's also the focal point of the aforementioned Weird Route, in which the player (a separate character from Kris) manipulates Noelle into doing something terrible in the interest of becoming stronger. Fans also figured out that the first blank was looking for an email address, with the second blank being for the actual "answer" to the question. Unfortunately, the form was only open for a day, before being replaced with text that just said "Thank You." Those who had submitted their email in the form began receiving effectively a confirmation email that just contained "You answered [THEIR ANSWER]." No further explanation. Nothing! For months!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, when all this happened, Chapters 3 and 4 weren't out yet. Those released earlier this year, and with them, more Weird Route content and a couple of horrifying, hidden scenes focused on Noelle in particular. Then two weeks ago, those who had received the confirmation email the first time received a new email that just said, "Second chance," and found that the form had been reopened. The community efforts were more coordinated this time, with people experimenting with different combinations of time amounts in days, seconds, years, as well as other textual responses they felt made sense. A number of community members tried to document submissions to avoid duplications, though given the short notice and short time period the form was open, this was once again difficult to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The form closed again, and once again, participants received emails. But this time, they were different. Individuals were getting one of a collection of different responses that seemed to be based on what they submitted. For instance, those who said "1 Day" received back "Then, 'The next day you'll see her smile.'" People who inputted very small numbers, such as 4 seconds, got back, "So, 'she never stopped smiling'". There are a bunch of other creepy answers, like "Do you think that means she still can?" and "Then, 'It was the first time she ever smiled in her life.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many emails ended with another sentence: "Move forward with this answer," seemingly indicating the submission was on the right track.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/screenshot-2026-01-08-144646-1767905239635.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from FlamingLily's spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was two weeks ago, and the form has been closed ever since. There's no indication of whether anyone got the right answer, what the next step is, or if the form will ever open up again. In preparation for a third attempt, a number of content creators have been rallying fans into communities to track what answers garnered what responses, and piece those responses together to try and figure out a "correct" answer if the form reopens. There are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple massive spreadsheets</a> out there cataloging confirmed responses, as well as others assigning different answers to each participant ahead of time, so no one wastes an answer on a duplicate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/screenshot-2026-01-08-144601-1767905276669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from Flaming Lily's spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does it all mean? We're...not exactly sure. The general consensus is that all this has something to do with where Chapter 4's "Weird Route" leaves Noelle, and speculation about what's to come in Chapter 5 at the "festival" event we know is going to take place during it. But even though that's the most likely context, it's a pretty unusual one: the Weird Route is extremely hard to figure out without assistance from the internet, and its dark consequences make it unlikely that the vast majority of players would ever see it or understand what any of this is about. If this ARG is going to reveal some deep lore, or even impact the game somehow, it's likely that very few people will understand or even care about the result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be by design, though. Critically, the second time the form opened, only people who participated and received feedback from it the first time were able to use it again. If you're just learning about this (as I am), you may be entirely too late to participate at all. It's also possible there's no progress on whatever this is for months, even years. We've already waited along time just for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm really just scratching the surface here, and probably sound like I'm completely crazy. If you've played Deltarune and didn't know about any of this, you probably had a pleasant time with a cool, well-written RPG with funny, lovable characters, and left it at that. That's an extremely normal way to enjoy this game, and probably will be most people's experience! But since Deltarune's Chapter 1 release, there's been a whole ecosystem of secrets, fan theories, and conspiracies surrounding the question of what this game actually <em>is, </em>how it relates to Undertale, and what the implications of its hidden, darker narrative might be for the game's lighter side. It's complex, weird, and fun as hell to dig into, and we probably won't know the full scope of it for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is all to say, good luck to the secret hunters, and I'm genuinely sorry I can't help.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios has outlined its plan to deal with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> cheaters after they became a hot topic in the community earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheaters are a concern for nearly all multiplayer games, but they’ve become an especially controversial subject amongst players recently. Reports of cheaters seem to be increasing in recent weeks, as players share clips and stories of others shooting them through walls and from unreachable areas. The conversation then reached a boiling point when popular streamers like <a href="https://x.com/Ninja/status/2008707896918372595?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ninja</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nadeshot</u></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/2008969384073810136?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shroud</u></a> began publicly voicing their concerns.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"This might be my last day playing for a very long time...

The note comes with an acknowledgement of the discussion surrounding cheaters in the community, promising that the studio is “taking this issue very seriously” as it awaits further feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters,” Embark said. “This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the ‘out of map’ glitch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Embark’s efforts will be enough to deter the most problematic Arc Raiders offenders, but it’s at least a sign the studio will take action through January. The message also comes with a promise specifically for streamers, saying the team is “introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for your valuable feedback and for helping us make ARC Raiders a fair and fun experience for everyone,” the message concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025.

			<p>2025 saw the return of one of the biggest strategy franchises in the genre, a spiritual successor to a series that fans are dying to see make a comeback, and a beloved game get its long-awaited remake. There was plenty to fill our pick of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2025</a>, and if everything on our list below makes it out before the end of 2026, putting together 2026's list of the best strategy games and best simulation games shouldn't be an issue either.</p>

<h2 id="h-star-wars-zero-company-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars Zero Company (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Star-Wars-Zero-Company-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bit Reactor</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you wanted to give someone the elevator pitch for Star Wars: Zero Company, telling them 'It's XCOM but make it Star Wars,' would be enough to get any strategy game player with a mild love for Star Wars through the door.</p>



<p>We can't be sure if it'll be that exact of a match-up whenever Star Wars: Zero Company does arrive on PC and current-gen consoles sometime in 2026, but it has the precedent to be. Bit Reactor was founded by former XCOM developers, with the studio led by Greg Foerstch, former art director at Firaxis on XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns. With so much XCOM blood in the studio, it's exciting to think of the kind of gameplay and storytelling we'll get, all set within the Star Wars universe. Hopefully, it makes its proposed 2026 window, and we're playing it before the end of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ace-Combat-8-Wings-of-Theve.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">One of the bigger announcements of The Game Awards,</a> Bandai Namco's Ace Combat series is returning with Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve. It's not necessarily a jet flying simulator, but its simulation-style approach is what has it in our picks for what we're looking forward to from simulation games this year.</p>



<p>It's the first mainline entry in the series in seven years, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">2019's Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-7-3-million-copies-sequel-in-development/">gone on to sell over 3 million copies since then</a>. It may not be the best-selling series in Bandai Namco's portfolio, but there's a clear hunger for more Ace Combat and millions of players who will happily buy this new entry when it arrives. Hopefully, we'll know more about the game and its release soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-total-war-warhammer-40-000-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Total-War-Warhammer-40K.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Total War series is hitting a couple of 'firsts' with the coming release of Total War: Warhammer 40,000. It'll be the first time the Total War series makes the trip to the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, but perhaps more importantly for the series, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will be the first time the Total War series makes its way to consoles, as it is also set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with the help of David Harbour from Stranger Things, the coming game will feature the Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum as its four factions, and while it doesn't have an official release window yet, the announcement did include gameplay footage which hopefully means its far enough along that we could see it arrive in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-tbc-2026-pc">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Warhammer-40K-Dawn-of-War-IV.png"></a><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV. Image credit: Deep Silver</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A second appearance from the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, though this time it's coming from its own series of RTS games instead of a different franchise making its first foray into the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The long-awaited Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV was shown off multiple times in 2025, including with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-stunning-in-engine-trailer/">an incredible-looking in-engine gameplay trailer</a> that made the game look like it was ready for release very soon.</p>



<p>It doesn't have an official release date or release window yet, but we'll hopefully be hearing more about it soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-nova-roma-march-26-2026-pc">Nova Roma (March 26, 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nova-Roma.png"></a><figcaption><em>Nova Roma. Image credit: Lion Shield</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last on our main picks is Nova Roma, a new upcoming title from developer Lion Shield and publisher Hooded Horse, the latter of whom has made a name for themselves as having a keen eye for upcoming strategy titles. </p>



<p>This city builder asks you to appease the Roman gods and create a successful and thriving Ancient Roman empire, and if you feel like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> didn't scratch the Ancient Roman itch you have, then Nova Roma could be the game to do it. </p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>Of course, we can't have every upcoming game in our main picks, but the following games are still worth paying attention to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[César-Winning Composer Amine Bouhafa Used an “Alien Instrument” To Help Capture the Frozen World of DON’T NOD’s Aphelion]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cesar-winning-composer-amine-bouhafa-used-an-alien-instrument-to-help-capture-the-frozen-world-of-dont-nods-aphelion/</link>
            <guid>1401061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>DON'T NOD has unveiled a new trailer for its upcoming game, <strong>Aphelion</strong>, at today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> which focused on the game's music and featured an interview with its award-winning composer, Amine Bouhafa.</p>



<p>You may have already heard Bouhafa's work in the 2021 short film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5030456/?ref_=fn_t_1">The Summit of the Gods</a> or in 2025's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28326501/">The Little Sister</a>, though this is the first time the <strong>César-winning</strong> composer is working on a video game. "<em>This is my first time working on a video game, and I loved the way that [the Aphelion team] thought about the music and about the game. I'm enjoying the experience</em>," Bouhafa said in a press release.</p>



<p>Bouhafa narrates the trailer while gameplay from Aphelion is shown, as he describes how he approached writing the score for his first video game and how he used what he described as an "<em>alien instrument</em>" called a Cristal Baschet to capture the cold and frozen world of the game. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Aphelion | A Musical Journey - Amine Bouhafa" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkTMEg1x6Qc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>It is an instrument that had been invented by the Baschet brothers in the mid-20th century. For me, it looks like an alien instrument. When you see it, you cannot even predict that it's a musical instrument</em>," Bouhafa says. Playing the Cristal Baschet involves dipping your hands in water and then running them along several crystal batons to create its sound. For Bouhafa, it was the perfect element to "<em>convey the frozen identity of the score</em>."</p>



<p>Bouhafa also talks about using the grand organ at the Saint-Eustache Church in Paris, which helped convey the bigger, grander, and sacred moments in Aphelion's narrative. It's all together an interesting behind-the-scenes look at how a major aspect of Aphelion is coming together. </p>



<p>DON'T NOD has suffered a string of commercial misses lately, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">last year's Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage missing expectations</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant both underperforming before that</a>. The studio does have a new game in the works with Netflix on top of Aphelion, which could prove fruitful, as it is based on "<em>a major IP</em>" within Netflix, but it'll be some time before that materializes into a full release - if Netflix even lets it get that far, since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">its willing involvement in video games seems iffy</a>, at best.</p>



<p>Aphelion is currently set to arrive sometime in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-union-complaint-switch-2-2000658263</link>
            <guid>1401055</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-christmas-holiday-sales-down-europe-uk-us-nintendo-2000658223">Nintendo of America</a> is once again facing labor complaints from one or more of its workers. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-teksystems-labor-complaints"><em>Game File</em> reports</a> that new charges accuse the Switch 2 manufacturer of violating sections of the National Labor Relations Act dealing with worker organizing and related union activities. These come just a few years after the company settled <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-splatoon-3-mario-strikers-working-conditions-u-1848918777">a previous labor charge</a> with a former tester for $26,000.</p> <p>The charges were filed on December 17 and January 6 against both Nintendo and tech contracting services firm Teksystems. They both list the following alleged violations of the NLRA: “8(a)(4) Discharge (including Layoff and Refusal to Hire)” and “8(a)(1) Concerted Activities (Retaliation, Discharge, Discipline).” Here’s an explanation of section 8(a)(1) in more detail from <em>Game File</em>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>8(a)(1) bars employers from interfering with or restraining employees from their right to self-organize, “to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.”</p></blockquote> <p>While it’s unclear exactly what the nature of this particular labor dispute is over, it’s not the first time a Nintendo worker has taken the company to task over its labor practices with the NLRB. MacKenzie Clifton, who tested <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> and other games at the company’s North American Headquarters, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/29/nintendo-tester-union-busting-whistleblower">told <em>Game File</em></a> in 2022 they believed their contract was cut short for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-smash-bros-ultimate-union-busting-1849652308">mentioning unionization</a> to ex-President Doug Bowser during an online meeting.</p>

 <p>Nintendo ultimately settled that case for damages and back-pay that amounted to $26,000, but it led many then-current and former contractors at the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-america-switch-employee-treatment-unionize-nlr-1848828975">to speak out about feeling underpaid and exploited</a>. The company has since shifted some of its contractors to full-time roles while cutting others. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> last fall that there were concerns among some at the company that Nintendo would be outsourcing more of its customer service work to overseas partners ahead of the Switch 2 holiday season.</p>

A physical edition of the game will also be distributed by <a title="Companies > Maximum Entertainment [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/maximum-entertainment">Maximum Entertainment</a> across North America, Europe, and Australia. <span id="more-1018338"></span></p><p>“This is my first time working on a video game, and I loved the way that [the <em>Aphelion</em> team] thought about the music and about the game,” Bouhafa said in a press release. “I’m enjoying the experience.”</p><p>DON’T NOD creative director Florent Guillaume added, “It has been a real pleasure to collaborate with Amine on Aphelion. We discovered his work through his composition for The Summit of the Gods and were immediately captivated by his talent for portraying the intimacy of characters caught up in a grand, epic adventure. Amine is a person with great emotional intelligence and sincere humanity. I hope that players will feel that connection and will be moved by their experience.”</p><p>Here are the latest details, via DON’T NOD:</p><blockquote><p>Amine Bouhafa is a Cesar award-winning French-Tunisian composer known for his scores on <em>Timbuktu</em> (2015), <em>The Summit of the Gods</em> (2021), and <em>The Little Sister</em> (2025). </p><p>Players will be able to experience Bouhafa’s unique blend of epic and intimate as it gives life to planet Persephone and supports Ariane and Thomas’s journeys in the game. His work easily and beautifully conveys the atmosphere and mood of the planet, the tension of the Nemesis, and the emotions between the characters. The video explores the ways in which Amine uses instruments such as the pipe organ and the unique cristal baschet in order to reflect the sacred feeling of the adventure, and to bring to life the frozen identity of Persephone</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-armored-core-vital-shell-mechs-2000658252</link>
            <guid>1401031</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Have you ever wondered what might happen if you put </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span> and </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">Vampire Survivors</a></span></i><span> into opposite ends of the teleporter from </span><i><span>The Fly</span></i><span> and flipped the switch? The resulting mash-up would probably look a lot like </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span>, a game by solo developer Marvin Wizard released to Steam on January 8.</span></p> <p><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span>, fortunately, is less a monstrous example of scientific hubris and more a competent, top-down arena shooter that combines fantasy mechs with automatic battling mechanics and adds an aesthetic splash of PlayStation 1 visuals and ambient jungle music for good vibes. I spent a few rounds running the game through its paces after noticing its launch this morning and, folks, it’s pretty dang fun.</span></p>

  <p><span>If you’ve played </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors</span></i><span>, you should mostly know what to expect here. </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> places players in control of a giant robot and tasks them with destroying everything in their wake. What this looks like in practice is kiting waves of enemy hordes around a nondescript battlefield, persisting long enough to level up, and building an ever-improving kit of weaponry and upgrades for tackling the challenges ahead.</span></p>

 <p><span>As fun as </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> is gameplay-wise, it really excels in presentation. The level-up screen looks like something out of early installments of </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span>, and the clean 3D graphics make it easy to distinguish friend from foe during raucous battles. Marvin Wizard also developed the game</span> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3741860/view/506206686159048296"><span>with a “console-first approach” from the beginning</span></a><span>, which means the menus are snappy and easy to navigate via controller. I first tried playing </span><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> with mouse and keyboard but quickly switched to my trusty DualSense and haven’t looked back.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658254">MarvinWizard</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Vital Shell</span></i><span> is now available on Steam for $4.79 (the price goes up to $5.99 after January 21), alongside</span> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928280/Vital_Shell_Demo_Disc/"><span>a demo-disc-style preview</span></a><span> if you want to try before you buy. It’s a solo affair at the moment, but Marvin Wizard is exploring the addition of co-op in a future update.</span></p>

                <p>Near the end of October 2025, Rockstar fired over thirty devs in the United Kingdom and Canada over what it called "gross misconduct." The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">accused Rockstar of union busting</a> for laying off workers who were organizing with the union. Both sides have held firm since the initial accusations, and now the battle has gone to court in the UK.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fired-rockstar-games-developers-fight-for-payroll-relief-at-employment-tribunal-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Rockstar and the IWGB went before the court earlier this week, where the latter requested that the fired workers be given "interim relief" while the legal drama plays out. If granted, that would place the affected workers back on Rockstar's payroll and allow some to keep their visas that were reliant on their jobs. The court will reportedly decide on the matter before the end of the week.</p><p>The IWGB pledged to continue fighting for the workers regardless of the court's decision, while Rockstar reiterated its position that the workers broke the company's policy.</p><p>"We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information, including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel," a Rockstar spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies. This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed."</p><p>There is some question as to whether the alleged break of confidentiality had anything to do with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. A report from November 2025 noted that the employees in question shared details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar's rule changes for Slack</a>, which eliminated most of the personal and non-work channels. That story also stated that Rockstar's internal security is so tight that employees can't even check their work emails unless they are in the office.</p><p>This case may boil down to whether Rockstar can prove that the employees shared sensitive details that violated their terms of employment. The case has drawn a considerable amount of attention worldwide. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and MP Chris Murray</a> have both pledged to look into it, but the legal battle may take a long time to play out.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has revealed its first set of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-joy-con-2-light-purple-light-green-preorder-roundup/1100-6537276/" data-ref-id="1100-6537276">new Joy-Con controllers</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">pretty expensive</a> right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.</p><p>Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as "Light Green." Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4632816-switch2newjoycons.png" data-ref-id="1300-4632816" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4632816-switch2newjoycons.png" data-ref-id="1300-4632816"></a><figcaption>The new Switch 2 Joy-Cons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4632816-switch2newjoycons.png"></figure><p>However, the problem with these new Joy-Cons is that, for the most part, you won't actually <em>see</em> these colors. When using your Switch 2 in handheld mode or with the Joy-Con grip, the strips of color on the inner portion of the controllers are entirely hidden. So while these colors might be pretty, it's a bit disappointing that they are essentially relegated to two small rings around the thumbsticks.</p><p>So sure, if you are just looking to pick up a second pair of Joy-Cons simply to have a second pair of Joy-Cons you might as well grab these; there's at least a <em>small </em>difference between them and the standard red and blue controllers that come with the console. That said, it's just a bummer that they lack the same level of whimsy, creativity, and variation as the original Switch's Joy-Cons.</p><p>The good news is you can (kinda) remedy this issue so long as you're willing to spend an extra $20. Shortly after the Joy-Cons were revealed, gaming accessories company Dbrand announced it had already created a <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/nintendo-switch-2-skins#/customizer/details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Joy-Con skin</a> that perfectly matches the new colorway. It's not an official fix, sure, but to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mbwuee3lgt2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quote the brand</a>, it "does what Nintendon't."</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/sega-persona-3-reload-soundtrack-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1400995</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A couple years ago, the <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> soundtrack <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OkBuddyPersona/comments/1aoluhb/comment/kq0edbv/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>was uploaded to Spotify</u></a>. The issue? Developer Atlus hadn't released the album digitally. That album, and <em>Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey</em>'s soundtrack, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1avlnqj/why_the_heck_did_they_take_the_reloaded_ost_off/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>were uploaded by a random guy and quickly removed</u></a>—likely from a DMCA request—in 2024. Now, Sega is suing over it.</p><p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/978185320/Sega-suing-over-unauthorized-music-uploads?ref=aftermath.site"><u>In a lawsuit filed Thursday in Florida</u></a>, Sega said it discovered in March 2024 that a person with the username Ziodyne (<a href="https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Ziodyne?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a reference to a skill in Shin Megami Tensei</u></a>) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OkBuddyPersona/comments/1b4zbvx/fatlus_hit_ziodyne_with_demonic_decree/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>uploaded the two soundtracks</u></a> to different music platforms, like Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon. That person used a music distribution service called DistroKid to get the soundtracks on the platforms, offering them for sale and streaming. Sega says the person "received significant revenue and profits from the unauthorized sales," and that the person used the <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> logo to "deceive or mislead consumers concerning the source of the sound recordings."</p><p>DistroKid is a distribution service that advertises itself as an easy way to get music on all different platforms—Instagram, Spotify, Amazon, Tidal, and more. It charges a yearly fee, collects payments from streaming and sales, then pays out the artist. The company has been <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/distrokid-faces-potential-class-action-lawsuit-over-how-it-handles-takedown-requests/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sued at least nine times for how it handles DMCA takedown requests</u></a>, failing to pay out artists, and other reasons. Many of these cases are pendings, but a few have been dismissed.</p><p>Sega wasn't offering these soundtracks digitally yet, but people were looking for them. People immediately noticed them, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OkBuddyPersona/comments/1aoluhb/comment/kq0edbv/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to several different Reddit posts</u></a>, which showed the <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> soundtrack as having more than 26,000 monthly listens on Spotify. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OkBuddyPersona/comments/1bpxur5/ziodyne_has_burning_mans_soul_as_a_song_on/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>On Reddit</u></a>, another screenshot of Ziodyne's page showed more than 134,000 monthly listens, including the popular <em>Burning Men's Soul</em> from the <em>Persona Trinity Soul</em> anime. Sega says in its lawsuit that it subpoenaed Apple, Spotify, and DistroKid to determine Ziodyne’s identity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1boozwb/first_part_of_the_persona_3_reload_ost_is_now/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Commenters on Reddit</u></a> called Ziodyne an "unsung hero" for getting the music out there: "They reuploaded it like 3 times despite it getting taken down each time what a legend," one person wrote. <a href="https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Men%27s_Soul?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ziodyne appears to have been beloved by the Reddit community</u></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OkBuddyPersona/comments/1bhcwy5/they_took_my_baby_boy_ziodyne_again/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>for his perseverance</u></a> in uploading Atlus' music, which was often otherwise hard to find online.</p><p>"Defendant has taken advantage of a set of circumstances, including the anonymity and mass reach afforded by the Internet and social media, coupled with the cover afforded by international borders, to violate Sega’s intellectual property rights with impunity," Sega's lawyers wrote in the complaint.</p><p>Sega is looking for "at least $60,000" in monetary damages, according to the complaint. The counts listed in the complaint include copyright infringement, trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition.</p><p>Since the unauthorized version was removed, Sega and Atlus have uploaded their own digital version of the <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> soundtrack to music platforms. <em>Strange Journey</em>'s soundtrack doesn't appear to be available digitally.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Sega of America and Ziodyne for comment.</p>

<p>That's according to a report from <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/418652">GameBiz</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/trails-developer-nihon-falcom-to-shift-focus-on-increasing-number-of-released-titles-per-year-and-publishing-more-switch-2-ports-six-unannounced-titles-currently-in-development/">Automaton Media</a>), where the creator of the <strong>Ys</strong> and <strong>Trails</strong> series has also teased that its currently working on a brand new Nintendo Switch 2 port of one of their existing titles.

<p>Sales for the company increased by 3.5% year on year, which works out to around $16.7 million USD, in 2025. Operating profit is up 8.1%, while net profit has increased by 6.0%. These successes include the international launches for titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails through Daybreak II</a>, the worldwide release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a>, and the Japanese release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a>.</p>
<p>Another big goal for the company is to broaden the company's reach, and while the Switch 2 will certainly help with that, it's also looking to do that with more multiplatform releases and multi-language support — for the latter, both Ys X: Proud Nordics' international release and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</a> will include English, French, German, and Spanish subtitles.</p>
<p>While Falcom has been pretty busy in recent years, much of its focus has been on ports, which it says "had a limited impact on business performance."</p>

<p>Now the company aims to release two new titles per year over the next three years, and it's currently working on six unannounced titles; two of these are new ports (including the Switch 2 one), and three are brand new games, which includes a new <strong>Trails</strong>, a new <strong>Ys</strong>, and a new <strong>Tokyo Xanadu</strong> game.</p>
<p>Yes, 2025 was a particularly big year for the legendary Japanese developer, 2026 doesn't look to be any slower. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> launches just next week (and psst, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">it's pretty darn good on Switch 2</a>), and we have Ys X: Proud Nordics' international release on 20th February.</p>
<p>Then, later in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_revelations_in_celceta">Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</a> launches in English, with Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter launching in the Fall. <em>Phew</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The creator of the most popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> setting has announced a new project. Ed Greenwood, the creator of the Forgotten Realms, has announced Realmsbound, a series of books designed to flesh out the iconic setting further.</p><p>According to its official <a href="https://mythmakers.com/realmsbound/dalelands" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">web page</a>, Realmsbound is a project intended to bring new lore, stories, and adventures to the land of the Forgotten Realms. These books will be available on DMs Guild both as PDFs and in physical copies through print-on-demand.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The books in question will flesh out certain locations in the setting and highlight areas that have never been seen before. As the page itself states, this is not a journey into uncharted lands, but a deepening of what was always there, waiting to be found.</p><p>This is an admirable project given the current state of the Forgotten Realms in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Despite decades of supplements, &nbsp;prewritten adventure modules like <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em>, award-winning video games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and one <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">feature film</a>, the worldbuilding and lore are centered on one small part: the Sword Coast. Even the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">2024 supplements</a> stay within this region of the land of Faerun.</p><p>This is where the Realmsbound project comes in. The first region getting the long-awaited glow-up is the Dalelands. The first book, <em>Guide to the Dalelands</em>, expands upon the material in the <em>Adventures in Faerun</em> book, adding more texture and history to the region. This will include detailed maps of regions like Cormanthor, as well as information on local economies, secretive factions, and echoes of long-lost power.</p><p>The second supplement, included in this book, is a Player's Guide meant to help ground players in the setting. The three remaining supplements focus on other aspects of play. <em>Inn Sites of the Dalelands</em> focuses on social encounters, local holidays and regional events, fleshed out NPCs and inns, and casual mini-games. <em>Delves of the Dalelands</em> focuses on areas of interest full of legendary danger.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Lastly, <em>Adventures in the Dalelands</em> is an anthology book. It will contain several prewritten adventures up to level 12. All of these books will be released over the course of a year. Guide to the Dalelands will release in Q1 2026, Inn Sites releases in Q2 2026, Delves releases in Q3 2026, and Adventures will release in Q4 2026.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-realmsbound-forgotten-realms-2026/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a>, Greenwood spoke more about the Realmsbound project. He states that, much like the original creation of the Forgotten Realms, the project is a collaborative effort. The team includes creative director Eric Menge, who produced the Moonshae campaign for Adventurer's League, and senior designer Savannah Houston McIntyre (<em>City of Greyhawk</em>).</p><p>Ed Greenwood returning to expand on a setting he helped create isn't unheard of for a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> setting. The creator of Eberron, Keith Baker, has published multiple supplements as well on DMs Guild for the game's latest edition. His latest book, <em>Frontiers of Eberron: Quickstone</em>, expands upon the latest 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/eberron-forge-of-artificer-review-minor-tweaks-overall-but-fun-new-subclass" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Forge of the Artificer</em></a> supplement, adding new player options and more history to the setting's Western Frontier.</p><p>At the time of writing, it is unclear how much the Realmsbound supplements will be sold for. It can be speculated that, based on the current prices of theEberron books, they may be sold for around $35 for PDFs and $75 for physical copies.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-sequel-nazis-trump-ice-machinegames-2000658228</link>
            <guid>1400974</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The news that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758"><i><span>Wolfenstein 3</span></i></a><span> is in the works is music to my ears. I’ve long been a fan of Sweden-based MachineGames’ take on </span><i><span>Wolfenstein</span></i><span>, which transforms B.J. Blazkowicz’s one-man war on occult-powered Nazis into a grisly and moving narrative about the strength of family and communities while finding oneself amidst endless conflict. </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 2</span></i><span> showed the importance of resisting the narrative that fascism can and will win. If I have one concrete hope for a potential sequel, it’s that it doesn’t ease up on the gas.</span></p> <p><span>The first of these games, </span><i><span>Wolfenstein: The New Order</span></i><span> is</span><span> really good, as is its prequel, <em>The Old Blood</em>. Their shooting chops have always been up to snuff and their unflinching narratives were a breath of fresh air at a time when FPS fare was beginning to feel a little same-y. They had a stylish verve that was becoming all-too uncommon and paired B.J. with the likes of alt-history takes on Jimi Hendrix and Nikola Tesla. Besides that, it was also refreshingly novel to play an FPS about Nazis at a time where it seemed like most of the genre was ditching the past in favor of modern and future conflicts. It was 2014, and we couldn’t have known what was to come.</span></p> <p><i><span>Wolfenstein: The New Colossu</span></i><span>s was an entirely different story. Arriving in the fall of 2017, </span><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span> struck like lightning. Its unveiling and marketing beats reveled in the joy of ripping fascists to shreds, while </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/8-years-after-wolfenstein-2-vowed-to-make-america-nazi-free-again-multiple-reports-suggest-wolfenstein-3-is-finally-in-development/"><span>leaning into the dystopic headlines</span></a><span> Americans increasingly became inundated with. It adopted the “punch Nazis now, ask questions later” ideology that emerged amid Donald Trump’s first presidency and the rise of the alt-right. More specifically, it leaned into that time that Richard Spencer–a Neo-Nazi and early figurehead of the alt-right movement–got </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFh08JEKDYk"><span>decked</span></a><span> by an unknown assailant on camera.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the time, many criticized publisher Bethesda’s decision to appropriate some of this language and rhetoric throughout </span><i><span>The New Colossus’</span></i><span> marketing cycle. Fans of the games and companies involved openly protested against the game on social media, and even threatened to boycott it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During an interview with </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolfenstein/comments/7ap3n8/hey_bethseda_youre_game_is_making_people_mad/"><i><span>Vice News</span></i></a><span> which centered on this outrage, Bethesda’s then-director of PR, Pete Hines, told the outlet, “Unless you’re a Nazi, there should be nobody who’s opposed to the idea of being against Nazis.” When told that the game’s aggressive marketing tone might be poking the hornet’s nest, Hines even doubled down, saying, “Maybe a little bit, but the hornet’s nest is full of Nazis so…fuck those guys. I’ll poke a Nazi hornet’s nest.”</span></p>  <p><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span>‘ narrative was as brazen as its marketing campaign and bold in a way few games have managed since, focusing on a Nazi-occupied America and how B.J. and his allies, the Kreisau Circle, begin fomenting rebellion at home. It is filled with sights that are still hard to shake, like KKK members in full Klan garb chumming it up with Nazi shocktroopers on the streets of Roswell, New Mexico. And it is filled with characters and pulse-pounding dialogue exchanges that interrogate whether America has ever really been the virtuous home of freedom its most patriotic defendants claim it to be. After all, America under Nazi rule in <em>The New Colossus </em>looks a lot like America always has</span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe the root of evil wasn’t abroad all along. Maybe it’s been in us the whole time. And maybe we never really stamped it out because the blood and cruelty which it produces has always greased the wheels of this </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"><span>damnable, infernal machine</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And yet B.J. and his allies fight like hell to dismantle it. They take on impossible odds, which manifest in </span><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span>‘ difficulty spikes and often brutal gauntlets and level design. B.J. himself even takes a detour into his past and confronts the earliest source of evil in his life: his racist, abusive father, Rip. And you know what he does? He exorcizes his demons. It is cathartic to be in B.J.’s shoes at that crucial moment when he takes back his life from Rip, who dies at the hands of his own son in defense of an America that, in his own words, has become “a white man’s world now.” And it is cathartic to take that rage and rip into Nazis for several more hours afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Wolfenstein: The New Colossus</span></i><span> could not have more perfectly matched the moment it emerged into. Its European developers definitely seem like they were tuned into the national conversation overseas and the growing political divide in America, but I don’t believe any of them would go so far as to say they predicted the exact descent into fascism which the game’s development and release would parallel. </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 3</span></i><span>, however, could be an entirely different story.</span></p> <p><span>Even if </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 3</span></i><span> is only in the earliest stages of production right now, it could still arrive near the end of Trump’s second presidency. And lord knows the material that MachineGames has to work with nowadays. That loser notion that Rip died defending? Well, that seems like the primary ambition of the current U.S. administration, which continues to stoke fires both abroad and at home in pursuit of this goal. Look no further than the way that the administration has continually sicced ICE–the </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-tool-to-monitor-phones-in-entire-neighborhoods/"><span>president’s own secret police</span></a><span> at this point–on American citizens in a manufactured war on immigrants, rounded people up into camps, and even claimed the lives of innocents, as many saw with the </span><a href="https://defector.com/ice-agent-kills-woman-dhs-tells-obvious-insane-lies-about-it"><span>murder of Renee Nicole Good</span></a><span> in Minneapolis on January 7.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If </span><i><span>The New Colossus</span></i><span> felt like a heightened, yet prescient take on the politics of the 2010s, what might a follow-up in the wake of the declining American empire under a second Trump administration look like? Neither you nor I can really say, but if it’s anything like its predecessors, it will be abrasive, unhinged, and rightfully angry at the rot we’ve observed in the time since </span><i><span>Wolfenstein </span></i><span>was last in the limelight. At the naked abuses of power which dominate our timelines and drive our seemingly routine descents into madness. At the normalization of Nazi shit and cruelty. I could use a place to vent all that frustration. Maybe, just maybe, </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 3 </span></i><span>will fill that role perfectly whenever it arrives.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Ghost of Yotei, ARC Raiders and Dispatch Lead 29th DICE Awards Nominations]]></title>

            <guid>1400959</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>29th annual DICE Awards</strong> are set for <strong>February 12, 2026</strong>, and the <a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp">full list of nominees has been revealed</a>, with an unsurprising list of games leading the way in nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong> lead the pack with <strong>eight nominations each,</strong> while <strong>Dispatch</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> tie for second place with <strong>six nominations each</strong>. All four titles are also nominated for the big prize, <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>The DICE Awards are hosted every year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, with the nominees and winners picked by an academy of more than 30,000 members of the video game industry. Similar to the GDC Awards, this is an awards show that is chosen by the developers, and made for developers to celebrate each other's work and lift up the latest and greatest in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Basically, if you think that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards</a> are nothing but a popularity contest and that the games' media critics who make up the judging panel don't know what they're talking about and/or you think they're only focused on trailers for new games and not focused enough on the actual awards themselves, then the DICE Awards are what you'll want to pay attention to.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, four out of the five choices for DICE's Game of the Year appear on <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's Best of 2025 list.</a> </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable nominees include Blue Prince, which has five nominations, including one for Game of the Year, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which has four nominations. </p>



<p>Some of the major differences between the DICE Awards and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">other major awards shows</a> that've already passed are the fact that Hollow Knight Silksong and Hades 2 are left off the Game of the Year list, with the former getting only one nomination and the latter getting three. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 also came up short with only three nominations, and Donkey Kong Bananza got two.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-wins-game-of-the-year-at-dice-awards-2025/">Last year's big winner was Astro Bot</a>, which took home five wins, including Game of the Year. Helldivers 2, Balatro, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle also came up with multiple wins, with four, three, and three awards each, respectively. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>’s third and final entry is still years away, but Square Enix is actively developing whatever comes after 2024’s </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>. The sequel was notoriously </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>minigame heavy</span></a><span>, and while the </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>trilogy already felt like it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221"><span>straining to make three games out of one</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s reliance on minigames to pad the length really pushed things past the limit. Other than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-cloud-aerith-sephiroth-1851374178"><span>its divisive ending</span></a><span>, it’s probably the most widely derided part of the game, but it doesn’t sound like this criticism has deterred Square from this approach.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>GamerBraves</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked about </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s inclusion of heaps of minigames, with interviewer Sean Lim noting that some players felt the onslaught interrupted the game’s pacing. Hamaguchi said that the team’s intention was to not only shake up what the player was doing throughout </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s lengthy runtime, but also pay homage to the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>, which had its fair share of minigames as well.</span></p>

  <blockquote><p><span>So, that’s not a unique problem for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> only. A lot of games, aside from the main theme and main story progression, also have the side games and the minigames built into them. So, we don’t think we’re unique in that aspect. So when you’re playing the game and you’re going through the main story progression, as well as the intended game design, you tend to fall into this trap of having the same tempo. So, you tend to get bored playing it. To sort of combat this and keep that fresh feeling of going through the game, that’s why we introduced these minigames, to sort of add a diversity of experience as you’re playing the game, to keep up the good rhythm, so to say. So we understand when you introduce these different facets, some people would play it and really enjoy it, but some people would rather just get on with the main story. So it’s sort of a calculated move on our part to include all these different facets of the game. Whether it’s the amount of minigames or the pacing [with which] we introduce them, so on the creator side, it’s sort of something we have taken into account when we do the game design.</span></p> <p><span>So the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> also had lots of minigames, and it was very famous for that. So, when [we] were entrusted with doing the remake, [we] sort of wanted to keep that spirit of the diversity of play within the title, so that people can have lots of different experiences the same way they did with </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I can appreciate wanting to be true to the original RPG’s minigames, but </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s obvious use of it as filler goes far beyond reimagining. It would be helpful if each diversion was good, but they varied from the good as hell </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood card game</span></a><span> to the infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cait-sith-box-throw-mod-remove-1851744876"><span>Cait Sith box throwing segment</span></a><span>. Walking through </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s open world was like trying to cross a minefield where the most obnoxious, unskippable landmines were waiting for you if you stepped in the wrong direction. </span></p>

 <p><span>Hamaguchi doesn’t say if this will persist into the next </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span> game, but he has said elsewhere that the third game will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>be more concise</span></a><span>, so hopefully that means&nbsp; the minigames get dialed down a bit in the final chapter. Or let Sephiroth strike me down.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sales over the holidays reportedly fell short of those recorded by the console's predecessor back in 2017, during its first end-of-year season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_NUBDTG8_4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Switch 2 sales in the US and within key markets in Europe fell behind the equivalent pace of Switch 1 — something an unnamed senior Nintendo source blamed on a "complicated" economic climate today, and the "absence of a major Western game" during the year-end period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That particular analysis will likely raise eyebrows among Nintendo fans, as the company launched the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> during the period — albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no announcement on how that game has fared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business reports that US Switch 2 sales over the holiday period were down around 35% versus the Switch 1's sales performance back in 2017. In the UK, a similar comparison saw Switch 2 lagging Switch 1 by 16%. Even in Nintendo's homeland of Japan, Switch 2 holiday sales couldn't match Switch 1, and were down by 5.5% over the year's final nine weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In France, 2025's final tally of Switch 2 sales was down by "over 30%" versus the amount Switch 1 notched up back in 2017, meanwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these numbers may take some of the shine off of a successful first year for Switch 2 overall, it's not all doom and gloom. Switch 2's lifetime sales in Japan are still above what Switch 1 managed in its first year, with less time on sale. And in the UK, Switch 1 continued to sell well enough that it made up Switch 2's holiday sales deficit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, Nintendo has a smattering of first-party games already planned for 2026, including Mario Tennis Fever, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, as well as Switch 2 upgrades for Super Mario Wonder and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There's also the FromSoftware exclusive The Duskbloods to look forward to, and the promising-looking Pokémon Pokopia life sim.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But as the Switch 2 prepares to celebrate its first anniversary in June, all eyes will be on Nintendo to roll out a truly new blockbuster entry in one of its biggest franchises. Back in 2017, Switch 1's first year was marked by the launch of both Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo has not released a major new 3D Mario platformer since, while it will soon be three years since the arrival of 2023's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 1's other top-selling titles include Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Animal Crossing: New Horizons — and for now, there's no suggestion a big new entry in either franchise is forthcoming. Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai has only just finished work on Kirby Air Riders, while Nintendo is opting to update New Horizons for Switch 2 this year, as previously mentioned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we see a new 3D Mario in 2026? Nine years on from Super Mario Odyssey, now feels like the right time. And then there's Pokémon, which celebrates its 30th anniversary next month. Could we get a glimpse soon of the series' long-awaited 10th generation? The arrival of these titles would certainly help Switch 2 keep its momentum, following last year's explosive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as "content complete" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Button Mash</a> podcast, Schreier said, "The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game." He added that he doesn't "think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November."</p><p>Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he "wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]." He also characterized some of the reports as, "a complete misunderstanding of what I said."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbw6vt7l3s25" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifmmw55edle55ebrtjxurpv4qjqd4af2eggqctnleafiyz5jz2saq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>This is a complete misunderstanding of what I said, which is that I wouldn't be shocked if GTA6 *does* come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as RDR2. Of course another delay is possible. It's a video game. But this blog post is very misleading (just reach out to me - it's not hard!)</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mbw6vt7l3s25?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow ">[image or embed]</a></p></div>  — Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow ">@jasonschreier.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3mbw6vt7l3s25?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow ">January 8, 2026 at 6:28 AM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>As Schreier and others have previously noted, Rockstar does have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">a history of delaying its AAA games</a>, and GTA 6 in particular has already been pushed back twice. It's been reported that the current delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-cost-rockstar-60-million-as-insiders-report-game-is-content-complete/1100-6536115/" data-ref-id="1100-6536115">may cost Rockstar upwards of $60 million</a>.</p><p>Some analysts continue to make the case that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">GTA 6 could be $100 for its standard edition</a>, which would potentially encourage other publishers to raise their prices as well. For now, Rockstar has yet to commit to a price for GTA 6.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19.</p>

<figure data-uuid="491ff96f5f5a9"><a title="Call of Duty Switch 2 Poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/491ff96f5f5a9/call-of-duty-switch-2-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>With rumours of the never-ending <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/call_of_duty_finest_hour">Call of Duty</a> franchise's imminent appearance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">once again doing the rounds</a> — following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">a 10-year agreement</a> to bring the series to Nintendo platforms as part of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, no less — we've been busy pondering just which of these storied shooters we'd like to see ported onto our new(ish) favourite platform first.</p>
<p>Yes, we know it's not going to work like that, most likely. We can't see them dropping a greatest hits first off, or even going with anything that'd make a bad first technical impression, so perhaps the newer stuff is out of the conversation. Also, this writer is of the opinion we're 100% going to see <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/call_of_duty_warzone">Warzone</a> as an opening gambit.</p>
<p>However! There's still plenty of fun to be had in discussing which one exactly we'd prefer to see arrive first, especially given there's so many diverse and exciting entries in a 22-year-old series that's all about shooting stuff at its core.</p>
<p>For me, it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/call_of_duty_infinite_warfare">Infinite Warfare</a> all day long, easily my favourite of the lot. I'd also choose <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_wwii">WWII</a> before any of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Black Ops</a> entries (yep, I said it), and even <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare">Advanced Warfare</a> would have been a grand old time had it not been for the Spacey sourness.</p>
<p>Enough about us, though (or me, even), we want to hear which of the following mainline Call of Duty games <em>you</em> would like to see on Switch 2. So take a gander at them long, long list of options below, and give your fave a click. Do it for Roach.</p>
