<p>Rubato launches this March</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Developer Headcannon, which perhaps most notably developed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a> alongside Christian Whitehead and PagodaWest Games, has announced the release date for its new game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rubato">Rubato</a>. The experimental 2D title will hit the Switch eShop on <strong>20th March 2026</strong>, and there's a free demo you can check out right now.</p>
<p>It's not been smooth sailing for Headcannon, however, as the developer recently released a blog post detailing "a rough few years", stating that all it wants to do is "make some damn games". It cites "corporate bureaucracy" as one of its headaches, along with personal difficulties and the cost of living.</p>
<p>Here's the post in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's been a rough few months.</p>
<p>"Hell.. it's been a rough few years. That's got a lot to do with our new slogan, which you may have noticed at the top of this page. Software Development is a complex process in the first place and doesn't need other forces to come along and make it even more challenging. Corporate bureaucracy certainly doesn't help whether you work from within or without "the industry", you have to be really careful about who you choose to work with and what you prioritize, the cost of living makes it less and less possible for an independent to spend time actually developing anything, I could go on listing issues we face that I'm sure other devs can sympathize with. Let's not even get into all the personal stuff that's befallen each of us lately. I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time complaining about it, but none of us want to pretend It's not extremely frustrating. I've personally always wanted to be as clear and straightforward as possible, and as independents, I'm hoping we can bring more of that to Headcannon. Given that, there seems to be only one thing left to say on the matter - "We just wanna make some damn games."</p>
<p>"We're still doing what we can. More (very) soon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rubato, meanwhile, is described as a Metroidvania of sorts, but judging from the trailer above, it's also loaded with awesome minigames and a sense of humour that we suspect might resonate quite well with us.</p>
<p>The game will also launch on Steam and PS5, though an Xbox release is currently TBA thanks to some complications with the Microsoft Partner Program backend.</p>

If you find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> too dark, perhaps you will like I Hate This Place, an isometric (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9fm7ej/why_is_everyone_mentioning_isometric_when_they/">is it, tho?</a>) survival horror based on the comic book of the same name from  Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin. I Hate This Place is dark – it has hungry tentacle nests, antlered stalkers, and spiders of many sizes – but going by the trailer, at least, it’s nothing like as harrowing and hollowing as the Acid Wizard game. The colours are bright and splashy, the munsters, funky: think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>.
</p>
<p>
It occurs to me that we need a thematic darkness scale for ‘dark’ video games, perhaps comparable to ocean depth categorisation. I’d say Darkwood is right down there in the hadopelagic trenches. I Hate This Place? A denizen of the upper bathypelagic (Midnight) zone, so far. Here's that trailer.

<p>
In I Hate This Place – which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">a demo on Steam</a> – you play Elena, a grumpy teenage girl exploring the forests, bunkers and derelict townships of a “cursed land”. There’s a day-night cycle: when the sun is up, you explore, find resources and blueprints, craft gear, and set up shelters. When the sun is down, you try not to die. 
</p><p>
The game’s humanoid mutants are blind, following the sound of your footsteps. As for the spiders, they range from swarms of baby arachnids in eggs to giant jumping varieties that pose as rocks. There’s also the requisite spider queen, who can tangle you in webs and impale you. All of these badniks are vulnerable to bullets, but I imagine it’s wiser to avoid them, for the most part.
</p>
<p>
What is Elena’s motivation, besides not getting squelched by a centaur or devoured by a tarantula? She is a chasing the spectre of the Horned Man. That'll be the dude who keeps doing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>-style cinematic stings at her while she's rifling through cupboards, I expect. She also has a missing mother. This seems like a foundation for psychodrama, though I’m not expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> levels of soap opera, going by the trailer. Elena sounds quite indifferent, for a girl at permanent risk of being skewered or torn in half. I'm not convinced she really <em>does</em> hate this place.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the game is out remarkably soon - 29th January, in fact. The devs recently did a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorGaming/comments/1po8r8w/we_are_the_developers_behind_i_hate_this_place/">Reddit AMA</a> if you want to hear more about difficulty modes, ammo scarcity and so forth.

              <p>A gremlin in Bungie’s backend was briefly trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">upsell <em>Marathon</em> players</a> on copies of<em> Destiny 2</em>. Players who tried to pre-order the upcoming extraction shooter ended up with <em>Destiny 2</em> sneaking onto their hard drives as well in what is one of the weirder digital installation bugs I’ve ever heard of.</p> <p>We know this was happening because Bungie publicly addressed it on X. “We’ve resolved an issue where<em> Destiny 2</em> would begin installing after pre-ordering <em>Marathon</em> on Steam,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147">wrote</a>. “We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p> <p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But that hasn’t stopped players from having a field day with the mere idea that Bungie wanted so desperately to enroll new players in its sci-fi loot shooter that it was forcibly installing <em>Destiny 2</em> on people’s computers like a cracked rom site virus.&nbsp;“<em>Marathon</em> used so many <em>Destiny 2</em> assets that it automatically downloaded the game when people pre-ordered <em>Marathon</em>,” joked one person. “<em>Marathon</em> comes with malware,” joked another.</p> <p>While Bungie didn’t explain why this happened, it probably has something to do with the pre-order bonuses. Buying <em>Marathon</em> ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975">its March 5 launch date</a> gives players free cosmetics for <em>Destiny 2</em>. Maybe a bug in the files was making it so the loot shooter would auto-download in order to register those rewards. Whatever the reason, it’s fixed now. <em>Destiny 2</em>, on the other hand, still not great.</p>

              <p>Ready to cut the cord and enjoy a hands-free, convenient viewing experience? A good streaming media player can help. Amazon’s Fire series features some of the best out there for users of all needs and budgets, and the retail giant is currently making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">You can now pick the latest Fire TV Cube at a rare 21% discount at Amazon. This brings its price down to just $110.</a> If you have an older model lying around, you can trade it in for an additional 20% discount. Your purchase will also come with a one-month trial to the Xbox GamePass if you’re a new user, which sweetens the offer even more. The discount is selling out fast, though. If you’ve been looking for an easy way of streaming better, now is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easier Navigation</h2>
<p>Featuring the new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor, the Fire TV Cube packs impressive performance in a compact build. It’s twice as powerful as the high-rated and widely loved Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you search for stuff and navigate around a lot more easily. There’s Wi-Fi 6E support for smoother 4K streaming with less interference from other household devices, which translates into better speeds and lower latency. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio. These come together to offer an immersive viewing experience for all your favorite shows and movies. Expect lifelike visuals for both all-time classics and latest releases, plus clearer audio and better dialogue.</p>
<p>Speaking of content, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes, including favorites from Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more. You can even use it as a speaker by listening to music on Spotify and other similar apps. Smart search capabilities with voice control take the experience even further. You can use your voice to command Alexa, plus find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, if you’re feeling like watching a good crime thriller, just say something like, “Alexa, show me the latest thrillers with a major plot twist”. Want to relax with a lighthearted comedy show? Try saying “Alexa, show me the best comedy TV shows of all times”, and the job will be done within seconds without you having to press any buttons or get up from the couch.</p>



<p>Alexa compatibility also lets you control your TV, soundbar, and other smart devices around the house easily. You can hop on video calls, check your schedule, and get a live view of your security camera in no time. Getting started with using the Fire TV Cube couldn’t be easier. All you need to do is connect the cube to your TV’s HDMI port and then the home internet. Make sure it’s placed at least one to two feet away from the speakers for ideal functionality. Once it’s connected to the internet, follow the instructions on your TV screen to complete the process.</p>
<p>You’ll also appreciate how the device takes privacy seriously with privacy protections and controls built right in. There’s an off button on the cube that lets you disconnect the microphones when it’s not in use, for added peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Note that Amazon is also offering a free upgrade to its smartest AI assistant – the Alexa+ – with this offer.</a> The early access is expected to last through the end of January, so there’s still time to try it out without paying anything extra.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop Has Patched the ‘Infinite Money’ Trade Glitch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-has-patched-the-infinite-money-trade-glitch/</link>
            <guid>1411894</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GameStop has issued a statement revealing that the ‘Infinite Money Glitch’ used when trading in items has been patched. </p>



<p>GameStop is one of the few offline video game stores that continues to operate effectively, consistently providing new deals and offers to its customers. Just two months ago, they launched a unique promotion called “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trade Anything Day</a>.” Now, they have introduced a new offer on pre-owned games. However, some customers took unfair advantage of this promotion, prompting GameStop to put an immediate stop to it.</p>







<h2 id="h-customers-were-buying-and-trading-in-the-switch-2-at-gamestop-for-extra-credit">Customers Were Buying and Trading in the Switch 2 at GameStop for Extra Credit </h2>



<p>This is how the infinite money glitch worked at GameStop stores. The company was offering a 25% bonus on the trade-in value of any pre-owned item. Customers would buy a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99, along with a pre-owned game that costs no more than $0.99. When they traded in both of these items, a promotional bonus was triggered, increasing the trade credit to $472.50. This effectively gave the customer $57.51 in store credit.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEgSUUJ758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber</a> who exposed this glitch revealed that they were able to make $600 across both their trade cards and also get the Switch 2 they traded for at an even lower price, since it was tagged as pre-owned once it was traded in. </p>



<p>GameStop has now issued a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> revealing that customers could repeat this process as many times as they wanted, creating an infinite money glitch. However, the glitch has been patched, and customers will not be able to “convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream.” At the same time, the company will not stop promotions, and even though they “applaud the creativity,” they don’t want their stores to be used as “infinite money printers”. </p>



<p>Check out GameStop’s complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>GameStop is aware of the “GameStop Infinite Money Glitch,” exposed by YouTuber RJCmedia. </p>



<p>By purchasing a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99 and then immediately trading it back in along with the purchase of a pre-owned game, a promotional bonus was triggered that increased the Switch 2 trade credit to $472.50. </p>



<p>In short, our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit. </p>



<p>Effective immediately, the glitch has been patched. Trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored. </p>



<p>GameStop remains committed to offering promotions that reward our customers, and while we applaud the creativity, we gently remind everyone that our stores are not designed to function as infinite money printers.</p>

<p><strong>The official release date for The Midnight Walkers is January 29, but players in some regions will be able to play a day earlier.</strong></p>



<p>Developer Oneway Ticket Studio is based in Korea, so release times are adapted to their time zone, which means the official release date isn’t actually solid. Instead, it flows with the regions of the world, but the doors will open to players simultaneously.</p>



<p>The Midnight Walkers does not have a staggered release, so there won’t be any situations where players in one region can access the game while others are locked out, and the length of the wait is the same for all players.</p>



<p>However, theoretically at least, some players will be able to play ahead of the official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-midnight-walkers-countdown-exact-start-time">The Midnight Walkers Countdown: Exact Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>The Midnight Walkers official release time is 6 PM PT on January 28, with the exact time of entry varying for players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>Release times come from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2795540/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, which shows that players in the United States will be able to start playing the game earlier than the official January 28 release date.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact start time for The Midnight Walkers in major time zones across the world, so you can jump in as soon as the doors open. If there are any changes to the release times, this guide will be updated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Way back in April of last year, Blizzard began making gestures at something that would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-is-getting-a-one-button-option-that-will-automatically-cast-the-ideal-next-spell-but-at-a-cost">eventually be called "add-on disarmament,</a>" effectively an effort to make competitive play in World of Warcraft significantly less reliant on externally downloaded mods, or add-ons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, nine months later, those efforts are well underway, and uh, they haven't gone over <em>amazingly.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-is-seemingly-about-to-kill-the-games-biggest-mods">premise doesn't sound bad on paper</a>. Initially, Blizzard talked about implementing some new in-game tools that would theoretically take the place of a lot of functions players typically wanted add-ons for. This started with rotation assistance, and has since followed in the World of Warcraft: Midnight alpha and beta with other new features such as a cooldown manager, damage meters, and other improvements. The idea is that Blizzard wants to put an end to situations where players feel compelled to download external programs for a competitive advantage in dungeons, raids, or other content. Meanwhile, the studio has said it doesn't intend to touch add-ons that are purely cosmetic, such as those that offer item or merchant organization tools, quest support, or various visual customizations. Those add-ons can stay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, on the cusp of Midnight's release though, some players are still unhappy with how disarmament has turned out. Admittedly, a lot of Blizzard's new tools are excellent. The rotation assists are helpful, the damage meters are extremely accurate, and a lot of the new tools were sorely needed for a long time. But the total loss of some of the game's most popular mods (most notably WeakAuras, which essentially let players display all sorts of custom graphics and information in their game based on a variety of factors, most notably to help with combat encounters) has many hardcore players frustrated. With add-ons no longer able to draw from in-game combat information in order to function, players have lost UI set-ups, character configurations, or helpful tools they've relied on for years. It's a rough transition!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just ahead of the 12.0 pre-patch heralding the coming of Midnight, we sat down with game director Ion Hazzikostas to talk to him about how disarmament is going, and what the plans for the future of World of Warcraft's relationship with mods might be. Here's our interview in full below, lightly edited for length and clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It's been about nine months since you first started talking about add-on disarmament, around the one-button rotation idea when we first talked about that. And then it's been about four months since you began really implementing it in a way that players could see and mess around with an Alpha and Beta. So, how do you feel it's gone so far?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ion Hazzikostas: </strong>Overall, we're happy with how things have gone. We knew that this was going to be complicated. We knew it was going to be contentious. Certainly, it's a large set of changes. And I think the path that we followed over the course of Alpha and Beta was really to start by rolling out what we saw as the most restrictive version of add-on API permissions possible, to ensure that we were hitting the mark in terms of preventing the computational stuff that worried us most. And then that cleared the air for us to spend the next few months shoring up our baseline offerings and working with the add-on developer community to restore functionality that was collateral damage. So, I think it's been movement in one direction, pretty much in terms of more and more customization, more flexibility from September through today. And as we're here on the cusp of launch, I think I feel good about what we're going to be offering. And of course the work continues in terms of continuing to improve the base UI, continuing to work with add-on developers beyond launch. But we feel we've covered the essentials for the baseline experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you find that that's reflected in player feedback? Because at least in the forums that I poked my nose into, people still seem to not be super thrilled.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I mean, I think there's a mix of experiences and perspectives. I think the nature of discussion on the topic is inherently going to be a bit skewed towards people who are concerned about the changes. Because ultimately, if you're someone who doesn't use a bunch of add-ons, or you welcome these changes, there isn't a lot to talk about really with regard to that. You're just focused on other aspects of Midnight. Whereas, understandably for a lot of players who use add-ons heavily, who rely on them in the live game and The War Within today, the prospect of significant change can be an unsettling one. And there's been a lot of changes to the landscape over the last few months. I think a big area of focus for us a couple of months ago was people being surprised that add-ons that they were used to using that didn't seemingly offer any competitive advantage, were apparently not going to be able to function in Midnight. I'm talking about add-ons like ElvUI or Console Port or Bartender. And that was entirely unintended collateral damage, but became the subject of a lot of intensive collaboration between our UI engineers and the add-on development community as we did work to give them new functions, new API hooks, to ensure that they could keep as much of this benign functionality present.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, for the majority of people, if you're an ElvUI user, let's say, you can update your UI next week and roll right into 12.0 and the Midnight pre-launch experience with most of what you're still comfortable with and accustomed to visually. And just some of the restricted competitive advantage functionality won't be there, but we've done everything possible to make this as the least disruptive experience it can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you have any metrics related to what percentage of users actually use add-ons? And if so, how many use certain popular ones that were maybe targeted by this change, WeakAuras or something like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the majority of users use add-ons in some form. I think it's something like, 65% or 70% of players have at least one add-on. Now, there's a huge gamut that's captured by that, obviously. I think the single most popular add-on to our knowledge is some form of damage meter. So, no surprise that that was very high on the list of things that we knew we needed to offer baseline, if we're restricting the ability to parse combat events in real time. And really, to be fair, that is a great example of something that should have been part of the baseline client for years now. And that we knew add-ons could do it, so it wasn't a priority in the same way as it might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not being able to really understand your performance or whether the talents you chose are doing better for you or worse, without using an external tool, is something that we're glad to have addressed. A lot of the other most popular add-ons are mostly cosmetic in nature, or things that help with collections, or other quality of life that we're trying, that shouldn't be directly impacted or are minimally impacted. And then, I think as you go on down the list from there, there are definitely suites of tools that help with encounters and combat enhancement. And that functionality is what's going to be restricted, but it's with the goal of creating a more level playing field, where players don't need to turn to these outside resources in order to succeed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And rather, add-ons can be about personalizing the experience in ways that suit you, rather than feeling you need add-ons that the community is asking you or requiring you to use because they're broadly agreed to be an objective advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why did you end up choosing to suddenly overhaul the add-on landscape the way you did, as opposed to developing these replacements while the add-ons still existed and then having maybe a more gradual transition?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: I think it's something that, once we were resolved that a change needed to occur here, really requires a pretty clearly demarcated cutover. A world where add-ons existed in their full computational glory, and we were trying to build up some baseline offerings, is a world in which the majority of players would continue to use the full power of what add-ons could provide, where we would have to design around those add-ons. We never designed for add-ons, but we can't ignore the tools that players are using to face the challenges that we're creating. And so, it would have been another full expansion of pretty much what players have become accustomed to. There's upsides and downsides there. I think it's not something we took lightly at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But recognizing that this is a change that needed to happen on an expansion boundary, we spent most of the last year and a half thinking about what needed to change, how we would approach it, and how we would handle the rollout, with a bunch of check-ins along the way, to ensure that we felt good about successfully accomplishing this changeover in the Midnight expansion. There were points along the way where, if it felt this wasn't going to come together and wasn't going to be the experience our players deserve, we would have pivoted and either delayed it or taken a different approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But part of the last several months has been building confidence, making sure we're hearing all of the feedback from as many parts of the community as possible, including our add-on developers, and that we're able to address that feedback and feel good about where we're going to land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I have a bunch of questions about very specific things that are either impacted or notably have not been impacted by this change that I wanted to ask you about. So, I'm going to drill down a little bit. To start, do you have any plans to overhaul the current floating combat text feature? I know that add-ons in the past have allowed for more customizability that's no longer available.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I think that is an area that is on our internal roadmap, but it hasn't been a priority. Because ultimately, it's largely cosmetic in nature. We've tried to focus on the areas that were going to be more impactful to people's experience first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Current UI allows percentage-based scaling of various things, unit frames and stuff like that. Is there any thought to getting that updated to support independent XY scaling? So, if you want a health bar that's really long horizontally, can it not be three inches thick vertically?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Yeah. I think so, those are things we would like to continue to expand and we are continuing to expand Edit Mode functionality and the ways in which the base UI can be aesthetically tweaked. That said, that aesthetic space really is where add-ons shine. There are countless preferences that players have, for size, shape, color, flare, you name it. And add-ons continue to offer all of the power to customize that experience robustly. We want to be a bit wary of going too far with our built-in customization because that also adds layers of complexity to the interface and to the advanced options.</p><p>If we're trying to offer options to suit every player's niche preferences, that experience is going to be very, very bloated.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If we're trying to offer options to suit every player's niche preferences, at some point, that experience is going to be very, very bloated, versus people who want a particular look and are accustomed to it being able to just got an add-on that does what they want. To be clear, we embrace the power of add-ons to improve players' experience in customizing the look and feel of World of Warcraft. It's been a strength for 21 years. We do not want to change that. We do not want to retreat from that. And so, I think for purely cosmetic stuff, that hasn't been a priority for that reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And there's not any effort from you to stop people from having an add-on that changes the look of their boss frames or their raid frames or things like that, right? Even visual stuff that touches combat in that way. That's still something we'll be able to do.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Exactly. I think, altering the look and feel of the user interface of how information is presented, the size of things, the fonts, the colors, the shapes, that's something that we are fully supporting. That's not something we ever had any desire to restrict. The only place where there are restrictions are where combat logic is driving specific things. Where based on knowing that you have spell X, Y, Z on you, it's making a special visual appear that's just tied to that spell or something along those lines. Something that really was a big focus of our Alpha and Beta experience was understanding and fixing a lot of the collateral damage that our initial changes resulted in, for cosmetic add-ons. I've mentioned add-ons like ElvUI earlier in the conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are the sorts of things that we never intended to break, but because of quirks of how certain add-ons were authored, 10+ years ago, when their developers first put them together, there were aspects of how they were approaching things that are incompatible with the current approach, but that's no fault of their own. That's just the approach they happened to pick a dozen years ago. And so, I know it was very concerning and alarming to a lot of players, who were hearing us talking about wanting to disarm combat enhancing competitive add-ons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then, we're hearing that the add-on they relied on to make their unit frames have a different aesthetic was no longer functioning, or the add-on that they relied on to be able to easily plug a controller in and play the game on a game pad was no longer going to function. We've done work and collaboration with the add-on development community to give them hooks, to give them new tools to ensure the continued functionality of those add-ons. So, for a ton of people, this will just be a matter of updating their add-ons, like they do for any new expansion and having all the aesthetic customizations they're used to, still in place, untouched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I do think some of the frustration I'm seeing, and I'm having this problem too. I had maybe four total add-ons installed: DBM, Bagnon, probably something else, and then WeakAuras. And I used WeakAuras for rotation help, but I also used it to customize my UI and it was all just there, in one big box. And so, with that going away, I now have to seek out a bunch of other add-ons to recreate the experience that I had before. And it's not just WeakAuras, but there are other add-ons as well that have been affected because of the combat element of it that now, people have to go out and find substitutes. And that seems to be where a lot of the frustration seems to lie on the customization aspects.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> And that's understandable. We can't directly control what add-on developers choose to do. We can't make an add-on developer keep developing the add-on if they're no longer interested in doing that. I think we've tried to provide support where we could, to ensure that things continue to be possible. Many add-on authors have continued to carry their work forward. Some have not, and that is going to cause some users to need to find alternate solutions. But those have been popping up in numerous supply over recent weeks and months. We expect that to only continue. We wish we could have done more to limit the need for people to find new solutions, but we've focused on what we can control and trying to help support the community as best we can.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One more question on UI while we're on it. Is there any thought to letting players be able to set a default UI or default settings for all new characters, instead of having to set it up each time? Not even just visual stuff, but even stuff just like Auto-Loot not being an account-wide selection or something like that. So, that when I make a new character, I don't immediately have to go fix the Auto-Loot stuff, and where the bars start out, and everything else.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: That's an excellent point and request. I think there are several of our settings that are account-wide. There are still a bunch that are character-specific. A challenge there is that some people do prefer things meaningfully different on a DPS versus a Healer alt or vice versa. So, when we make things account-wide, often, we get complaints and push back in the opposite direction. They have to go back and undo or change things. But agreed, things Auto-Loot and the like should be as consistent as possible. I think that's something I could take back and look at with the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, WeakAuras is gone. We're relying on the cooldown manager now to provide us information. Do you feel that the cooldown manager, as it is, is fairly complete in terms of the information that you want it to display for people or are there still areas where you feel you need to add more?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I think it's in a really solid place for launch. There are planned areas where we want to add further polish and customization. I think a big one that we've talked about is the ability to add more custom items, or trinkets, or potions, or things, anything that has a cool down or timer. Ideally, you'd be able to drag that into the cooldown manager and track it there if you want. The initial focus has very much been on class abilities and rotation, but there are other things that are outside your character that fit into that ecosystem. And so, that's something that we're working on that's part of our roadmap for 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside that stuff, filtering what buffs anddDebuffs show on party and raid frames, I don't really need to know that everybody in the raid has a 10-minute cooldown on lust. I'm a Shaman, I know that, but maybe when I'm playing my healer, I do want to know who's got Riptide on them or something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: I think so. The ability to filter, highlight, exclude specific buffs and debuffs, particularly on raid frames is something that has come up a lot, that the team talks about a lot. Our focus right now, and there's more work being done on this, as we polish things for launch, is to improve the default, in terms of visibility. I completely agree, that Sated or the like just doesn't need to show up on frames. It's not useful information, that's clutter. Our perspective is that you shouldn't need to download an add-on to be able to hide that clutter, that it should be something that we are doing for you, that the defaults out of the box should be reasonable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as we get into more power user functionality, I think there's definitely an appetite for the ability to prioritize or exclude things based on more fine-tuned inputs. That was not something we saw as a requirement at launch, but based on feedback and how things play out following launch, it may be something we add to the base UI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Thinking about the damage meter, the information is still paired down from what some of the other add-ons like Details used to provide. So players who want that information have to go to external sites like Warcraft Logs to get information. Is that something you're thinking of filling out eventually?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I think we definitely drew a line with some of the power user functionality that some of the more popular damage meter add-ons provided. I think we're always trying to strike a balance between, "What is a broadly approachable experience that all players, including those who aren't necessarily doing high-end content, want to use and be able to understand what's there?", versus "What really gets into more fine-tuned analysis?" And the ability to take a combat log and export that and analyze that if you really want to dissect how this five-minute raid encounter went for you and understand how your cool-downs were lining up and what your uptime was and your abilities, external tools are and continue to be great for that.</p><p>We are trying to strike a balance between offering advanced functionality for players who want it, without overwhelming others.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think that's where a lot of that stuff has already happened historically. So, I think we focused more on the in-the-moment, "As I'm running this dungeon, as I'm doing this raid, or right after it completes, I want to get a sense of how I stacked up compared to my groupmates, how I stacked up compared to my performance from last time," and some of the obvious stuff there. But as always, we're going to continue to listen to feedback. If there are categories, if there's specific parts of the damage meters that players feel need improvement or that are missing, we're going to continue to expand upon them going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It really does go back to a theme that I feel we just run up to again and again, when we're interviewing about any subject. It's that ultimately the loudest segment of the WoW populice are naturally the hardcore users, but there's a quieter segment of players just doing dungeons and not necessarily playing that way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I think we are trying to strike a balance always between offering the advanced functionality for players who want it, without overwhelming players who are already potentially struggling to wrap their heads around all of the complexities of World of Warcraft and its layered systems. And so, that's an area where add-ons continue to provide a lot of value. If people want specific tailored customization of the way information is presented, that is what add-ons are for. Even if we could, it would actually not improve the experience for most people, for us to bake all of that functionality and all of those options and bells and whistles into the base UI, it would make it an overwhelming experience for most players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is your overall vision for support around these features, UI, the cooldown manager, things like that going forward? Should we be expecting new features and updates every patch? Is it just limited to expansion releases, just major patches? What's the thought?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>No, I think definitely updates with certainly every major patch and many of our minor patches. This is going to be a mix of polish and a mix of responding to the feedback that we're getting for areas where players want to see the base UI improved. I think there are a couple of areas right now where add-ons can still offer some very useful customization of your experience that we would like to see the base UI offer down the line. For example, in Midnight, we built a new dungeon and raid encounter timeline system with Boss Alerts, and it shows you the abilities that are upcoming and when they're on fire. Players have often requested the ability to filter out or highlight specific abilities within that framework.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe you're a healer and you don't care about something that only damage dealers care about or vice versa, and so, you want to filter it out. Add-ons today will let you still do that in Midnight. A lot of the common raid add-ons are now going to be a layer of visual customization on Blizzard's native tools. But down the line, we'd love to be able to let players go into the Dungeon Journal and on an ability-by-ability basis, choose what they want to suppress, what they might want to super emphasize, things along those lines. It's not something we want to restrict add-ons' ability to do, but we want to make it so that that functionality is there in the base UI if you want it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there a sense that a lot of this is going to still effectively be being beta-tested even after Midnight launches?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: I don't think so. I mean, I think the beta test is what's going on now and it's wrapping up, and the reams of feedback that we've gotten from that have informed what we're doing at launch. Now, that's not to say that we're not still listening to feedback and that we're not going to continue to improve things, but we have accomplished everything that we set out to accomplish with this rollout. We had an internal roadmap, a list of features and sub-features we needed to add and felt were essential to address. All of those are present, but of course, we're going to continue to listen to what players are looking to see more of or see less of, and evolve the feature going on beyond launch and thereafter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There </strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/addons-continue-to-provide-a-massive-advantage-in-midnight-despite-blizzards-379870?utm_source=fuckoff" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was a Wowhead post a couple days ago that</a><strong>-</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>...was criticizing this whole situation. So, you've seen it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas</strong>: Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The big take away from it is the idea that, in trying to dismantle a certain class of add-ons and bring that functionality in-game, you've essentially pushed people to just use more different, worse add-ons. Because they went point by point and showed off all these things that you could still do that theoretically you shouldn't be able to do, that add-ons are providing. What's the response to that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I mean, I think that theoretically, "Shouldn't be able to do," is very debatable. But I think if you shouldn't be able to do it, we're not letting you do it. And I think there are areas where players are interpreting some compromises that we've landed on, based on feedback from the community, as us either failing in our goals or backpedaling in those goals. I think we always set out to say, "We're going to roll out the most restrictive version of this implementation at the start of Alpha, and then we're going to spend the next several months triaging based on feedback, and restoring things, and building on this new foundation to get to a place where players have the functionality that they want."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft Early Access Housing Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, again, the fact that aesthetic customization, that you can customize the sounds that are associated with certain abilities, things along those lines is possible, is not a misfire on our part, that's deliberate. There's a lot of accessibility value for a lot of that functionality. And I think everyone agrees that the computational stuff that has been our focus from the beginning here is no longer possible, that dynamically solving problems based on real-time combat information is not a thing add-ons can do. Now, if you want something to remind you to cast Tranquility at three minutes and 30 seconds into a fight, you could put something on a second monitor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if we didn't allow it in-game, it's not really worth our time to try to further lock something like that down in ways that will just cause more collateral damage. So, I think overall, where we have landed is a pretty deliberate result. And yes, there are a couple of places where because certain add-ons have discontinued development, players are needing to turn to find new solutions. I think that transition is understandably and regrettably, going to be a source of frustration for some players, but on the other side of it, we should have a new stable norm and a new world in which we're all living together, and it's only going to continue to get better from there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I don't want to harp on this, but I do think the bit that concerned me the most from that was one of the examples they gave was, a dungeon or a raid encounter where the idea is you want to kill a group of enemies in a pretty specific order. And they had found an add-on that would basically mark them in the correct order, which does seem to be, on the fly, problem solving for the player.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And so, my concern is that, like I said, I have three, four add-ons maybe. Am I suddenly going to have to go into Midnight and find out that my raid leaders are saying, "Hey, you need to download these six extra add-ons because they disabled the Weak Aura functionality for this, but we need these to solve these encounters."</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> Our goal is for the answer to that to be no. The specific encounter that's being referenced was a Mythic mechanic on the Saldahar encounter late in the raid. There are a couple of loopholes that clever add-on developers have found that are still being closed. So, there's this cat-and-mouse game that's going on, but we're actually redesigning a portion of that mechanic to make it less about this solvable predefined order and more about just reacting to how the encounter flows. I think it's fair to say that if there are places where your raid leader tells you that you need to download a certain add-on, that's something that we're very interested in and would see as something that we need to change something to resolve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be something about our encounter design, it could be something about how our add-on API works, but ideally, you are choosing the add-ons that make your personal experience suit you the best and that should be something that is personal. It should not be something that is a community norm that's imposed upon you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, it sounds like there are at least some differences in the 12.0 release, from what we're seeing on the Beta right now, updates, things that you've fixed. How different should we expect the add-on landscape to look like in the full release from what it is on beta?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>So, it should match what's on beta, so technically we have a 12.0 patch, which is going live next week, and that has most of our systems changes, Transmog, stat squish, our pre-launch events, et cetera. But then there's a 12.0.1, small, just background systems update that's going to go live in mid-February. That's actually what's running in our beta right now. And so, there's a few more weeks of development represented in that, which includes fixes to bugs, polished to some of the add-on functionality, some new improvements to things, damage meters and more. People who are playing on the beta, I mean, week over week, you'll see changes pushed in new builds, but that experience should match what you see when Midnight goes live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>But it sounds like the goal is to close at least some of these loopholes by the time the raids are active.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Certainly, yes. I can promise that that specific mechanic is not going to play out the way it did in the article that highlighted. And that's part of the feedback we've been getting over the course of the last couple of months. I mean, I think that was one that was spotlighted, but there are other areas where raiders and folks who are very sophisticated, add-on developers testing our encounters, have pointed out places where, "Hey, there is a loophole here," or "Hey, players, if nothing changes, we are going to be able to do this and therefore, feel like we have to do this. " And that has led to changes in encounters. It's led to changes now on functionality, which is part of the point. This all needs to be harmonious and we're on the road towards delivering this ideal experience in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is the best way to give you guys feedback? There's not really a feedback system in-game.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I mean, no, there are bug report suggestion and feedback tools for anyone who's playing the alpha or beta that are parsed, are read, are aggregated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I mean on live, though.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>On live, it's mainly various online discussions. Forums, social media, Reddit, YouTube, we're watching all of it. Players share their thoughts with each other and with us in a lot of different venues. And I think part of being a developer in a modern live service environment is going to seek out the feedback in all of those places to really understand what your players want and what you need to change.</p><p>We could have done more to communicate upfront, early in alpha and beta, about a more detailed roadmap of what was already in flight.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you never going to add the feedback form from beta to live?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I wouldn't say never. It's not currently a plan though. We are actually working on having tools to do some in-game surveys to better capture maybe some of the player experience or perspectives that aren't as represented on forums or social media. Because again, it tends to be, as you noted earlier, an area of discourse that's a bit more dominated by some of our more hardcore play styles, and frustrations people are having with role play, with quests, with some of the more solo activities, aren't necessarily bubbling up in the same way as in those mediums.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How do you feel that your relationship with add-on developers has been over the course of this? Does it seem like things are cool coming out of here or is this a relationship that needs to be repaired?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>That's a great question. It's hard to aggregate such a diverse community into a single sentiment assessment, but I think it's fair to say that there were, for sure, a couple of rocky months early in alpha and beta as we pulled back the curtain. Invited them into Alpha, but also rolled out restrictions and changes that were pretty wide sweeping. And it wasn't clear what was going to last, what we were going to improve. And a lot of authors were left questioning whether they'd be able to continue serving and supporting their communities. We've done as much as possible over the last few months to have very direct dialogue with the maintainers of these add-ons, to understand what obstacles they were running into as they were trying to update their add-ons for Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a huge portion of the work, that isn't the stuff that's captured in week-over-week Beta patch notes or the like, has been improving and adding to our add-on API that's available to add-on developers, to interface with the game to let them solve the problems that they were running into. And so, when you've seen a couple of notable add-ons announce back in October, that they were ceasing development and weren't going to be able to support things from Midnight, that have now been able to come back and say, "Okay, actually we are going to have Midnight version." That's been the result of that collaboration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I'm not going to pretend that that wasn't a stressful experience for many of those add-on developers, but I feel we are incredibly appreciative of the partnership and excited to continue to work together to offer as much power, as much customization, to players as they want in this new era while clawing back that competitive advantage piece of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I recognize this is a very unique situation, and there is nothing that's going to be identical to this that you are probably ever going to do in the future of WoW. But is there anything about how this rollout happened: how you announced it, how you communicated it, how you worked with the community on it, that you have either learned or would do differently for future big changes to the game that might unsettle people? Or do you feel that this was largely about how you would want to do big changes in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> That's a great question. I may have a fuller perspective on it in a couple more months. I think that we definitely could have done more to communicate upfront, early in alpha and beta, about a more detailed roadmap of what was already in flight, what we were planning to change, what people were seeing that wasn't a reflection of what we intended to ship, but was just our initial implementation, knowing that we were going to loosen things based on feedback. I think that a lot of players, because of those early weeks, a lot of the uncertainty and a lot of the anxiety that we saw across the community was a result of, potentially, misunderstandings of how things were going to land. And I can't count how many people I saw talking about, "Well, I uninstalled all my add-ons to get used to how things are going to be in Midnight because Blizzard's killing add-ons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it's, "No, we're not. We're very specifically doing everything we can to preserve the majority of add-ons the players use today." But I think the shorthand of, "Oh, Midnight's the add-on apocalypse," "Add-ons are going away," I think, led a lot of players to be very concerned and it required lots of rounds of communication to make it clear what was and wasn't changing. And I'm sure that for many people, it's still going to be... They won't fully wrap their heads around it until they're experiencing it next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've drawn a pretty clear line here that add-ons drawing combat data are out, but everything else, customization wise, still fine. Is that a line you would ever move in the future? Do you see there ever being a point in time where you're, "Actually, we need to be even more strict on add-ons?"</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>I think that's unlikely. I think it's very unlikely. I think that part of why we rolled out what we saw as a pretty strict ironclad rule set in September was so that we would only have to move in a generous direction of permitting and enabling and unlocking functionality rather than having to be in this back-and-forth game of locking things down and playing whack-a-mole. Now, I'm sure there will be some limited areas where very clever players and add-on developers find loopholes, find basically some exploits where they can find a way to get at some of this information. Those we would respond to by locking down. But the goal there is for that to be almost imperceptible. We fixed a bug, we fixed an exploit, not we're going to take some entirely new class of information and protect that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that we very much are committed to the continued vitality of the add-on ecosystem as a way of players being able to customize the look and feel of their experience, and also express themselves. And I think that's been part of WoW strength from the start and not something we want to let go of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything to the speculative rumor situation around the pulling back on add-ons being related to eventually considering some console release for World of Warcraft?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> There's no direct connection there. I mean, that may be a bridge that we cross at some point, but I think in general, the goal has always been for us, just approachability of the game and the deep-seated belief that the game should be playable out of the box. That we're not doing our duty as developers if, in order to play the game seriously, it is just taken as a maximum that you have to pull in all these third-party tools in order to play effectively. And we were faced with the choice of just accepting that as the continued future of World of Warcraft or making a change. And I think you mentioned, we've been talking about this since earlier in last year, I would say, really, it was the end of 2024 when we first began to float this philosophical direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this isn't a change that we made just to suit our own whims as developers. It's a change that was made informed by the feedback we've heard from broad swaths of the community who, while of course they want the transition to be managed as smoothly as possible, we're tired of feeling they needed to download these add-ons. They were being forced to do them if they wanted to engage in the content that they preferred. And that's really what led us to this point. And I think as we particularly look towards Midnight, look towards broadening the appeal and the range of activities that exist in Azeroth, namely housing, we want to make sure that there's few barriers to entry and into really getting into all of the depth that World of Warcraft has to offer, and add-ons have traditionally been one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm almost out of time, but I have a couple last weird bonus weird questions that I wanted to ask since I have an extra minute. Is there any thought to considering pet battle combat as combat for add-on purposes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> In the sense of add-ons giving you an advantage?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas:</strong> I mean, technically, yes, but I think that we have never tried to make pet battles a hyper-competitive, bleeding-edge activity, and that to the extent that players want to use assistance to help them with that, it doesn't seem an area that's of major concern to players. And so, we're not looking to solve problems that aren't player complaints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And last one related to UI, are you ever going to add in baked-in coordinates on the map?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hazzikostas: </strong>Yes, that is something that we definitely want to do. If you're looking up a quest on Wowhead or wherever and you're seeing a location, you shouldn't have to use an add-on or some convoluted system to interpret that in the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1411879</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">At a glance, there are many reasons to be at least a little bit hopeful about Prime Video’s plans to adapt the Norse duology of God of War. Ronald D. Moore is a tried and tested showrunner, having helmed both Battlestar Galactica and Outlander, among others. And Ryan Hurst, who played Thor in God of War: Ragnarok, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-show-finds-its-kratos-in-ragnarok-alum-ryan-hurst">is a promising if surprising lead</a>. The celebrated Frederick E.O. Toye of Shōgun is set to direct the first two episodes, while Cory Barlog – the franchise’s creative shepherd – will serve as an executive producer, not unlike Bethesda’s Todd Howard on Prime’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout</a> or Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann on HBO’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us</a>, two of the finest game adaptations of all time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, like Kratos, I have a hard time letting my guard down. Yes, Moore has a pretty nice track record, but he’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025">told IGN that he is “not a gamer”</a> – something that could prevent him from grasping the God of War experience in its entirety. Hurst clearly knows how to play big, angry guys, but can he live up to the legacy of Christopher Judge? As for Barlog: George R.R. Martin serves as an EP on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones-house-of-the-dragon">House of the Dragon</a>, but that has not prevented showrunner Ryan Condal from straying further and further away from the source material, the way Benioff and Weiss did with Game of Thrones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above all, I’m reminded of that cringeworthy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/god-of-war-ascension-from-ashes-live-action-trailer">live-action Super Bowl commercial for God of War: Ascension</a> from 2013 – the one where Calliope turns to ash in Kratos’ arms to the sound of Ellie Goulding’s “Hanging On.” Even as an obsessive teenager amassing piles of Collector’s Editions and bombarding the inbox of Santa Monica Studio’s HR department with ideas for sequels involving Ra, Buddha, and Jesus, I couldn’t help but feel that there was something off about seeing Kratos as an actual human being as opposed to an in-game model.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So when it comes to this Prime series, there are a couple of challenges. First, a relatively minor issue: what about Greece? More than a few fans were frustrated to learn that the show will only cover God of War 2018 and God of War: Ragnarok, rather than work their way up from the original trilogy. They’re right to be upset, as the Norse games <em>need</em> the Greek ones to make sense, and the same can be said about any adaptation, should they want to make the same impact. Start with 2018 and you won’t fully understand why Kratos is so afraid and ashamed of his past, why he’s hesitant to open up to Atreus. Likewise, you’ll miss out on the meaning and pathos of one of the best moments in the entire series: the return of the Blades of Chaos. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several solutions present themselves. The adaptation could sum up the entire Greek saga in an immersive, stage-setting episode à la the preamble of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/one-battle-after-another">One Battle After Another</a>, or it could deliver the story piecemeal through flashbacks. Or it could just do what the 2018 game does: have Kratos drip-feed his past, his confessions drawn out by the twists and turns encountered on the journey with his son. If anything, Moore and his writing team shouldn’t feel like they owe new audiences exposition: the mystery of Kratos’ relationship with Atreus, why he keeps a distance from this otherwise nice boy, should be enough to keep them engaged.</p><p>Live-action has struggled to depict the kind of extended one vs. one confrontations between superpowered individuals that video games excel at.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other, bigger issue requires some explanation. In hindsight, it isn’t surprising that Fallout and The Last of Us were the ones to definitively break the game adaptation curse. Both franchises are, first and foremost, vehicles for storytelling. In Bethesda’s case, players create their own stories through sandbox gameplay and dialogue options; in Naughty Dog’s games, stories are told directly by the developers, their cinematic style blurring the line between games and movies. The transition from one medium to another is fluid, almost logical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Narrative plays an important part in God of War too, of course, but it’s neither the only nor the most important one. Regardless of mythology, the franchise has always concerned itself above all else with spectacle, delivering action set pieces on a scale never seen before – in any medium. To this day, the opening sequence of God of War 3, in which Kratos and the Titans face off against Zeus’ pantheon as they climb up Mt. Olympus, remains the single most epic thing I have seen in my entire life. Nothing – not the Battle of Minas Tirith in The Return of the King, nor the fight against Thanos at the conclusion of Avengers: Endgame – comes close. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fanboying aside, I think any director would have a tough time capturing this epicness on camera. Not only because of financial restrictions – Moore is unlikely to receive a budget similar to James Cameron’s latest Avatar movie, let alone the $1 billion pumped into Prime’s own Rings of Power – but also because of limitations baked into the filmmaking medium itself. Though great at representing wars and battles with many moving pieces, live-action has long struggled to depict the kind of extended, stylized, one vs. one confrontations between superpowered individuals that animation (think Legend of Aang, Legend of Korra, One Piece, One-Punch Man) and video games (God of War, Devil May Cry, Black Myth: Wukong) excel at. Not even the recent Superman films, developed during an age when CGI can theoretically help directors achieve anything, have captured the kind of supernatural brawls demanded of Kratos' story.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/20/kratosbaldur1-1768921197382.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Can Prime Video make the epic Kratos vs. Baldur fight work in live-action?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Put differently: I think it’s impossible to film the fight between Kratos and Baldur (or Thor or Zeus or any other god) using live actors that goes as hard as it does in-game, which puts Moore and his team in a bit of a conundrum. They could scale the fight back, reducing the literally earth-shattering conflict into your run-of-the-mill Hollywood fistfight, though this would anger and alienate fans of the games who expect something just as – or almost as – impressive as what they experienced with a controller in their hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another, more efficient and effective but also ballsier option would be to treat Kratos’ unfathomable strength like the shark from Jaws: alluded to and talked about, but kept hidden from view except for a couple of brief moments. Instead of having the Kratos-Baldur fight play out like two cosplayers pretending to do what their characters do in the game, imagine following the events from Atreus’ perspective: hidden under the floorboards and feeling the ground shake once talking leads to punching. We wouldn’t see the fight itself, just its aftermath: the trees felled, the boulders shattered, that gigantic ravine that appeared from nowhere. This way, we’re left to imagine what transpired – and chances are, your imagination is better than anything the filmmakers could show us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, then, it just may be that the best possible adaptation of God of War would be one that keeps the visible action to a minimum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/can-we-stop-dunking-on-highguard-before-its-even-out-please</link>
            <guid>1411870</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">On December 11, 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> was revealed at The Game Awards. A PvP “raid shooter” from some of the creators behind Apex Legends and Titanfall, Highguard was admittedly somewhat of a surprise as the last reveal of Geoff Keighley’s show in December, which has typically been reserved for highly-anticipated, single-player games such as Naughty Dog’s next project, Intergalactic, or the next Mass Effect. Rather than a big-budget RPG, Highguard’s trailer displayed a multiplayer game rooted in a mix of fantasy and sci-fi, with SMG-wielding heroes riding horses into battle and magical spears hurled into grounded enemies by floating characters. “A new breed of shooter” flashed across the screen as its Overwatch-by-way-of-Concord action played out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The online reaction to this trailer has not been kind. Type “Highguard” into YouTube, and you’ll be almost exclusively met with videos headlined something along the lines of “This Game is Cooked”, “It’s Worse Than We Thought!”, and “What Happened?”. What’s happened is that it hasn’t even been released yet. And so I’m here to state what I thought would be obvious: we should actually play games before we definitively decide if they’re good or bad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I understand not being into the look of a game, but among the gaming community, it increasingly feels as if there’s now almost an underlying <em>need</em> for new releases to be bad if they’re not exactly what we want from one. I can’t help but feel this attitude is completely unhelpful in the long run, engineered with social media and ragebait content algorithms in mind rather than any kind of thoughtful analysis of what’s on show. Such willingness to dunk on a game for which we only have a single trailer and 10 screenshots displays a complete misunderstanding of (or intentional opposition to) “a rising tide lifts all boats” mentality when it comes to game development. More successful games are, ultimately, good for everyone, even if this specific one doesn’t meet your personal tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it isn’t just the gameplay fuelling this fire, but the relative lack of noise from developer Wildlight Entertainment following its reveal. More than a month later, this teaser remains the only video on the game’s official YouTube channel which, at the time of writing, still only has 1,610 subscribers — somewhat odd for a game that received such a prized reveal slot on gaming’s biggest night of the year (a slot that, notably, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/17/highguard-did-not-pay-for-its-infamous-game-awards-finale-slot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the studio did not pay for</a> – Geoff Keighley simply really liked the project a lot more than the wider gaming sphere seems to.) A similar situation can be seen on social media, where Highguard’s official X account is followed by just over 7,000 people and hasn’t posted since that December 12 announcement date. There are no details on characters, abilities, or maps. There’s not even an explanation of how this “new breed” of PvP works, which is unhelpful considering “raid shooter” is not a commonly recognised genre. Highguard itself may well not be bad, but the marketing promoting it certainly could be accused of being sub-par.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the development team is aiming to recapture lightning in a bottle and recreate the overwhelmingly successful shadow drop that Apex Legends benefited from. Perhaps, when it arrives, we’ll all be hooked – afterall, it’s directed by Chad Grenier, one of the original Call of Duty designers whose credits include the first two Modern Warfare games, both Titanfalls, and Apex Legends, and he’s joined by multiple other veterans of hugely successful games. But prior success is not a guaranteed key to victory, and yes, perhaps the final product will end up being underwhelming. But even knowing that, it's disheartening to see that this failure has already been presumed by many online; a predetermined fate, if you will. </p><p>It's this immediate and complete writing off of a game that irks me somewhat.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You may well feel that Highguard’s action doesn’t look like your cup of tea from the less than two minutes you’ve seen of it, and for all I know, once it launches on January 26, it may well struggle to find a substantial audience. But it's this immediate and complete writing off of a game that irks me somewhat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I realise I’m largely swimming against a tide of minds that have been made up here. We all know that, on the internet in 2026, it’s much easier to tear something down than reinforce it with optimism. But I can’t help but feel that many of the same people gleefully rubbing their hands together at what looks like another underwhelming game in their eyes, will be the same bemoaning the fact that the games industry is in a difficult spot where layoffs and studio closures seemingly happen on a weekly basis, putting the creatives they admire out of work. If no one is attempting to make new experiences and at least try to deliver on the promise of a “new breed of shooter”, then we’re in a grim place, indeed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking further ahead, Marathon will finally launch in March 2026. It’s been a rocky road for developer Bungie so far, with last year being full of beta tests that were met with little enthusiasm, and plagiarism allegations not helping the studio’s reputation at all. But to its credit, Bungie has been very quiet these last few months, working hard on a new version of the game that takes into account much of the feedback received from its burgeoning community. I, for one, am excited for it, despite not being overly interested in the extraction shooter genre. While many may already see (or, indeed, <em>want </em>to see) the writing on the wall amid hasty comparisons to Sony’s previous live-service shooter, Concord, I remain hopeful, largely due to believing in the shooter pedigree the Destiny developer is bringing to the project, much like the ex-Titanfall and Apex Legends team is carrying forward to Highguard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, I’m by no means convinced that either of these games will be blockbuster hits, nor guarantee that they’ll be amazing shooters in their own right, but I at least want to give them a chance. Because if we’re not getting excited about games, what are we even doing here? “Never judge a book by its cover” is an age-old phrase, but one that seems as pertinent as ever. Maybe in 2026, it should be updated to “Never judge a game by its initial teaser and lack of marketing beats running up to launch”. A mouthful, sure, but we’ll never discover the next great game if we’ve endeavoured to kill it before it even arrives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <p>The creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s R.E.A.L VR mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">which was taken down earlier this week following a DMCA strike by CD Projekt Red</a>, has stated that he's being punished by pirates sharing his mods online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">In a statement to IGN</a>, who reached out to creator Luke Ross asking he would consider making the Cyberpunk 2077 mod free, he responded by saying that it would take a considerable amount of work, and that he believed there was little point in doing so thanks to rampant piracy.</p>
<p>"I do not rule out releasing the mod free for everyone [...] but it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task. Also, the people who have voluntarily given their money to me in order to support my development efforts for the framework might not be happy about seeing the mod being given away all of a sudden to everyone just because I've been bullied into it."</p>

<p>Ross continued, stating: "Anyway, it's kind of become a moot point, because following to the unexpected DMCA strike, after the mod was forcibly removed from my Patreon, people afraid of losing VR support for their favorite games have started pirating and illegally exchanging the mod all over the Internet, brazenly saying that since I was not complying with CDPR's ToS, my work is now fair game and I should be punished by having it stolen. So in a sense CDPR already got what they wanted."</p><p>The mod itself wasn't the reason why Ross received an NDA, rather its availability behind a Patreon paywall behind several other R.E.A.L VR mods Ross has created over the years. This, according to CD Projekt Red, broke its 'fan guidelines' document, which prevents selling content derived from CD Projekt's works for money.</p>
<p>The company also stated, in a document shared by Ross, the following: "We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)"</p>
<p>Ross publicly pushed back against this, writing on his Patreon page: "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property".</p>

<figure data-uuid="b09d1b7326bff"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b09d1b7326bff/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After being announced for Switch 2 way back in the console's reveal Direct, we are now just days away from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>.</p>
<p>We're so close, in fact, that the reviews have started rolling in, and it's a pretty positive picture. Here at Nintendo Life, we had a wonderful time with FFVII, calling it "one of the best Switch 2 ports so far" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a brief snippet, followed by the whole thing, so you can read Alana's thoughts in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are caveats like 30fps, softer screen resolution, and some fuzzy textures. But Square Enix has clearly put the time and effort in here to ensure the best possible result, and with the Episode INTERMission DLC included as standard too, this might be the definitive way to play Remake on the go</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196050 @ 1769007614 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with thoughts on the latest Square Enix joint! Below, we have rounded up a handful of reviews from across the internet to try and give you a better idea of the full range of opinions on display. Spoilers, we were not alone in our admiration.</p>
<p>Right at the top of the pile is <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2/">CGMagazine</a>, where the outlet scored FFVII a 9.5/10 on Switch 2, praising how the title showcases the console's technical chops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’ve been holding off from playing <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> all this time because you don’t have a PS5 or gaming PC, the Switch 2 port is practically a must-play</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://rpgamer.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">RPGamer</a> came in with a 4.5/5 review, arguing that the title "fits wonderfully onto the Switch 2":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a huge amount to enjoy about the game, be it the exciting combat, impressive presentation, highly endearing cast, fascinating adjustments to the original tale, or detailed realisation of Midgar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Staying in the same camp, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/review/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">Comicbook.com</a> gave the game a 4.5/5, particularly calling out the "absolute bargain" price as a major pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em> remains $39.99 on the Switch 2 as it has been for PS5 and PC. And for the hours of solid action RPG combat it offers, that’s an absolute bargain in today’s market</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a> kept the good times going in its 4.5/5 review, praising the progression streamlining and Switch 2's HDR prowess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Fantasy Remake 7 Intergrade is one of the best-looking games on the Switch 2 to date, with an incredible port that compromises on very little to deliver a fantastic version of an already stunning game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, things dropped <em>ever so slightly</em> for <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Nintendo Insider</a>'s 8/10 review, which shared many of the positives outlined above, but still felt that the major story beats are a little lacking in this first part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can strongly recommend it, albeit with the caveat that you aren’t going to get any meaningful plot resolution within this part of the overall story. If you’re okay with that, then all I can say is… let’s mosey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All seems very consistent (and rather unsurprising), right? At the time of writing, the Switch 2 version is sitting with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a> score of 90 based on 24 reviews. We're sure more takes will roll in over the coming days, but for now, it seems, good game is still good.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade arrives on Switch 2 tomorrow, 22nd January 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arknights: Endfield Gets a 3X Performance Boost from DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Says NVIDIA]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfields-gets-3x-performance-boost-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With just a few hours left before the official launch of the game <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> announced that the PC version will include support for <strong>DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong>, as well as, of course, for all the linked technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>



<p>According to NVIDIA, owners of a <strong>GeForce RTX 50 Series</strong> graphics card can expect to see their frame rates boosted by an average of <strong>3X</strong> at <strong>4K</strong> with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation enabled (and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode). At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 MFG <strong>enables most GeForce RTX GPUs to reach the in-game maximum threshold of 480 frames per second</strong>, though that's not particularly surprising given that the game is also made for mobile devices (and PlayStation 5). With all this performance headroom, it should be a no-brainer for everyone to activate the <strong>second-generation DLSS Super Resolution Transformer model</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA unveiled at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> to obtain improved visual quality. For the time being, you'll have to do it via the NVIDIA app, though native in-game support is also in development by Arknights: Endfield developer <strong>HYPERGRYPH</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game is a <strong>free-to-play action RPG</strong> with some simulation features thrown in for good measure. You can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's hands-on preview and bonus developer interview here</a>, while the system requirements are available below. The PC version isn't on Steam, by the way; you can only download the game via the official website's launcher or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arknightsendfield-f0f167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Arknights: Endfield Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS Version</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-9400F or equivalent</td><td>Intel Core i7-10700K or equivalent or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16 GB</td><td>16 GB or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or equivalent</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 or equivalent or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>DirectX 11</td><td>DirectX 11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>50 GB free space (+ 40 GB for unpacking)</td><td>SSD Recommended, 50 GB free space (+ 40 GB for unpacking)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Beyond the Arknights: Endfield news, NVIDIA also shared that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Styx: Blades of Greed</a></strong> supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, too, both in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC demo that's currently out</a> and in the full game, due on February 19. Once again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</a> can be enabled through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Moon Studios will release the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> co-op update</a>. The game already natively supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and now players can also upgrade to the second-gen Transformer model (DLSS 4.5) through the NVIDIA app for enhanced fidelity, especially when using the Performance and Ultra Performance modes.</p>



<p>Lastly, the indie open world co-op survival game <strong>The Gold River Project</strong>, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will be released with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, with the option to enable DLSS 4.5 in the NVIDIA app.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/864630/tr49-review-steam-iphone</link>
            <guid>1411840</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re living in a pretty great time for detective games. Over the last few years, developers have been experimenting with all kinds of different ways of turning the act of investigation into a compelling game, which has led to the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8837815/her-story"><em>Her Story</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17993710/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-lucas-pope-pc-mac"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile">the <em>Golden Idol</em> series</a>, to name just a few. Now you can add TR-49 to that list — a game that builds on the genre by introducing a bizarre code-breaking computer.</p><p>Developed by Inkle, the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5954611/inkle-80-days-ios-game"><em>80 Days</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18507503/heavens-vault-review-ps4-pc"><em>Heaven’s Vault</em></a>, <em>TR-49</em> is confounding from its very first moments. When you start the game you have no idea what’s going on — and neither does your character. You play as a woman who wakes up inside of a church basement with no memory of who she is or how she got down there. In front of you is a strange WWII-era computer. It has a big circular screen and you control it by using the kind of lever more closely associated with factory machinery than high-end computing. Soon, you hear the voice of a man who tells you what you need to do: find a missing book.</p><p>To tell you much more about the premise would be to spoil the <em>1984</em>-esque dystopia that unravels; not that my description would make much sense anyway. <em>TR-49</em> is a game where discovering the narrative is woven directly into the gameplay. The machine is the only thing you can interact with, and it’s a device packed with information, but the trick is finding it. Each file has an associated code which you have to input to open it. The idea is that by reading through the various files you uncover, you’ll learn new information, which will in turn help you learn new codes for more files.</p><p>I found myself poring over documents I didn’t really understand at first, seeking out names and dates that could be relevant, and then trying my luck coming up with a code. You also don’t really need to carry around a notebook as the game keeps track of important people, organizations, and books through a file system you can reference at any point.</p><p>Playing <em>TR-49 </em>reminded me a lot of <em>Her Story</em>, a game you interact with by searching for keywords in a police database. In this case, a story starts to reveal itself the more you read and start to piece things together. But there’s another side to <em>TR-49</em>, as it’s also part audio drama. While your character is alone down in the basement, you have a radio that lets you communicate with a man on the outside. It’s mostly one way, as the radio will light up when it’s time to talk. He gives you directions, answers questions, and occasionally gives subtle hints when you’re stuck.</p><p>It’s a well-acted drama, and this structure makes the big revelations feel a lot more important than just opening a new file on an ancient computer. It adds a real sense of urgency to a game that is otherwise just inputting numbers. And there’s something very organic and satisfying in the way you reveal the scope of the story bit by bit. It feels almost like you’re uncovering things, rather than them simply being told to you.</p><p>And while most of this unfolds naturally, <em>TR-49</em> does suffer from the same problem as most games in the genre: there’s a good chance you’re going to get stuck. I certainly did. Usually, I just had to take a break and re-read something with fresh eyes, and the clues would jump out at me on a second look. But I also resorted to guesswork a few times, plugging in codes that seemed maybe right, and then hoping for the best. I’m not ashamed to say this typically worked. It helps that it’s a fairly tactile experience, at least on mobile where you rotate dials and pull knobs, so there’s satisfaction in simply using the machine, even if you’re guessing.</p><p>Those roadblocks can be frustrating, but at least in my experience I always found a way to get past them, whether it was taking a breath or taking a guess. Either way, <em>TR-49 </em>managed to do what all the best detective games do: make me feel like I was part of the story, piecing it together as I progressed. You just have to be willing to be bewildered before it all pays off.</p><p><sub>TR-49 <em>launches January 21st on Steam and iOS.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/864630/tr49-review-steam-iphone]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Restocks Its 15.6″ Portable Gaming Monitor at an All-Time Low and Already Close to Selling Out Again]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-restocks-its-15-6-portable-gaming-monitor-at-an-all-time-low-and-already-close-to-selling-out-again-2000661448</link>
            <guid>1411837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A multi-monitor setup can significantly boost your productivity, whether you’re working on a creative task, a work deadline, or a passion project. While most secondary monitors are often bulky, there are quite a few portable options around that let you hit all your goals on the go.</p>
<p>One such option is the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor, which is designed to work with a range of devices, from laptops to PC, MacBooks, phones, and even consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">It usually goes for around $100 at Amazon, but it’s currently available in grey for just $66 at the retailer. That’s after a limited time, 34% discount</a>. Grab it before the offer expires or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Viewing Modes</h2>
<p>What’s the picture your mind paints when you think of a dual-monitor workstation? It likely involves big screens taking over your entire desk. This portable monitor does the opposite by offering you extra screen space without the usual clutter. You’re getting a high-quality 15.6-inch advanced IPS screen that delivers a stunning 1920 x 1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals. HDR support offers exceptional color accuracy, while blue light reduction technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes, especially during those long work sessions.</p>
<p>You’ll appreciate the 178-degree viewing angle that keeps the visuals consistent from nearly every position. This means you don’t exactly have to sit right in front of the screen to see what’s going on, which makes the monitor great for sharing with multiple people at the same time. As for the screen size, it’s almost similar to what most standard laptops offer these days. You will be able to stream, work, and play comfortably without feeling cramped. Additionally, the monitor can be used in both landscape and portrait modes. The former is ideal for browsing, watching videos, and gaming, while the latter can be used for reading long documents and even going through social media feeds. Viewing modes include duplicating and extending your main screen.</p>



<p>The KYY portable monitor comes equipped with two fully-functional Type-C ports and a mini HDMI port. It’s made to work with a range of devices (tablets, laptops, consoles, PC), as long as they support Thunderbolt 3 or 3.1 USB-Type-C. There are two built-in speakers, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio as well, so you won’t need to rely on external options with this one.</p>
<p>Durability comes from the attached scratch-proof smart cover that’s made of strong PU leather exterior. It doubles as a stand, so you can use it to prop the monitor anywhere you like. The two grooves in the cover let you adjust the viewing angle, too. Maybe use it upright when you’re working on an important task on your desk, and then tilt it back into a more relaxed position for streaming later at night!</p>
<p>At just 1.7lbs and 0.3 inches slim, the monitor is easy to carry on the go. It can easily slip into your laptop bag and won’t add unnecessary bulk to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">To wrap it up, this portable monitor is great for anyone looking to enjoy additional screen space and be more productive. It’s now down to just $66, which is nothing considering the convenience it offers.</a></p>

<p>A new multiplayer mod for The Witcher 3, called ‘Witcher Online’, lets players complete the entire campaign with their friends. </p>



<p>There appears to be a lot happening with the Witcher franchise. Reports suggest that a new DLC is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to arrive by May 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment is also in development</a>. However, it seems we have a long wait ahead before these releases become available. In the meantime, players can explore a mod that significantly enhances the original game’s replayability. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> who spawn into maps late actually tend to profit more economically, according to a recent interview with design lead Virgil Watkins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/">Published by GamesRadar</a>, the matter on delayed spawns was addressed head on, as well as whether or not it's good for the players who find themselves a bit late to the party. It turns out, based on the data Embark Studios can see, these players actually tend to extract with more cash in their pockets.</p>
<p>"But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, 'The loot's all gone,' or whatever else. But players who late join economically profit way more than people who aren't," Watkins said. "The session, when they are fresh, does eventually get quieter, and very often they come across the remnants of fights or can maybe take out bigger drones or hit high-ticket areas more readily than other players. So that's been a very interesting thing to look at."</p>

<figure>

</figure>


<p>Watkins elaborated, stating that the purpose of late spawns was to make sure that maps weren't largely barren of players after around 10 minutes, keeping games fresh throughout the entirety of the game. The team had hoped that players entering a match late would be happy to pivot to alternative goals if they didn't have time to achieve what they initially wanted.</p><p>However, in limited-time events or locked rooms, Embark does acknowledge that a genuine sense of frustration is present. Watkins would confirm that the matter of late spawns is being looked into, to try and find a balance between keeping maps populated and removing that feeling of missing out on stuff at no fault of your own.</p>
<p>"With things like trials, where that is the only objective, then fine, that's kind of off the table and that really sucks, because that was the time you had set aside for it. I think trying to do more on that side of things is where I want to look next. Coming in with a dedicated purpose and that's been undercut by the late join is where I'd want to remove the pain point first."</p>

Now, YouTuber Aaron Christophel has added one more item to the list of <em>Doom</em>-compatible appliances: a pressure cooker.</p><p>As spotted by the good folks at <a href="https://retrododo.com/modder-gets-doom-running-on-a-pressure-cooker/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Retrododo</a>, Christophel posted a video explaining how to "hack" the Krups Cook4Me pressure cooker in order to enable it to run a ROM of the original <em>Doom</em>. Do note that we're talking about the 1993 game here, not <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6653da9e-4b23-41d4-a815-ae67196955eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the 2016 reboot</a>.</p><p>It turns out that running <em>Doom </em>on the Cook4Me is actually relatively easy. Opening up the device reveals that it has a Wi-Fi module inside, as well as around 128MB of RAM and Flash memory. That's more than enough to get things cooking.</p><figure role="group">

<p>I won't go into the technical details (you can watch Christophel's video for that!), but he uploads the ROM to the smart cooker's board, puts the machine back together, and within moments, he's slaying demons on the Cook4Me's tiny screen.</p><p>This is probably one of those situations wherein it's more impressive to watch <em>Doom </em>running on a pressure cooker than it actually is to play the thing. I'd imagine it's pretty cumbersome to try and navigate the game's labyrinthine levels using controls that just were not designed for that purpose.</p><p>Still, it's pretty cool to see id Software's contribution to gaming history still being honored (if that's the right word) by spreading its gospel to all devices and sundry.</p><p>You can check out Aaron Christophel's video to see how he managed to get <em>Doom </em>running on a pressure cooker right here. It's well worth a watch.</p>
<p>The Krups Cook4Me is far from the only place <em>Doom </em>is able to run (outside of the places it's meant to run, of course). The game has also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-notepad-is-now-thing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="615fd2d5-c7a1-4259-a8c0-3f30da3df802" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">modded into Windows Notepad</a> and ported to devices like fitness bands, oscilloscopes, and printers.</p><p>Of course, the <em>Doom </em>franchise is still alive and well, with last year's <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>ripping and tearing across PC and consoles (and getting itself a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad90df29-2a6c-48a6-9ef5-b0c7c81e1bd9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Chelsea Flower Show installation</a> into the bargain).

            <guid>1411780</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO is a liquid-cooling solution that combines a 360 mm radiator with 3 Matte Black Fans and a ProArt aesthetic for systems that require style and thermal management. It’s designed as a fully-integrated liquid-cooling system for use with either an Intel LGA 1700, 1200, or 115X socketed system, or an AMD AM4 or AM5 socketed system, giving you the flexibility to easily move the cooling system from one socketed system to another. On the pump housing is an illuminated Status Meter that provides a quick view of the current system load, temperature, and fan speed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/">You can purchase the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System for $230 at Amazon, saving $60 and 21% off its regular retail price of $290.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An efficient and aesthetically pleasing way to cool your PC</h2>
<p>With the 360mm radiator on the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System, you have a much larger heat-dissipation area under high-load conditions. The radiator is approximately 15.5″ long and has a narrow profile to accommodate many mid-tower and larger cases that can accept a triple-fan radiator. In addition to the radiator, the overall design of the cooler is intended to provide a clean build experience, with the hardware taking center stage and not overwhelming the build with light effects.</p>
<p>The included AlphaCool Apex Stealth Metal Power fans are matte-black, capable of both airflow and pressure, which is important for pushing air through densely packed radiator fins. These fans can operate up to 3000 RPM, and your motherboard may control the fan speed to optimize performance versus noise level to meet your needs. The fans are daisy-chained together to simplify cable routing, allowing you to connect multiple fans and run a single set of cables to them; this can help declutter the interior of your case after everything is wired.</p>



<p>The pump uses a 3-phase electric motor that delivers adequate coolant flow while operating more quietly than simpler designs. When combined with the 450mm of tubing provided, you can route the tubes to the top or front of supported cases without stressing the fittings. The tubes themselves utilize a braided mesh sleeve to improve durability and create a more finished appearance. Together, these features aim to provide smooth coolant flow to your processor, even during heavy workloads.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the ProArt LC 360 AIO is to provide a balanced build experience, pairing a subtle ProArt aesthetic with higher-end cooling hardware. In addition to the 360mm radiator, the system includes metal-bodied fans, an illuminated status meter, and supports a wide array of socket types. If you’re building a PC that requires a clean build, quiet operation, and no flashing lights, the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System could be an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/">At $230 on sale, down from its typical $290, you receive premium-quality components at a lower cost than you would if you invested in a more elaborate custom loop.</a></p>

<p>A reliable insider has reaffirmed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will release for Xbox in 2026. </p>



<p>For those unaware, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-will-release-for-xbox-and-switch-2-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>, it was claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth would release for Xbox and the Switch 2 in 2026. We have yet to receive any official confirmation from either Xbox or Square Enix, but the insider seems confident it will release this year. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-for-xbox-is-coming-this-year">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for Xbox is Coming this Year</h2>



<p>The insider who has reaffirmed the release for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Xbox is none other than NateTheHate. Interestingly, the reconfirmation comes via the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013705307499712834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), where he thanked the community for dubbing him r/GamingLeaksAndRumour’s Leaker of the Year. </p>



<p>In one of the comments, NateTheHate was asked whether the plans for Rebirth coming to Xbox in 2026 are still the same, to which he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013710238508077359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, “Yes.” NateTheHate also stated that leaking something about Half-Life 3 is something he will “try to achieve” this year. And, there’s a chance that we might get some new leaks on his next podcast. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake has already released for both Xbox consoles and the Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and hopefully, the port for FF7 Rebirth should be next on the list. At the moment, all we can do is wait for an official confirmation, but we do know the entire trilogy is making its way to Switch 2; it is just a matter of when now. </p>







<p>In other news, the director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the FF6 Remake series should be led by someone else</a>. Additionally, the game experience for the third instalment in the FF7 Remake series is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“. When do you think Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be officially announced for Xbox and Switch 2 in 2026?
