Although they don’t contain a physical copy of a game, Nintendo’s Tetsuya Sasaki <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">explained to <em>GameSpot</em></a> that game-key cards aren’t permanently tied to a specific Nintendo account. The games can be inserted and played on any Switch 2 console, allowing them to be borrowed, rented, and even resold.</p><p>“So key cards will start up on the console or system that it is slotted into, so it’s not tied to an account or anything,” said Sasaki.</p><p>That behavior is different from the Switch games that Nintendo currently sells in retail locations, which feature a download code instead of a physical cartridge. Those codes can only be used a single time and are connected to a specific Nintendo account, preventing them from being resold at a later date.</p><p>Game-key cards automatically trigger a game download when inserted into a Switch 2 console. Once the game is downloaded and installed, an internet connection “...is only required when you launch the game for the first time,” <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415">according to a support page on Nintendo’s website</a>. After that initial launch check the game can be played without an internet connection, as long as the game-key cartridge is still inserted into the console.</p><p>The game-key cards are an unusual format that merges digital game downloads and physical cartridges without quite solving the downsides of either format. Internet access is still required to download the games, and you still need the cartridges to play them. But as Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">Doug Bowser explained to <em>The Verge</em></a>, the game-key cards primarily benefit publishers, allowing them to sell physical copies of games at retail locations that may <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-max-cartridge-size/#:~:text=Switch%202%20Max%20Cartridge%20Size%20is%2064%20GB&amp;text=This%20is%20much%20larger%20than,and%2010%20GB%20sizes%2C%20respectively.">exceed the 64GB capacity of regular Switch 2 game cartridges</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a folklore-laden story that’s equally heartwarming and heartbreaking, as well as simple yet enjoyable gameplay, there’s an awful lot to love about this romp through the Deep South. If that sounds like your kind of thing, here are a few things to know before diving into <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h3977"><a id=""></a>You’re rewarded for veering off the beaten path</h2><figure id="" data-id="448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-recommend-id="image://448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-recommend-id="image://448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is a very linear experience, so you won’t encounter any open-world environments or large-scale level design during the campaign. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t any side paths and secret locations to uncover. As a matter of fact, <strong>you can find things hidden all across this bayou adventure’s levels</strong>—if you take the time to look around, that is.</p><p>Most notably, <strong>exploration is rewarded with health upgrades and Floofs, the latter of which is <em>South of Midnight</em>’s form of experience points</strong>. You’ll find tons of these all over the place, but most of them will require you to take a detour from the main path in some way. Since they’re required for leveling up your skills, you should <strong>take the time to thoroughly explore locations so you can stock up on as many as possible</strong>.</p><p>In addition to health upgrades and Floofs, you can find some of the game’s readables (collectibles) and world-building moments hidden away in unexpected places in <em>South of Midnight</em>, too. And if you’re aiming to fully complete the game, you’ll want to take the extra time to find these and fill out your collection.</p><h2 id="h3978"><a id=""></a>Crouton is a huge help in fights</h2><figure id="" data-id="28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-recommend-id="image://28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-recommend-id="image://28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hazel’s little stuffed buddy, Crouton, may not look very tough, but he’s no slouch in battle. He can be thrown into an enemy to briefly take control of them, giving you a temporary ally that can beat the hell out of your attackers for you. If you prioritize control of tougher enemies, you can take them out of the fight for a bit so you can work on the lower-tier foes. When Crouton’s control wears off, you’ll be in a much better position for tackling those big bads. </p><p>It’s a good idea to <strong>invest some skill points into Crouton Detonation and Crouton Surge</strong> as soon as they become available to further improve Crouton’s effectiveness with an AOE (Area of Effect) blast and higher overall damage, respectively.

<p>Nintendo's barrage of Switch announcements over the last two weeks have also come with changes to the way Nintendo treats physical and digital copies of games.</p>
<p>Digital games can now become "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">virtual game cards</a>," facilitating slightly more flexible sharing of digitally purchased games between multiple Switch systems owned by the same person or family of people. And physical copies of games can now be either traditional game cards—little bits of plastic with the game stored on a flash memory chip inside—or "Game-Key cards," which look the same from the outside but don't actually have any game data stored on them.</p>
<p>A Game-Key card has a "key" stored on it that prompts a download of the game data from Nintendo's servers the first time you insert it. From then on, the game behaves like a cross between a digital download and a physical game—all of the game's content has to be on the console's internal storage or a microSD Express card, but you <em>need</em> to have the Game-Key card inserted before the game will launch.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> the same as the download code printed on a digital game card, which can't be used again once it's been claimed—as explained on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-Game-Key-Cards-2785635.html">a Nintendo support page</a>, a Game-Key card will work the same way in any other Switch once the game data has been downloaded. It's not tied to any particular Nintendo Account, as a digital-only game download is.</p>
<p>In that way, a Game-Key card is a bit like playing certain DRM-protected PC games in the days before Steam or installing a disc-based PlayStation or Xbox game to local storage. The game isn't actively loading any content from the physical media but is instead using the physical media to confirm that you own the game you're trying to play.</p>
<h2>Game-Key cards aren’t ideal</h2>

<p>People on the Internet have gotten mad about Game-Key cards, just like people on the Internet have gotten mad about many aspects of the Switch 2 launch ($70-to-$80 games, relatively few brand-new first-party launch games, a $449 base price that may end up getting raised <em>again</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">because of Donald Trump's disruptive and unpredictable tariff program</a>).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And there are real concerns and annoyances that will come with Game-Key cards. Normally, the physical copy of a game is playable right out of the box—or, at most, after downloading patches that are a fraction of the size of the entire game. This saves time, and it saves internal storage space. That'll be particularly important if you're trying to stretch the console's 256GB of internal storage and avoid buying a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">new microSD Express card</a>.</p>
<p>Now, every time you put the game into a new console, you have to download the whole game again. That's true if you have multiple Switches in your family, or if you're passing the card to a friend to play, or if you delete the game to make room for a new one. And you lose the it-just-launches flexibility of downloadable titles since you need to insert a game key card to be allowed to play the game you've downloaded.</p>
<p>And then there's the (very) long-term argument. In 2023, Nintendo shut down the online servers for its Wii U and 3DS consoles. At that point, it had been years since either console had seen a new game, and it's almost certain that the vast majority of them are spending most of their time gathering dust or tucked into a drawer. But for game preservationists, it meant that a whole lot was breaking: online play for either system, game update distribution for either system, and downloadable games and DLC for either system.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical future where the Switch servers are also shut down, a "real" game card is still a playable game. A Game-Key card becomes a hunk of plastic.</p>

<h2>... but I prefer this to the alternative</h2>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>But let's be honest with ourselves. Physical game releases have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">dying out gradually for years</a>, a product of the natural evolution of technology and the fact that it costs more to manufacture and ship a physical object than it does to provide server bandwidth for a game download.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>At this point, game companies probably aren't choosing between shipping either a regular-old game card or a Game-Key card—they're likely deciding whether to ship a Game-Key card or <em>nothing</em>. Digital-only has become the default model for most independently developed games and smaller releases from big publishers. When some of those games get physical releases at all, it's handled through a specialty retailer like <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/">Limited Run Games</a>, which will package up a small handful of them to satisfy physical game dead-enders.</p>
<p>I count myself as a member of that group, by the way, partly because I like having Things To Look At On A Shelf. But mostly because a game cartridge is a useful object to me in a way that a downloaded game is not. I can pass a game card to a friend so they can see if their kids like the game without having to spend money on it first. I can go halvsies with a friend on a game we both want to play but don't want to pay $60 for. I can sell a game card when I'm done with it for some portion of its original value—and occasionally, for particularly rare out-of-print games, for significantly more than I paid for it in the first place.</p>
<p>This is called "sharing things," and it's how owning stuff has worked for as long as people have owned stuff. I can lend or borrow a book; I can lend or borrow a tool; I can lend or borrow a phone charger. But it's something that's being steadily eroded in the streaming and digital download age, when companies and a certain kind of Internet commenter/social media poster will pedantically explain to you that you are not buying a <em>thing</em>, you are buying a&nbsp;<em>license to view or use a thing</em>.</p>
<p>The main reason I stick with physical games is because that sucks! That's a bad arrangement!</p>
<p>A Game-Key card, for all its weird faults and inconveniences, still manages to clear that bar for me. It's not a non-transferable title tied to my Nintendo account for all time, restricted to whatever sharing mechanism Nintendo decides I can use. It is still a thing to be looked at and a transferrable physical object that retains inherent value in a way that a downloadable game does not. I would prefer "real" game cards, and I don't love the market forces that gave rise to the Game-Key card idea. But I can still work with this.</p>

Last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> reveal might have had its exciting bits but it also brought its share of controversy too. There was the cost of the console itself, the cost of its games, or the perhaps surprising decision to charge owners for Switch 2's Welcome Tour tutorial game instead of including it for free - a decision <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>'s Bill Trinen has now addressed, saying the newly confirmed $10 USD price reflects the "amount of care and work" put into it.
</p>
<p>
Welcome Tour was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">unveiled during last week's Switch 2 reveal</a>, and is described as an "interactive exhibit" offering "lots of insights about the console" through "tech demos, minigames and other interactions". As presented during Nintendo's showcase, however, it looked very much a tutorial, walking players through the fundamental features of their new console purchase - so it came as something as a surprise when Nintendo revealed it wasn't a free pack-in (unlike, say, PS5's similar Astro's Playroom) but a paid digital purchase.
</p>
<p>
Now, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in">speaking to IGN</a>, Nintendo of America's vice president of product and player experience, Bill Trinen, has confirmed exactly how much Welcome Tour will cost, saying its newly announced $9.99 USD price tag "is not an exorbitant" one. As to why Nintendo has opted to charge Switch 2 owners extra to learn how to use their £396 console, Trinen described Welcome Tour as an "interesting product" that's more than a "quick intro" to Switch 2.

"It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there," he explained. "I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does. And for that reason, and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'"
</p>
<p>
Value has been on everyone's mind following Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">console's £396/$450 price tag having already seen pushback from fans</a>. There've been similar cost concerns around the $80 USD price of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - which Nintendo of American boss Doug Bowser has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">since insisted reflects the "breadth and depth of the gameplay"</a> - even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">price of its paid Switch 2 Edition upgrades</a>. That doesn't appear to have dissuaded punters from pre-ordering the console, however, with Switch 2 already sold out at many retailers. Nintendo's official pre-order schemed launches this Thursday, 10th April, for most of the world - apart from in the US, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">pre-orders have been delayed indefinitely</a> due to last week's Trump tariffs.
</p>
<p>
As for Switch 2 itself, Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">went hands-on last week</a>, calling it a "proper generational upgrade", and describing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World as its "killer app"</a>.

			<p>Most Nintendo franchises are very carefully curated, slowly introducing new characters and elements, while maintaining nostalgic ties to the past. Oddly, the exception to this rule is Nintendo’s very first big franchise, Donkey Kong, which the company seems happy to reboot whenever it suits their fancy. The original Donkey Kong games gave way to Rare’s Donkey Kong Country in the 90s, we got another soft reboot when Retro Studios took over the series and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced the Kremlings with tiki masks</a>, and now, Nintendo’s reinventing the whole shebang again. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> gives Nintendo’s big ape a major makeover, turning DK into a terrain-smashing brute who can literally shape the world around him with his fists.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is a bold new take, but it's one Nintendo clearly has quite a bit of confidence in, given the game is essentially standing in for a new Mario platformer during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch window. Will DK's latest reinvention be a success or leave fans pounding the ground in disappointment? I recently had the chance to go paws-on with Donkey Kong Bananza at a Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here are my general thoughts on the new hardware</a>) and you can jump on down for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After many years of mostly chilling in his treehouse, Donkey Kong has seemingly decided to make something of himself, becoming a miner who uses his fists to dig up Golden Bananas and a glittering ore named “Banandium” (naturally). Unfortunately, a villainous crew of apes, known as VoidCo, crashes a meteor into DK’s mine on Ingot Island, sinking all its precious treasure further underground. This sets DK off on a quest through multiple descending levels to crack some heads and retrieve as many Golden Bananas as he can.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first thing you’ll likely note upon jumping into Donkey Kong Bananza are the changes to DK himself, who has been redesigned to look a lot like he did in The Super Mario Bros. Movie (minus the Seth Rogen voice, thankfully). While there have been some knee-jerk negative reactions to the new look, only a few minutes with the game will likely dispel any misgivings you might have. Frankly, the old Rare DK design was showing its age and this new look allows for a much wider range of expressions, which the developers of DK Bananza (likely the EPD Tokyo team behind Super Mario Odyssey) take full advantage of. This Donkey Kong feels like a more fleshed-out character with a full range of emotions rather than just a dumb animal. You even get to play dress-up, as fossils you collect can be traded for new looks at a not-yet-glimpsed cosmetics store.</p>
<p>Some of the changes to Donkey Kong’s world feel a bit odd at first, like all the apes that look kind of like Diddy Kong (but aren’t Diddy Kong) running around and the strange assortment of enemies. But odd isn’t necessarily bad, and much like with DK’s makeover, that feeling of “this is weird” wore off quickly. Also, during a second playthrough of the Donkey Kong Bananza demo, in which I focused on finding as many secrets as I could, I managed to locate good old Cranky Kong. This, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combined with an accidental leak from Nintendo themselves</a>, hints DK Bananza may not be quite as hard a reboot as it appears at first.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of visuals, Donkey Kong Bananza goes for a unique, stylized look. For instance, the fuzzy fur shading that’s adorned DK for years has been replaced with almost scale-like layers of fur. Similarly, the world of DK Bananza features a lot of intentionally off-kilter, sharp angles and brash colors. This isn’t the most cohesive visual style Nintendo has ever come up with, but everything has a nice, sharp, bold look that makes this world stand out on the new Switch 2 hardware. Meanwhile, the game runs at a nice, mostly-smooth 60fps, with only a few brief hiccups detected.</p>
<p>As for how Donkey Kong Bananza plays, the game’s central gimmick becomes apparent very quickly – this time around, DK doesn’t just smash baddies with his fists, he can now use them to plow into the terrain, with a surprising amount of the environment being destructible. DK can punch forward, downward, and up, as well as slam down from above after a jump. Additionally, he can grab chunks of rock and dirt to throw and clamber up pretty much any vertical surface.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's a simple, yet versatile, set of tools for traversing and shaping the world, which makes Donkey Kong Bananza almost feel like a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. The Mario Odyssey roots are clear, with the stage I explored having both explicitly stated missions to achieve and extra Golden Bananas hidden all over for those who choose to (literally) dig a bit deeper. While the actual platforming in the level I played was very rudimentary, there are bonus stages to uncover that provide more traditional “run, jump, and fight” challenges. The demo even culminated in a basic boss battle of sorts.</p>
<p>And yet, as mentioned, Donkey Kong Bananza also seems to embody some of that Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom “go crazy, do things your way” ethos. Do you want to stick to the golden path? Search carefully for secrets? Or just lay waste to everything around you? It’s up to each individual player. There were also some simple puzzle elements found in the demo, in the form of small concrete sections of the environment that could be destroyed by throwing explosive materials at them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFdonkeykongbananza6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like Tears of the Kingdom, there were also moments when the amount of freedom Donkey Kong Bananza allows made the game feel a bit messy. At times, I'd find myself digging into the ground when I simply wanted to attack an enemy, and once burrowed in there, the camera sometimes made it tough to keep track of where I was. There was also an odd issue where turning the camera would sometimes make most of the world disappear into a purple void for a second, which I assume will be fixed before launch.</p>
<p>While the issues I just mentioned caused some momentary frustration, I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</p>

<h2>Current Thoughts on Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza swings the franchise in a bold direction, giving the ape himself a personality-packed makeover and offering up gameplay that combines the sandbox platforming formula of Super Mario Odyssey with the open-ended, play-as-you-will ethos of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While the demo I played was a bit rough around the edges in some respects, DK Bananza promises to potentially be an amalgamation of some of Nintendo’s most acclaimed games of recent years. We don’t know for sure if that will be the case yet, but I’m eager to unpeel the full package and find out.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17. Look for more Wccftech coverage of the game closer to launch.</p>

Instead, it spotlights race, slavery, poverty, generational trauma, and death. Because of its rich, complex, often painful history, the South has developed a unique, beautiful folkloric tapestry of tall tales, heroes, and monsters. And <em>South of Midnight </em>literally lets you weave and unweave this tapestry via a 12-13 hour single-player adventure through its mystical but grounded spin on the American South.</p><p>In <em>South of Midnight</em>, you play as a young Black woman named Hazel Flood. She’s a talented athlete who has a mother consumed with helping abused kids. While this causes some drama between the two, she still cares greatly for her mother. So when a hurricane washes their trailer away down the river, Hazel chases after it and finds herself in a strange and magical version of the South, complete with nasty ghost monsters called haints, who linger in our world after someone has suffered greatly.</p><p>Thankfully, very early on in the game, you discover that Hazel is special. She’s a Weaver, a person who can see the threads of reality and can weave space and time using magical artifacts like sewing needles. The last Weaver to exist was a former slave woman who helped other slaves escape their masters and find freedom. Throughout the game, Hazel learns more about her powers and her connection to the world via this woman and her journey to help a single family escape slavery.</p><p>Of course, this is a video game, so Hazel’s newfound weaving powers allow her to kick ass, double jump, and solve puzzles, too. Sadly, this is where <em>South of Midnight </em>unravels a bit. </p><p>The combat in the game always happens in locked-off arena-like spaces where enemies spawn for a while until you defeat them all and can “pop” a cursed bit of the world and free yourself from the encounter. You do this a lot in <em>South of Midnight</em>, and it gets repetitive quickly, partly because every fight feels the same and also because the combat is serviceable but not much more than that. You can dodge, you can charge some attacks, and you have a stun and some upgrades. If you’ve played a video game in the last decade, none of this will be terribly exciting or feel unique at all. It’s not bad, per se, just stale and easily the weakest part of <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><p>Hazel’s Weaver abilities are more fun to use when you’re platforming and solving puzzles, and I wish there was more of that in the game and less of the 100+ arenas you have to fight through to reach the end, which is a big combat arena that left a sour taste in my mouth.</p><p>Here’s the thing, though: In the end, I don’t really care that the combat is just so-so and serviceable. That’s because everything else in this game is so good that I can overlook some boring punchy bits.</p><p>The world of <em>South of Midnight</em> is gorgeous. The stop-motion-like animations of characters and critters help sell the painted, hand-crafted feel of every level in the game. Each location in <em>South of Midnight</em> is meticulously detailed and covered in little touches—like animals off in the distance or screaming cicadas—that help immerse you in the game’s lively, stylized slice of the deep South. And it’s not all swamps.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em>’s locales are greatly varied, offering disgusting places like a town flooded with pig shit-filled water and cool forests dotted with abandoned company towns and slave quarters. And throughout your journey, incredible lighting makes every area distinct, from sun-drenched levels that feel hot and muggy to spooky swamps that feel claustrophobic and dark. I spent a lot of time in <em>South of Midnight</em>, stopping and taking screenshots of every level. And I expect I’m not alone.</p><p>Another key part of <em>South of Midnight</em>’s charm is its wonderful and very Southern music. Many levels in the game feature songs with lyrics directly related to the mythical or supernatural entity or creature you are dealing with, all of them based on real Southern folklore. </p><figure id="" data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some songs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like a twangy Dolly Parton-esque diddy about a massive gator named Two-Toed Tom</a></span>, stuck with me for days after playing the game. These songs run the gamut from country to blues to jazz and feature banjos, acoustic guitars, lyrics about heaven and hell, and folk singers belting out sometimes depressing allegories about the past. It’s unlike any video game soundtrack I’ve heard this year, and it will stay with me long after I move on to other games.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is going to be a game that I predict some people will bounce off of after just a few hours. A big reason will be that the combat isn’t anything to write home about. And the first few levels, while gorgeous and filled with great tunes, aren’t as exciting as what follows after the game gives you more abilities, like a double jump. </p><p>But if you can push through some of those issues, what you’ll discover is a wonderful and heartfelt adventure through American history and Southern folklore that is unlike any game I’ve played. Like the South itself, <em>South of Midnight</em> is a messy, complicated, but often beautiful and passionate thing worth experiencing. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <div><p>This past weekend, the Kickstarter campaign for <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> concluded. The campaign for this fantasy TTRPG, based on Balkan and Slavic folklore, was funded within 20 minutes of going life and ended with more than 10 times its goal.</p>



<p>According to its official campaign page, Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch is a TTRPG supplement heavily inspired by grim tales from Balkan and Slavic folklore. It's a supplement compatible with the current edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and Son of Oak's hotly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legend in the Mist</em></a> system.</p>

The material includes new character options, locals, eerie magic items, spells, and monsters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the books contained detailed information on the land of Zamanora as well as prewritten adventure. In keeping with the grim tone, the books include new rules for vampirism, lycanthropy, and debilitating curses.</p>

<p>This culture influence extends to unique gameplay mechanics. Players can abjure evil spirits as a Kuker or hunt down terrors of the knight as a Krsnic. Imbue poppets with magical power or perform communal ceremonies to cast powerful spells. There's even a system tracking the creeping influence of the Hidden World on the real world, an influence that affects mind and body.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers of <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> Kickstarter campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital PDFs for $44:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $53:</strong> Digital and Physical copy of the Core Book</li>
	<li><strong>All Digital for $83:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables, Digital Assets and Tokens for VTTs, full support for Foundry VTT, and an STL file for the Baba Yaga miniature</li>
	<li><strong>The Slipcase for $105</strong>: Digital and Physical copies of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables, GM Screen, and physical art prints</li>
	<li><strong>Core Box for $181:</strong> Everything in The Slipcase tier, a set of miniature standees, Forest Warden dice, and The Adventure Deck</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Box for $324:</strong> Everything in the Core Box and All Digital tier, A deluxe Hardcover copy of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables book, monster deck, magic item cards, and Wayfarer's Journal</li>
	<li><strong>Collector's Box for $658:</strong> Everything from the Deluxe Box tier, signed copies of both core books, a handmade crochet doll of Oh, The Forest Warden, and a master print of the Baba Yaga miniature</li>
</ul><p>It must be noted that the developers address potential import costs for Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch in light of recent US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. According to the campaign, all orders made in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK will be handled within fulfillment centers in said countries. Which means import taxes should be no problem. You will still need to pay for shipping.</p>

<p>The campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$327,152, which is more than ten times their initial funding goal of $</span></span><span><span><span>$21,905. You can still back the project at any tier at time of writing.</span></span></span></p>

                <p>Nintendo has said that Switch 2's eShop won't have any theme music, just like the first Switch didn't, as a result of not wanting to disrupt the user experience.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said, "Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games." Before the Switch, systems like Wii and Wii U had music themes playing as users browsed their respective eShops. "We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there."</p><p>Kawamoto added that he wanted to make sure that browsing the Switch 2 eShop was a smooth experience, that the list doesn't stall, and that pages load fast.

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2’s</a> Joy-Con 2 controllers will not feature Hall Effect analogue sticks, which is sure to raise fears about Joy-Con drift rearing its head for the new generation console.</p>
<p>Having been rather coy about the underlying technology in press Q&amp;A sessions last week, Nintendo Life were able to get an actual answer out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">Nintendo of America’s Nate Bihldorff</a>, who confirmed that the new Joy-Con will not have Hall Effect sticks… but doesn’t state definitively whether that applies to the new Pro Controller.</p>


<p><strong>Nintendo Life – &nbsp;Let’s jump off the sensitivity stuff then and talk about the stick of the Switch 2 Joy-Con because it feels so different to the original Switch’s analog stick. So is it a Hall Effect stick? Were you inspired by the Hall Effect stick?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nate Bihldorff</strong> – Well, the Joy-Con 2’s controllers have been designed from the ground up. They’re not Hall Effect sticks, but they feel really good. Did you experience both the Joy-Con and the Pro Controller?</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life – Both!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nate Bihldorff</strong> – So, I like both, but that Pro Controller, for some reason the first time I grabbed it, I was like, “this feels like a GameCube controller.” I was a GameCube guy. Something about it felt so familiar, but the stick on that especially. I tried to spend a lot of time making sure that it was quiet. I don’t know if you tried really whacking the stick around but it really is [quiet]. I’m thinking back to my Smash Brothers days, where you just whack it. [The Switch 2 Pro Controller] is one of the quietest controllers I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>There’s certainly the possibility that the new Pro Controller has Hall Effect sticks, given that it has added features like back buttons that are typical of pro controllers, but we wouldn’t put money on it.</p>
<p>Having new analogue stick modules that are “designed from the ground up” could make them more resistant to the issue, but this will stil be massively disappointing for anyone who’s had Joy-Con Drift through the Nintendo Switch generation. Potentiometer analogue sticks use physical contact to determine the position of the stick, but this is prone to being worn down over time, and can have dust and residue build up that prevents a good contact. As this happens, Joy-Con can start to “drift” giving an incorrect reading from a neutral position that leads to a consistent directional input.</p>
<p>By contrast, Hall Effect sensors measure magnetic fields instead of using direct contact, making them nigh on impervious to the problem.</p>
<p>It’s not an issue that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch – there’s definitely been an uptick in awareness of the problem amongst PlayStation and Xbox gamers as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/22/nintendo-joycon-drifting-fix-drift-legal-action/">Joy-Con Drift led to lawsuits</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/03/nintendo-will-fix-all-drifting-joy-con-for-free-in-uk-and-eu-even-outside-of-warranty/">Nintendo implementing blanket repair programmes</a> in certain regions, and a cottage industry of DIY repair kits on any open online marketplace. It even went so far that some accessory makers started to produce Hall Effect sticks and both offer them standalone, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/10/the-nyxi-wizard-is-a-gamecube-style-switch-joy-con-with-drift-proof-analogue-sticks/">use them extensively in third party and pro controllers</a>.</p>
<p>At the very least, we hope that Joy-Con 2 continue to use easily replaceable modules, as opposed to soldering the analogue sticks in place, making them better for repair, both at repair partners and by end users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/nintendos-ego-is-likely-why-switch-2-welcome-tour-isnt-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It goes without saying that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 showcase</a> and its announcements will be the biggest news of the year, but it was soured somewhat by an egotistical and elitist decision by Nintendo. They decided to make the greedy decision to charge money for what is nothing more than an interactive manual.</p>

<p><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a neat idea for a game to showcase the unique features of the Switch 2. You move a character around a huge Switch 2 to learn in message prompts and tech demos how everything works. A simple idea that I think most people would happily at least check out. We'd rather play something to show us what's new on Switch 2 than read about it, right?</p>

<h2><em>Welcome Tour</em> Is Certainly Not An <em>Astro's Playroom</em></h2>

<p>I am very down to screw around with whatever little clever demos Nintendo will have to show off the weird features that their first-party games will likely be the only ones to use. Pay for the privilege of participating in what is essentially marketing material though? Nintendo, you’re out of your mind.</p>

<p>The natural comparison is <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, the free game that comes with every PlayStation 5. It shows off all the cool features of the DualSense controller in a cleverly designed platformer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would have no problem paying for <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> at all, as there’s still the meat of a game to sink into even if I don’t care about the neat PlayStation easter eggs or DualSense showcases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=V2GdkJx3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=cECsYTmk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love PowerPoint, <em>Welcome Tour</em> may just be for you.</figcaption></figure><p>While I haven’t had a chance to check out <em>Welcome Tour</em> myself, there are <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/04/a-premium-instruction-manual" rel="nofollow">plenty of previews</a>&nbsp;from outlets that did have an opportunity. All come to a similar conclusion: <em>Welcome Tour </em>is not a game and no one knows what audience exists, if any, that would happily pay for it.</p>

<p>What makes this all even more baffling is that Nintendo had what is inarguably the greatest sales multiplier ever packed in for free in a console with <em>Wii Sports</em>. The Wii’s motion controls were novel and everyone had an immediate showcase of why they were so awesome. I bet a ton of homes still have a Wii hooked up and in use from time to time just for bowling.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Welcome Tour </em>doesn’t seem set up in the least to fill the same role as something like <em>Wii Sports</em>, but Nintendo has seen what free launch games can do. If this is nothing more than some mere marketing material in a snazzy presentation, I can’t quite understand the rationale to get to the decision to charge for it.</p>

<p>Maybe they see <em>Welcome Tour</em> as a mere curiosity that most aren't interested in so they want at least some return, where the potential value of getting something like <em>Wii Sports</em> into people's hands right away is readily understood. I refuse to believe that they think the attach rate for <em>Welcome Tour</em> will be all that high, though who knows what a company that seems to spin gold thinks about anything they create.</p>

<h2><em>Wii Sports</em> Was Free, So Why Not <em>Welcome Tour</em>?</h2>

<p>Nintendo hardly ever gives us insight into their decision making, design process, etc, though, so we'll never get a straight answer. They are pretty happy to go at their own pace and do their own thing. Obviously, it works out for them the majority of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We did get some insight from a book by Reggie Fils-Aimé, the former President of Nintendo of America, however. You can find an outline of the relevant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/reggie-had-to-fight-for-wii-sports-as-a-pack-in-and-miyamoto-wasnt-happy" rel="nofollow">excerpt here from Nintendo Life</a>.</p>

<p>As a quick summary, Reggie and others, particularly from Nintendo of America, were making the argument to include <em>Wii Sports </em>as a free pack-in with the Wii to then President of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata. Obviously, their arguments won out in the end, but there was strong disagreement from legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Miyamoto is quoted as saying, “We do not give away our software,” citing the difficulty that comes in creating games.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=eh4zfmEv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=6tePiPSB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wii Sports</em> had golf, too, just a whole lot more of it.</figcaption></figure><p>In this context with <em>Wii Sports</em>, I am completely sympathetic to Miyamoto’s position here. Obviously, any game, particularly one trying to introduce a whole new way for players to interact with games, is incredibly hard to make well. I think Miyamoto and Nintendo’s track record overall speaks for itself in just how seriously they take making games and making them extremely well.</p>

<p>To toss in a game for free despite all of the hard work, sacrifice, and effort that it took to get it made in the first place? I can see why someone on the creative side like Miyamoto would be annoyed. It can easily come across as a devaluation of game designers’ work overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back to <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour,</em> well, it’s no <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, or even <em>Nintendo Land</em> for that matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Welcome Tour</em> is a virtual tour that looks more like a museum exhibit with PowerPoint presentations and minigames (emphasis on the mini) scattered throughout. As a real-life exhibit to showcase anything from Nintendo, that sounds pretty rad. A game from the company that emphasizes fun in all aspects of their game design that amounts to pretty basic edutainment is certainly not comparable.</p>

<h2>Not Everything You Touch is Gold, Nintendo</h2>

<p>So, Miyamoto and Nintendo overall, I totally stand with you on the righteous side of properly valuing the hard work of creatives. <em>Welcome Tour</em> just isn’t that, though, is it?</p>

<p>That is not to discount the hard work that went into its creation, however. But this is not a piece of software you're selling, it's an interactive instruction manual that should be categorized as marketing more than anything. Consumers aren't scrambling to pay for obvious ads, though. People don’t pay a premium to have ads put back into their services, right?</p>

<p>While Miyamoto’s quote above wasn’t about <em>Welcome Tour</em>, it’s hard not to see its potential influence in such a weird decision here. The arrogance to believe that this is in the same realm as something like a new <em>Mario </em>game is ego gone too far—this is just souped-up marketing material if Nintendo is being honest with themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope Nintendo reevaluates their position on this one, but it doesn’t seem like people will miss much if they don’t feel like shelling out for it anyway.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence remains one of the biggest talking points in video games and many other industries, and now Nintendo of America's president has weighed in to share his thoughts.</p><p>Doug Bowser told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/07/nintendo-president-on-the-new-switch-2-tariffs-and-whats-next.html?jwsource=cl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> that he sees opportunities for AI technologies to enhance productivity in some areas, but when it comes to actual game development, humans will always lead the way.</p><p>"If developers choose to use AI--and it is a discussion right now at Nintendo--it's not the only method of developing games," he said. "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers. Their artistic capabilities. Their insight into how people play. So there is always, always going to be a human touch and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>He added that AI is no different than any other new technology that's come onto the market, saying Nintendo might choose to leverage it if it helps to create "a better gameplay experience."</p><p>It appears Nintendo's executives are aligned in their messaging on this subject, as Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Looking outside Nintendo, Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>AI technology has been used in game development for decades--but what's new and different in recent years is what's referred to as generative artificial intelligence. Many remain concerned that growth of the generative AI market could lead to job losses, and companies like EA and others have admitted this is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">legitimate concern</a>.</p><p>The video game industry has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">faced brutal layoffs in 2023 and 2024</a>, though what role advances to artificial intelligence technologies has had on these cuts is unknown.</p><p>In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> launches in June.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>'s live-action movie adaptation has reportedly found its writer and director, with A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski said to be at the helm.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/">Deadline</a>, Sarnoski - whose other directorial credits include 2021's Nicholas Cage-starring Pig and the upcoming Death of Robin Hood - will serve as director <em>and</em> writer on the project, which is a joint venture between Kojima Productions and A24.
</p>
<p>
A Death Stranding movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">initially announced in December 2022</a>, when it was said to be "on the fast track with development underway". Not long after, Kojima revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-taking-an-arthouse-approach-with-death-standing-movie">he's "aiming for a more arthouse approach" with the movie</a>, so it made total sense when last year brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">news of his partnership with A24</a> - the production and distribution company behind the likes of The Brutalist, Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All At One, and The Zone of Interest.

<p>
Beyond Sarnoski's reported involvement, little has been revealed about the Death Standing movie so far. It'll take place in the same post-apocalyptic setting as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sams-from-all-over-the-world-are-still-delivering-celebrates-kojima-with-latest-death-stranding-milestone">extremely popular</a> first game - which presumably means it'll also features invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, and other outlandish delights - but it's unclear if it'll be a direct adaptation or a brand-new story.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it sound like the Death Stranding movie is still some way off - but it's unlikely series fans will be too concerned given a fully fledged game sequel is launching very soon. As revealed last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> launches for PS5 on 26th June, complete with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">its very own fake Snake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">stop-motion puppet companion</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warzone Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the Kilo 141 to cause chaos in Verdansk. Our Loadout will make the iconic AR dominate just as much as it did back in 2021.</p>



<p>Longtime series veterans will feel right at home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> in Season 3. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/">HDR</a>, Grau, and Kilo 141 are all back, giving players access to the four weapons that initially reigned supreme on the map.</p>



<p>In addition, Verdansk has a fresh coat of paint, as Raven Software improved the beloved map with enhanced visuals, lighting, and new textures. As players return and try to determine which AR is the best in Season 3, the Kilo 141 stands out as a clear contender.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Which Optic you use comes down to personal preference, but the other attachments are a must. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/wz3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueGameData</a>, The <strong>AK-74 and CR-56 AMAX</strong> have the <strong>two fastest time-to-kill speeds</strong> among long-range meta weapons. In saying that, the Kilo 141 isn’t too far behind, and the AR is easier to control due to its forgiving recoil pattern and steady fire rate.</p>



<p>Although you won’t get the same damage output from the Kilo 141 as with the CR-56 AMAX or AK-74, the reliable AR has a faster fire rate and bullet velocity than other top choices and shines even brighter with this set of attachments. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Willis 3X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Monolithic Suppressor </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>UnderBarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II </li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Be aware that this SMG does have some kick despite the attachments. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the Kilo 141 is better suited for medium and long-range engagements, the best sidekick for this AR is an SMG to support short-range gunfights between 0 and 10 meters. </p>



<p>After having its maximum, medium, and minimum damage ranges buffed in Season 3 and its upper torso damage multiplier, the Kompakt 92 has the fastest time-to-kill of 550 milliseconds up to 13 meters away. A difficult-to-reign-in recoil pattern means using this SMG requires significant skill, but it’s lethal in the right hands. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Infiltrator Stockn</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Scavenger</strong>, <strong>Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Alertness</strong> are the best trio of Perks in Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Scavenger (Start equipped with maximum reserve ammo for your primary weapon. Resupply ammo equipment and plates from dead enemies)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Tracker (See enemy footsteps. Bullets you fire briefly outline an enemy for you and your squad)</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Alertness (Sense enemies when enemies are nearby. Tell when you are being aimed at by the enemy)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Since armor plates are so hard to come by, <strong>Scavenger</strong> is a must-use Perk for every loadout because you can get more armor off dead enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, losing enemies while chasing after them on Verdansk is easy, so <strong>Tracker </strong>allows you to see their recent footsteps. Also, hitting an enemy further away increases the time they are outlined. And even though Raven Software added new objects on the map to provide cover in open areas, there is always the danger of getting taken out by a one-shot sniper or an enemy with better positioning than you. <strong>Alertness</strong> alleviates this issue by pinging your screen when someone sees you.</p>







<p><strong>Overkill</strong> is the best Wildcard to use. In Season 3, Raven Software removed the ability to purchase loadout weapons from the Buy Station. As a result, the only way to acquire loadout weapons is through loadout drops. </p>



<p>So, while having three extra attachments on a weapon with the Gunfighter Wildcard would be nice, we recommend using Overkill to give you a second primary weapon because acquiring one will otherwise be difficult. </p>

This video game movie has had the support of various toy marketing campaigns from the very beginning, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> as well as McDonald's toys targeted specifically at adults. But if you're in the market for a Nerf gun after seeing the movie in theaters, you also already have quite a few options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is offering new discounts on a variety of Nerf <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Weapons">Minecraft weapons</a> based on <em>actual </em>Minecraft weapons. Each of these Nerf picks have the ability to shoot darts, even if they don't necessarily appear to be able to. They are also all fairly cheap compared to other Minecraft toys on the market right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Nerf Minecraft Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four Nerf Minecraft deals at Amazon right now, and almost all of them are at their lowest prices of 2025. The best deal within this list is the Minecraft Pillager's Crossbow, which has only recently <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CSLJH4M5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">droppped to its lowest-ever price</a> of $19.99. This is one of the most affordable Nerf crossbows you can buy, and it also doubles as a wonderful Minecraft gift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of this blaster, there's also the Nerf Minecraft axe and hammer, which are each under $20 and at their lowest prices in 2025. While they don't function as effectively as a standard Nerf gun, they look awesome and are still able to fire darts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Nerf Minecraft option that is on sale is the Sabrewing Motorized Blaster. Although it is arguably the coolest thing on sale right now, it is nowhere near its lowest price of 2025. It is, however, still priced below $20 and is the most enticing actualy Nerf Blaster on this list. It also has the largest dart capacity at eight darts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Nerf Ammo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve secured a Nerf Blaster, grabbing some extra darts or rounds is always a good idea. If you’ve ever played with one of these before, you know that ammo goes missing way too quickly. Luckily, a range of nerf darts are on sale. Big 100 packs for an epic war with friends or smaller, ultra-cheap sets to replace a few missing darts are all discounted right now. Just be sure to grab the right ammo.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 7, 2025 4:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, sci-fi co-operative shooter from the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, now known as Reburn. We now have a release date set for this new shooter.</p>
<p>It'll be arriving on PC on Steam at the end of this month, on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, though anyone who is keen to try the game as soon as possible can request to be a part of a closed beta test the studio is hosting for 24 hours beginning this Saturday, April 12, 2025. You can register your interest for the beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>La Quimera takes players to a dystopian version of Latin America in the year 2064, where most of the global systems we know today have collapsed, and humanity continues on in fractured segments around the world. It's a confusing and chaotic time, but it's also the golden age for private mercenary forces, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>That setting is also what lends the game to its cooperative experience while also being a story-driven game. You can play through the story with two friends alongside you, taking advantage of all the futuristic gadgets you'll have, like exoskeletons that make you stronger and faster and weapons that are unlike any of the killing machines we have today.</p>
<p>Along with announcing the release date, Reburn also revealed a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, Reburn's chief executive officer and co-founder, also added in the announcement that "<em>Our Reburn team can't wait to finally share our hard work and vision for La Quimera on April 25. </em><em>[...] As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn't be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we're profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience."</em></p>
