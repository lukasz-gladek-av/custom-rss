            <link>https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/united-healthcare-shooting-suspect%E2%80%99s-gaming-history-tells-us-that-healthcare-in-america-sucks.1056411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione</a> in connection to last week’s shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The handsome suspect and his alleged actions <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitter-americans-react-to-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-my-empathy-is-out-of-network-2000534520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought the internet together</a>, and now we’ve been brought together again in the age-old practice of combing through Mangione's internet history. The literary-minded are diving into his <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/luigi-mangione-united-healthcare-goodreads-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads account</a>, politics reporters are looking at his <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/murky-wing-politics-alleged-uhc-193654118.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-has-connections-to-the-videogame-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> sites are looking at his gaming history.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery why sites are doing this. At websites that depend on SEO, and even at news sites more broadly, it’s a pretty obvious thing to do: people are justifiably interested in Mangione, who he is and what might have motivated him. If some facet of that dovetails with the subject of your site, it’s a no-brainer to write it up, both to serve your specific readership and try to catch some of the spike in search interest before it expires.</p><p>And it even makes sense why non-journalists would read these stories, and why they’d do digging of their own. Often, readers do this because a violent event is so shocking, but what felt so unique about Thompson’s shooting was the general relatability of it all, a certain lack of outrage that crossed political divides. It wasn’t really a mystery why someone would do something like this to a health insurance CEO, one who oversaw a company rife with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/06/business/insurance-claim-denials-unitedhealthcare-ceo/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coverage denials and horror stories</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing that’s been uncovered so far about Mangione, who was arrested on firearms charges but has not been charged with the shooting, changes that fact. Neither his reading or gaming history or the speculation that he <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/unitedhealthcare-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-read-books-chronic-pain-1997995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered from back pain</a> is necessary to explain what he might have done. The alleged gaming-related details of his life are pedestrian: He is an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app developer</a> who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020, where he helped start a game development club due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200426034424/https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/student-club-highlights-interdisciplinary-art-making-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interest in indie games</a>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-has-connections-to-the-videogame-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> says his LinkedIn account suggests he interned at Firaxis in 2016 to help with <em>Civilization VI, </em>the kind of thing a young person interested in game development might do. On Reddit, a user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogamedunkey/comments/1haj7qb/the_alleged_uhc_assassin_was_a_dunkey_fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared an image</a> of what could be Mangione’s high school yearbook entry, featuring a silly quote by YouTuber Dunkey that reveals nothing but the possibility that he watched YouTube, the way millions of people do every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Wired identified an <a href="https://www.xboxgamertag.com/search/lmangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox account</a> that shares Mangione’s name, which doesn’t seem to have been used in over a decade. That account shows playtime in Call of Duty, Halo, Gears of War, and Alan Wake. PC Gamer also identified a<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198111618038/games/?tab=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Steam account</a> potentially belonging to Mangione, noting that it’s the “admin of a small Steam group for the game development club that Mangione belonged to at the University of Pennsylvania.” That account has been more recently used, with top games including <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Terraria</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, and <em>Civ VI</em>.</p><p>These are all the kinds of games a regular person who plays games plays, the way so many regular people play games. Mangione may have played Call of Duty, so <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/08/05/trump-republican-focus-on-video-games-and-call-of-duty-after-mass-shootings-is-a-transparent-distraction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/lawsuit-argues-call-of-duty-helped-cause-the-uvalde-school-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">referenced</a> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2019/08/07/five-things-to-know-about-video-games-and-mass-shootings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748387407/video-games-are-still-blamed-for-gun-violence-despite-studies-showing-no-connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shootings</a> as some kind of explanation, but it was over a decade ago, one wildly popular game in a possible history of popular AAA and indie games. These games tell us nothing about why a man was murdered in cold blood, and they don’t need to. We already know why. People are sick of this shit; of this broken system and the seeming invincibility of the people who perpetuate it, of the growing impossibility of living a normal life where you go to school and play video games and listen to audiobooks at the gym and if you hurt your back you’ll be able to get care for it without crawling through a labyrinth of hoops and bankrupting yourself in the process.</p><p>There is no mystery to unravel here, beyond the <a href="https://defector.com/i-would-not-take-my-post-assassination-meal-at-an-altoona-mcdonalds-but-i-guess-im-built-different" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat baffling choices</a> Mangione may have made post-shooting, and beyond why the <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/two-manhattan-murder-investigations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYPD</a> exists at all. We won’t learn anything new about Mangione by looking through his history. We already know everything we need to.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Payments have been sent to folks who filed a claim before the original February 2024 deadline--but don't worry, there's still more time to get in on this settlement if you missed out previously.</p><p>At issue, according to the FTC, was "Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration [which] led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button." This refers to how the item shop used to allow players to make a purchase with a single, instant button push, and there was only a very brief window within which it was possible to cancel the purchase. The additions of the "hold-to-purchase" interaction in the shop, as well as the 24-hour window to cancel a purchase, were the result of this and similar suits in Europe.</p><p>As part of the claims process, users could choose to be paid via check or PayPal. Those who chose PayPal and have an approved claim--which the FTC  said makes up about half of the 629,344 payments in this round--should have received the money in their accounts on Monday. Those who opted for a check will receive it later.</p><p>This round of payments totaled about $72 million, which means users received a little over $100 on average, though the totals varied based on how much each person had spent during the window of time that this settlement applied to, with players receiving $250-300 on the high end.</p><p>For those who haven't filed a claim but want to get in on these refunds, it's still possible to do so--this first round of payments is only a third of the total Epic is supposed to pay, and the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FTC is still taking claims on its website here</a>. Just keep in mind this is only for folks who played Fortnite prior to September 2022, so newer players need not apply.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
With just days to go until The Game Awards 2024, developers are taking the opportunity to whip fans into a fury of anticipation by revealing ahead of time that, yes, their games will appear - with showings for both Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 now officially confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country's "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily" was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced earlier this year</a>, and developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has now <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">taken to social media</a> with a simple, "See you at The Game Awards!". This fourth series instalment is due to launch next year, so the timing makes sense for a more substantial look beyond its initial teaser trailer.
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been yapping excitedly about it since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">unveiling back in August</a>. And he's now popped up to tease the shooter's impending Game Awards appearance. "It's happening, you guys!," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">wrote on social media</a>. "I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can't wait!"

<p>
"Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer!," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733">continued</a>. "Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!"
</p><p>
Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit</a> with Nintendo - has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">confirmed a Game Awards appearance</a>, promising fans, "You won’t want to miss it!". And it probably won't surprise anyone to hear <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will also be at this year's show, his appearance alongside host and pal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> now almost as inevitable as the setting sun. But what might he reveal? A Death Stranding 2 release date? More of his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">intriguing Xbox horror game OD</a>? Only time, and perhaps a 45-minute show segment, will tell.
</p>
<p>
The Game Awards 2024 airs this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK - but especially enthusiastic sorts can tune in half an hour earlier if they fancy a bit of a pre-show. 2023's event went on well into the wee hours, so if you value your sleep like a sensible person, you can always catch up at a more reasonable time via Eurogamer's coverage.

Season 4 Episode 7 launches on Tuesday, and Episode 8, which is set to release on January 14th, 2025, will “serve as the last seasonal Episode for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” </em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive">announced on Monday</a>.</p><p>After the release of the final content, the game will still be available to play online, according to <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">a WB Games FAQ</a>. But the game is also getting an offline mode tomorrow — which had been <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-getting-an-offline-mode-after-all-but-not-until-sometime-after-its-out/">previously announced</a>, though without a specific date beyond “2024” — that will let you play the main story and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection.</p><p>The game has had a troubled history. The game was originally set to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376280/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-game-trailer-rocksteady">in 2022</a> before being delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22992865/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay-spring-2023-announcement-ps5-xsx-pc">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23682376/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-february-2024">times</a>. And a largely unsuccessful launch — in our review, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc">we said</a> the game “hides its brash personality under a generic looter shooter” — resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery announcing in May that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady">taking a $200 million loss</a> on the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Despite releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is filled to the brim with content. From the main story campaign to side bosses to an endless endgame, you're certainly getting your money's worth by participating in early access. Some players could find hundreds of hours of gameplay in Path of Exile 2 just through the game's initial content.</p><p>However, if you're trying to gauge exactly how much time you have to spend in Path of Exile 2 before "beating it," that's another story. Below, you can find how long it takes to beat Path of Exile 2, how long it takes to reach the endgame, and a full quest list so you can track your progress.</p><h2>How long to beat Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Since Path of Exile 2 is an ARPG, you can never truly "beat it." Most ARPGs follow a similar structure of progressing through a main campaign that's followed by the endgame. The endgame is what you make of it and you could spend however much time you want with a given character participating in endgame content.</p><p>With that in mind, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">beating Path of Exile 2</a> can be defined as simply reaching the endgame and getting past all the campaign acts. In early access, there are three acts you need to progress through before reaching the endgame. This number of acts will eventually be doubled to six in the full release of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761"></a><figcaption>Act 2 features a completely new zone and quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png"></figure><p>However, just beating the three acts doesn't get you to the endgame. Instead, you need to first beat the three acts on standard difficulty, which gets you to level 45. Then, you're required to beat Acts 1-3 again on Cruel difficulty to finally reach the endgame. Doing all of this should result in your character being around level 65.</p><p>Your first time <strong>beating the three acts should take 25 or so hours</strong> in Path of Exile 2. Then, you'll need another 15-20 hours to get past the acts again on Cruel difficulty. This puts the time to reach the endgame anywhere from 40-50 hours per character.</p><p>If you want to play as another class in Path of Exile 2, you'll have to repeat the same process over again. This means another 40-50 hours to reach the endgame with that character.</p><p>Once you reach the endgame in Path of Exile 2, the world is your oyster. You have the freedom to spend any additional amount of time with any character as you progress through endgame content. The maximum level cap in Path of Exile 2 early access is level 100, though, so it might not be worth it to try and go past that level just yet.</p><h2>Path of Exile 2 full quest list</h2><p>One of the best ways to track your progress during the main story is by checking what quest you're on. If you know the names and order of the quests in each act, you can accurately gauge how far away you are from the next act.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762"></a><figcaption>A full quest list for Act 1.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png"></figure><p>Below, you'll find the full three-act main quest list in Path of Exile 2:</p><p><strong>Act 1</strong></p><ul><li>Reaching Clearfell  <ul><li>Mercy for the Miller</li></ul></li><li>Secrets in the Dark</li><li>The Mysterious Shade</li><li>Sorrow Among Stones</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>The Mad Wolf of Ogham</li></ul><p><strong>Act 2</strong></p><ul><li>Earning Passage</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>A Theft of Ivory</li><li>The City of Seven Waters</li><li>A Crown of Stone</li></ul><p><strong>Act 3</strong></p><ul><li>Legacy of the Vaal</li><li>The Vaal Jungle</li><li>Mysteries of the Vaal</li></ul><p>There are more quests in Act 3, but that's all players have seen up to this point.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> has a three-act campaign experience in early access plus loads of endgame content to dive into. You can take part in the story as a solo character, only relying on your abilities for help, or as a part of a six-player party. Five additional players are supported to join you on your journey, but you're free to make a party of any size up to that number.</p><p>While making a party for your friends and blasting your way through Path of Exile 2 together sounds great, the logistics of getting that set up can be complicated. Allow us to explain everything you need to know about adding friends and making a party in Path of Exile 2.</p><h2>How to add friends in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Path of Exile 2 makes it easy to add friends, as all you need is their username and tag number. As we've explained in a previous guide, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-cross-play-explained/1100-6527844/" data-ref-id="1100-6527844">Path of Exile 2 is fully cross-play</a>, so you can add any friend regardless of their system.</p><p>To add a friend, simply open the Social tab (J on keyboard by default) and find the "Friends" tab. From there, just type in your friend's username and the number that follows the "#" sign after their name in the "Friend Invite" box. If you've typed in everything correctly, press "Send" and your friend will get the request in their Social tab.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412577-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-15.44.05.30.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412577" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412577-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-15.44.05.30.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412577"></a><figcaption>The Social menu in Path of Exile 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412577-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-15.44.05.30.png"></figure><p>Alternatively, you can find your friend requests in the Social tab as well. You can view your requests in the "Friends" tab under the "Invitations Received" box. You'll also be able to view all of your online and offline friends from here as well.</p><p>As a note, the Social tab looks differently if you're on keyboard and mouse or controller. However, the menu acts the same way, as you still need to view the Friends tab and type in a friend's name and tag to add them.</p><p>If you're already a part of a Guild in Path of Exile 2, scroll over one tab to view the "Guild" section of the Social menu. Here, you can view your Guild and see everyone that's online. This allows you to message them privately and invite them to a party in-game. If you're not part of a Guild yet, this is also where you can join one or view your invites to a Guild.</p><h2>How to make a party in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Once you add some friends in Path of Exile 2, it's time to get all of you in a party together. To do this, follow the steps below:</p><ul><li>Scroll over to the "Create Party" tab from the Social menu.</li><li>Here, you'll have the option to create a party or join a party.</li><li>If you want to create a party, select that option and invite any online friends to join it. You can also make your party public and have anyone join it.</li><li>You can set certain restrictions on your party, which include opening it up to friends only or invite only.</li><li>Once someone joins the party, you'll be notified so you can all group up in the same location.</li><li>To join a party, select that option. However, this will only allow you to join Public Parties, which are parties that others have made.</li><li>To join a friend's party, click on their name in your friends list and if their party is open to friends, you can join it.</li><li>If your friend's party is set to invite only, you'll need an invite from them to join the party.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412581-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.34.11.10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412581" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412581-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.34.11.10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412581"></a><figcaption>Creating or making a party in the Social menu. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412581-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.34.11.10.png"></figure><p>Everything relating to friends and parties is managed through the Social menu, so when all else fails, check there to view any requests, invites, or your friends list.</p><h2>How to play couch co-op in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Of course, going through the friends list isn't the only way to play in a party in Path of Exile 2. The game also supports couch co-op, meaning you can play with another person from the same system you're using. To play in couch co-op, you need two controllers connected to your system and you'll need to make two separate characters as well. This is not possible with two sets of keyboards and mice.</p><p>With your two controllers connected, go to the character selection screen. In the top-left, press the settings cog and go to the Input menu. Make sure your input is set to "Controller." Once that's done, go back to the character selection screen and each controller should have the ability to create or select a character. Player 1 will be on the left side of the screen and Player 2 is on the right.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412672-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-16.03.24.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412672" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412672-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-16.03.24.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412672"></a><figcaption>Connecting a second controller will let you play in couch co-op.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412672-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-16.03.24.45.png"></figure><p>If you don't see the option to make a second character, you'll likely see "P2: Connect a controller" in the top-right of the screen. This means your second controller either isn't connected or isn't working.</p><p>After you get both characters up and running, you can play Path of Exile 2 as you normally would. Only now, your screen will be split into two.</p><h2>Can you disable cross-play in Path of Exile 2?</h2><p>While Path of Exile 2 offers full cross-play between PS5, Xbox, and PC, some players might only want to see players from their specific system in-game.</p><p>However, there doesn't appear to be a way to fully disable cross-play. If you go through all the settings and the Social menu, you won't find an option to disable or enable the feature. It's possible the ability to turn off cross-play could arrive later in early access or at the full launch, though.</p><p>For now, if you're on Xbox Series X|S or PS5, you can disable cross-play across your entire system through the console's settings. This is done through the "Account and Network" settings of your console. PC players currently have no way to disable cross-play in Path of Exile 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eight-of-octobers-best-selling-games-were-new-releases-black-ops-6-on-top/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>October saw a lot of huge releases this month, including the highly-anticipated release of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as well as games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Overall, the month saw a lot of huge releases, with a lot of them performing incredibly well and hitting major milestones for the franchise or developer.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail and digital games, it's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was on the top of the charts. Even though the exact number has not been confirmed by Activision or Treyarch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">they have announced that this game</a> was the best-selling in the franchise thus far and crushed major milestones for the game. In addition, Circana has <a href="https://www.circana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had the most promotional volume, capturing 70 promotions for this game. It was promoted in stores like GameStop, with front-page coverage on websites like GameStop, Target, Walmart, and Amazon.</p>
<p>In terms of Twitch content, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a> remained on top for the month of October, as the semifinals of Worlds took place on October 27, which was the most-watched event. Peak concurrent viewership reached 1.64&nbsp; million viewers. While they didn't make the top five, both Silent Hill 2 and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero debuted in the top 10 games, with Silent Hill 2 taking seventh place and Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero! Just about making it at number nine.</p>
<p>Another surprise was <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">the massive success of Silent Hill 2</a>. While there were a lot of people who had faith that the game would be done well, Bloober Team has not had a stellar reputation in the past, leading a lot of hardcore Silent Hill fans to feel uncertain about the game. However, it did incredibly well, sold well, and has been nominated for multiple awards in different ceremonies. Additionally, Silent Hill 2 had 37 unique promotions, as captured by Circana. This comes as a surprise, considering the game has no Xbox Release. However, it's been confirmed by PlayStation that Silent Hill 2 was at the top of reorders, among the top games in the country, and among the top new games, with Steam promoting the game on its front page banner.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail, Sonic x Shadow Generations took the seventh place for unique promotions, and was one of two Sega titles in the top 10, with the other game being Metaphor: ReFantazio, another title that did incredibly well in sales and has been nominated for multiple awards.</p>
<p>October was a very stacked month, whereas November was relatively quiet and didn't have as many big titles. It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was a major performer across a lot of categories in the Circana report.</p>

                <p>The Monk is one of the six available classes in the early access build of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>. It's a mixed melee and ranged class that has access to a few different types of builds, all of which are hugely rewarding if used properly. While the Monk seems fairly weak at the start of Path of Exile 2, it only gets stronger as the game goes on, culminating in an extremely strong endgame character.</p><p>If you want some tips on how to build your Monk or advice on what skills to use, we have everything you need in the guide below.</p><h2>Monk Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>When you first start Path of Exile 2 as a Monk, you'll have access to a constant quarterstaff melee attack, as well as some basic ranged, elemental skills. The Monk can make use of both lightning and frost damage as well as air skills that can damage and/or stun enemies. During the early game, you'll want to use any skill that's first presented to you, regardless of its damage type.</p><p>However, as you level your Monk into the teens, you can start focusing on one or two damage types to really synergize the build. This will help you establish a clear direction for your passive ability skill tree and make it easier to choose an Ascendancy for your Monk eventually.</p><p>Regardless of your level, you want to try to increase your Dexterity and Intelligence attributes as much as possible. The Monk is a mobile class that relies on dodging enemy attacks up close and from a distance. Dexterity helps keep your Monk as mobile as possible, while the Intelligence attribute ensures you have enough mana to cast all the elemental skills you can access.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412447-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.38.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412447" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412447-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.38.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412447"></a><figcaption>Dexterity and Intelligence are your main attributes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412447-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.38.67.png"></figure><p>After a while, you'll likely want to ditch your basic quarterstaff melee attack to focus solely on those elemental skills. In the early game, though, those melee attacks will likely deal the most damage to enemies, so spam it whenever you get into trouble. Quarterstaff attacks also don't use any mana, which is a nice bonus in the early levels but as you progress, you'll usually have enough mana to spam other skills and still have some left over.</p><h2>Best Monk Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Now that you better understand the Monk in Path of Exile 2, it's time to go over what kind of skills you want to use. Currently, the best route for a Monk is utilizing most of the lightning skills the class can use. However, you also want to pair those lightning skills with one or two air skills.</p><p>In the early game, feel free to mix the lightning and air skills with a frost skill, since you'll have some space on your hotbar anyway. Glacial Cascade is the best frost skill that can be a highly effective boss killer for the Monk. This ranged skill creates a line of frost on the ground and explodes after reaching a certain point. Spamming this against bosses from a few meters away can deal tons of damage and also freeze the boss, opening them up to additional attacks.</p><p>We won't be using Glacial Cascade in our final build, though, as that's full of lightning and air skills that punish enemies up close and from far away. Here are the skills we recommend for a Monk in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Falling Thunder</li><li>Killing Palm</li><li>Staggering Palm</li><li>Tempest Bell</li><li>Tempest Flurry</li><li>Whirling Assault</li><li>Gathering Storm</li><li>Flicker Strike</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412442-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.55.11.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412442" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412442-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.55.11.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412442"></a><figcaption>The skills for a Monk range in elemental damage and type of attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412442-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.55.11.png"></figure><p>Your build truly starts when you reach level 12 and can unlock the Tempest Flurry skill. This can essentially replace your basic quarterstaff attack, as it's a combo melee skill that inflicts lightning damage. After a full combo, the skill ends with a thunderous, AoE lightning strike.</p><p>You can use Tempest Flurry in concert with the Tempest Bell, which relies on you getting a four-hit melee combo. Once that combo is hit, you can throw down a large bell, dealing damage each time you strike it with an attack. The bell deals air damage by default but if you hit it with a lightning attack, it will deal the same type of damage.</p><p>Placing down the Tempest Bell and standing still to hit it will require a full shield/HP bar, though, as enemies will continue to hit you. If there are too many enemies around, using the Falling Thunder skill to clear out large groups is an effective strategy. Falling Thunder relies on the power charge system however, which gives you stronger attacks when fully built up. When enemies are at low health from your attacks, finish them off with Killing or Staggering Palm.</p><p>At the later levels, you unlock skills like Whirling Assault, Gathering Storm, and Flicker Strike. Flicker Strike, in particular, is a useful addition, as it allows you to jump from enemy to enemy dealing damage. This gives the Monk extra mobility to stay out of harm's way. If you just want to clear out hordes of enemies, though, Whirling Assault is your best bet.</p><h2>Best Monk Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>With the basic skills out of the way, you can now equip those skills with the right Support Gems. You'll also start to receive Spirit Gems, which can be used to equip your Monk with extra buffs.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Perpetual Charge (Falling Thunder)</li><li>Lightning Infusion (Falling Thunder)</li><li>Ruthless (Tempest Bell)</li><li>Magnified Effect (Tempest Bell)</li><li>Life Drain (Killing Palm)</li><li>Profusion (Killing Palm)</li><li>Overpower (quarterstaff attack)</li><li>Conduction (Tempest Flurry)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412443-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.28.29.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412443-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.28.29.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412443"></a><figcaption>Support Gems can help your Monk's skills perform better.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412443-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.28.29.16.png"></figure><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Herald of Thunder</li><li>Lingering Illusion</li></ul><p>In general, you want to stick with the Dexterity Support Gems when looking to kit out your Monk. There are plenty of solid options for all your skills that increase elemental damage, improve potential charges, and give you more area of effect.</p><h2>Best Monk Passive Skills</h2><p>Every time you level up with the Monk, you'll receive points to put into the Passive Ability skill tree. For the most part, you'll want to stick with nodes that deal with lightning damage, but there are some specific nodes you should grab as soon as possible:</p><ul><li>Conservative Casting</li><li>Killer Instinct</li><li>Flow Like Water</li><li>Step Like Mist</li><li>Essence of the Storm</li><li>Immortal Infamy</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412444-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.25.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412444" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412444-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.25.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412444"></a><figcaption>Passive Abilities help your Monk in a variety of ways.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412444-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-14.29.25.50.png"></figure><h2>Best Monk Ascendancy</h2><p>Finally, after leveling your Monk enough, you'll have to pick an Ascendancy.

This Ascendancy promotes the use of elemental attacks and buildup, meaning you'll deal more damage with your lightning attacks and have a higher chance to shock enemies. Specifically, The Invoker has a passive ability called "I am Thunder" that grants you extra lightning damage and the ability to shock the ground around you.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Raf Grassetti - principal artist on 2018's God of War and, later, art director on its acclaimed sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> - has announced he's starting a "new chapter" at The Last of Us developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>, following the closure of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s "AAA" studio in October.
</p>
<p>
Grassetti joined Sony Santa Monica in 2013, rising through the ranks to become studio art director in 2022. However, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-god-of-war-art-director-joins-halo-veterans-new-netflix-project">announced his departure</a> last May, revealing he'd joined Netflix Games to work on a new AAA title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">alongside Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten</a>, former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and ex-Coalition technical director Jerry Edsall.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, that project proved to be short-lived. Netflix announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">pulling the plug</a> on its development - and disbanding the studio - this October, without ever revealing what the team had been working on over the preceding 18 months.
</p>
<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Last of Us season 2 teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOsAJ7oe2QE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Since then, it's been speculated Staten has rejoined Halo Studios, given the company closed its job listing for a creative director around the time of his Netflix departure. And Grassetti has now revealed his own return to old haunts as part of a "new chapter", albeit in this instance swapping one renowned Sony studio for another.
</p><p>
"I'm super excited to be joining the amazing crew and project over at Naughty Dog, and to be back to Playstation," Grassetti <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDXFHncpzt3/">wrote on social media</a>. "I'm joining [Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann] and his team as art director, to help create the next big thing! A huge thanks to everybody who was involved in making this happen and all my friends from sister studios. I'm hyped and can’t wait to share more about it! Cheers!"
</p>
<p>
As to what Grassetti'll be working on at Naughty Dog, that remains shrouded in secrecy. The studio hasn't released a new game (discounting remasters) since 2020's The Last of Us Part 2. Its most recently announced project was its standalone The Last of Us multiplayer game - but that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled in December</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Naughty Dog teased it was working on "more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game", and it seems likely one of these will be The Last of Us Part 3, given the huge success of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation and Neil Druckmann's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">recent suggestion</a> there's "probably one more chapter to this story". There's also been speculation the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">working on a fantasy-themed title</a> - but as to where Raf Grassetti might currently be focusing his energies in his new Naughty Dog role, that remains to be seen.

Its mix of vulnerability, sentimentality, and disarming goofiness has made it a Christmas movie classic for decades, but there’s also plenty of ick. Actor Keira Knightley recently shared her own reaction to one of the movie’s most infamous scenes. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It comes near the end when all of the characters are coming to terms with their individual situations on Christmas Eve.

It’s a catharsis that only comes after she previously discovered his recording of her wedding, complete with a stalker’s focus exclusively on her. </p><p>“The slightly stalkerish aspect of it—I <em>do</em> remember that,” Knightley recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-12-05/keira-knightley-black-doves-netflix&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-12-05/keira-knightley-black-doves-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>L.A. Times</em></a></span> as part of a press tour for her new Netflix thriller series <em>Black Doves</em>. “My memory is of [director] Richard [Curtis], who is now a very dear friend, of me doing the scene, and him going, ‘No, you’re looking at [Lincoln] like he’s creepy,’ and I’m like [in a dramatic whisper], ‘But it <em>is</em> quite creepy.’ And then having to redo it to fix my face to make him seem not creepy.”</p><p>In retrospect, you can still look back and read Knightley’s scrunch-faced reaction as her character being slightly put-off by the whole stunt, though the scene itself is shot and edited in such a way as to signal that we should see it all as romantic and endearing. Of course, adding to the creep factor is that Knightley was also only 17 at the time the movie was shot. “I mean, there <em>was</em> a creep factor at the time, right?” she added. “Also, I knew I was 17. It only seems like a few years ago that <em>everybody</em>&nbsp;<em>else</em> realized I was 17.”</p><p><em>Love Actually</em> came out the same year as <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</em>, which catapulted Knightley into the upper echelons of stardom. She said the ensuing hyper-scrutiny from fans, media, and others made the success come at a great cost. “I had a five-year period between the age of 17 and 21-ish, and I’m never going to have that kind of success again,” she told the <em>L.A. Times</em>. “It totally set me up for life. Did it come at a cost? Yes, it did. It came at a <em>big</em> cost. Knowing the cost, could I, in all good conscience, say to my kid, you should do that? No. But am I grateful for it? Yes. But then that’s life, isn’t it? Luckily, my kids are completely uninterested.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-in-rainbow-six-soniqs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Shopify Rebellion has burst onto the Rainbow Six Siege scene after assuming control of the former Soniqs roster.</p>



<p>It was revealed three days ago by Seth ‘supr’ Hoffman that Soniqs ‘no longer wished to invest in Rainbow Six’ and that the whole team was being unceremoniously booted to the curb. This now means that Surf, Ambi, Rexen, Gryxr, and Canadian will represent Shopify Rebellion going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-org-same-squad">New Org, Same Squad</h2>



<p>This is Shopify Rebellion’s first outing in Rainbow Six Siege, and it comes out of the blue after Soniqs was disbanded… Well, out of the blue. Here’s what supr had to say about the change:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I, along with the rest of the Rainbow Six Siege team, are no longer with Soniqs. I was told following the Montreal Major that Soniqs no longer wished to invest in Rainbow Six – a decision that I completely understand – and have decided that my passion for Siege and dedication to the team that I started six years ago is what is most important to me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supr also transitioned to Shopify Rebellion and will support the core roster as GM and head coach.</p>



<p>This is a new and powerful arrow in Shopify Rebellion’s quiver. The organisation has had a great year and covers a wide variety of esports titles, from League of Legends to Halo, and from Rocket League to VALORANT.</p>



<p>Heading into February’s Six Invitational in Boston, Shopify Rebellion will have a spot with this newly acquired squad, making the event something of a baptism by fire for the organisation.</p>



<p>Recently in the Rainbow Six space, a touch of bad news hit the Cloud9 Beastcoast roster. M80 acquired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Beastcoast brand</a> and cast out the Major-winning squad, and now the team is org-less ahead of the Six Invitational.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players have discovered a match-ending nuke Easter egg on one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>'s multiplayer maps. This is a secret nuke that doesn't require an impressive 25-killstreak to unlock, but it still won't be a cakewalk to pull off. Don't worry about nukes ruining all your matches either, as this Easter egg is seemingly only available in private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Warhead multiplayer map is designed to be a test site similar to the fan-favorite Nuketown map, but this variant shows the buildings and cars of Nuketown dumped in the Nevada desert and filled with sand. The map also contains a giant warhead that can be used for cover.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, players have discovered that if they dump enough bullets into the warhead, it will explode and end the match. As shown in the video clip shared by "<a href="https://x.com/M3RKMUS1C/status/1865495113377403358" rel="nofollow ">M3RKMUS1C</a>," the warhead takes tons of ammo to detonate. Additionally, detonating the nuke results in a match loss for all players.</p><p dir="ltr">Those loading into a private match to try this out with friends will want to make sure they build a class with enough ammo. Using the Overkill Wildcard should help, and picking weapons with high-ammo counts like light machine guns is also a smart choice.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for the best weapon loadouts to use in Call of Duty, we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/">recommended weapon builds for multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-warzone-best-weapon-loadouts-for-bo6-season-1/2900-5959/">Warzone</a>.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded recently added new multiplayer maps, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-merry-mayhem-all-event-rewards/2900-6018/">Merry Mayhem holiday event</a>, and the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/bo6-zombies-how-to-complete-the-story-easter-egg-for-citadelle-des-morts/2900-6047/">Citadelle des Morts map for Zombies</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. But this drop isn't a crossover with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel</a> or packed with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">retro game vibes</a>. It is part of a new experiment being conducted by the tabletop company, a Secret Lair spin-off known as the Chaos Vault.</p>



<p>The announcement of the Chaos Vault Secret Lair drop was understated. There is a single <a href="https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1866177659492843768" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from the official <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> account. It simply reads, "The Vault Opens. Chaos Reigns." in block capitals alongside artwork and a link.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chaos-vault-estrid-the-masked-screenshot.jpg?itok=d-w0jhuf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chaos-vault-estrid-the-masked-screenshot.jpg?itok=SoLDXy7e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/1107223/the-fairest-drop-of-all-foil-edition" rel="nofollow">store page</a> has a bit more information. The drop is called The Fairest Drop of All and the description states that it will operate differently from other Secret Lair drops.</p>

<p>First, there is only one version of the drop available: in foil. Second, orders are limited to one per customer, possibly to deter mass purchases by scalpers. Third, the drop is noticeably cheaper compared to other foil Secret Lair drops, being sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p>

<p>As for what is in the Chaos Vault drop, it contains four foil reversible cards: <em>Estrid's Invocation</em>, <em>Steely Resolve</em>, <em>Estrid, the Masked,</em> and <em>Tuvasa, the Sunlit</em>. All four cards feature alternative artwork by artists Jessica Hische, Simen Meyer, Yehrin Tong, and Teagan White.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chaos-vault-steely-resolve-artwork.jpg?itok=5X9oD2Ks 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chaos-vault-steely-resolve-artwork.jpg?itok=KamiZSwX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the artwork, they all appear to be elaborate titles presented in an Art Deco style. The most elaborate of the cards is <em>Tuvasa, the Sunlit, </em>which gets the full profile treatment.</p>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing if this is the Chaos Vault drop of many. If the name is any indication, the artstyle or cards chosen may not be consistent either. As such, the appeal of these drops may hinge on novelty, scarcity, and fear of missing out. Only time will tell just how chaotic these drops will get.</p>

<p>Rocksteady is officially ending support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. In a post on the <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>, it was announced that Season 4 will see the final updates for Suicide Squad moving forward. </p>



<p>Those updates include the addition of Deathstroke along with a new medieval-themed Elseworld, new gear, and an offline mode. The offline mode will be available on December 10 alongside the rest of Season 4 episode 7.</p>



<p>“Offline mode will allow you to experience content released for the game, including the main story campaign and all seasonal story mission content, without an internet connection,” Rocksteady said. “To access Offline mode, you can either create a new profile by starting from the beginning of the game or create a copy of your existing Online profile, allowing you to jump in with all of your progress.”</p>



<p>The final Suicide Squad update will come with Episode 8 in January 2025. That wraps up the promised full year of updates for the game from Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Despite the updates ending, Rocksteady says that all online features will remain available, including online co-op and all previous seasonal/episodic content. It’s unclear if critical support updates will still come after regular updates are over.</p>



<p>The ending of updates for Suicide Squad brings to a close a controversial era for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games. After being delayed into 2024, the game launched with issues that causes it to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily pulled in early access</a>. From there, Warner Bros. Games revealed that not only did the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform below expectations</a>, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost them $200 million</a> in revenue.</p>



<p>Rocksteady even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a round of layoffs</a> after the launch of the game.</p>



<p>What do you think of updates to Suicide Squad ending after Season 4? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>
Seven months after announcing development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> - and a little over a year since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last major 2.1 release</a> - CD Projekt has revealed its open-world sci-fi RPG is getting more "cool stuff" in a suprise new update soon.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589">broke the news on social media</a>, revealing Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update will be detailed more thoroughly in a <a href="https://t.co/Pd1ztyTLTu">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/TOS9HhqLi9">YouTube</a> livestream airing Tuesday, 10th December, at 4pm GMT. As to what the update will include, that remains a mystery, but global community director Marcin Momot went some way toward managing expectations in a <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866161075281863141">separate post</a>.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of questions about whether <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support and NG+ are coming with Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 2.2," he wrote. "The answer is no. We do have some other cool stuff in the oven and we'll talk about it tomorrow during the stream — we hope you'll like it too!"

<p>
This isn't the first time CD Projekt has poured cold water on fan hopes for a PS5 Pro spruce-up, of course. The studio confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro">had "no plans" to release an update for Sony's console</a> back in November. But if PS5 Pro and New Game Plus are out, what could 2.2 bring?
</p><p>
It's likely it'll primarily focus on fixes and minor quality of life updates for issues identified during CD Projekt's work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Cyberpunk 2077's Mac port</a>, which arrives next year. Anything more substantial seems doubtful, given the majority of the studio is currently focused on its new Witcher game - now officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">in "full-scale production"</a> - but we'll know more tomorrow.

<p>It could be a matter of days until we’re treated to the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer from Rockstar Games, and the community is<strong> </strong>writhing in anticipation. We’ve heard nothing for more than a year, since the launch of the game’s initial trailer, and fans are <strong>starving </strong>for more GTA 6 content from the famed developer.</p>



<p>Recently, ‘GTA VI’ was spotted on the PlayStation store available to add to wishlists, but it’s not the game you’re hoping for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-art-of-creative-excuses">‘The Art of Creative Excuses’</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages VI</a> is a satirical title from Violarte that’s set to launch in May 2025, per a listing on the PlayStation store. The game’s presence was spotted recently by eagle-eyed users, and while it seems unlikely it’s <strong>real</strong>, it’s accompanied by a product description that’s worth a read.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most anticipated game about making the most anticipated game!</p>



<div><p>You’re now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster… Or masterpiece?</p><p>Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>At first blush, Grand Taking Ages VI (GTA VI) reads like a game dev simulator – which already exists in a few forms. The bio stresses that Grand Taking Ages VI is inspired ‘by real gaming industry events’.</p>



<p>It’ll feature a rags-to-riches story that sees players start in a ‘tiny apartment’ before expanding and growing as their creations succeed on the open market. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to tell if the game is real to any extent – and it probably isn’t – but it’s a funny jab at the wait we’re all struggling with where GTA 6 is concerned.</p>



<p>It’s also far from being the first copycat or parody game to surface on the PlayStation Store. Most recently, a rip-off title mimicking Gray Zone Warfare appeared on the PS Store.</p>
