		<p>IO Interactive has ended a collaboration with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrxl00151o">a court ruling in the Irish High Court</a> found that he assaulted and raped a women in 2018.</p>
<p>Releasing a statement on <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">social media</a>, IO said that they will remove content featuring McGregor from Hitman: World of Assassination from today:</p>


<p>“In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today.”</p>
<p>McGregor’s voice and likeness was used for a character named The Disruptor, one of the Elusive Targets in the recent Hitman games. These time limited missions and scenarios rotate in and out of the game to provide shifting challenges to players, giving you just one attempt at a target during its availability. The Disruptor mssion debuted in July of this year, &nbsp;had recently been brought back as the current Elusive Target and was meant to be available until 8th December, but is being pulled early.</p>
<p>In addition to this mission, a Disruptor DLC pack was sold giving permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring the character, as well as offering outfits, items, and cosmetics for the Freelancer mode HQ.</p>

<p>McGregor was found guilty by the jury in the civil case last week, who found that he had sexually assaulted a woman, Ms Hand, in a Dublin hotel six years ago. As a civil case, McGregor won’t face a jail sentence, but has been ordered to pay €248,000 in damages.</p>
<p>McGregor has stated that he will appeal the verdict.</p>

Humanoid Origin, the studio founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson in 2021, is ending development of its untitled sci-fi game and shutting its doors, after an "an unexpected shortfall of funding left [it] unable to sustain operations."
</p>
<p>
Hudson, who also served as BioWare general manager before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-announce-departure-from-bioware">departing the studio</a> in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-boss-announces-new-studio-working-on-fresh-ip">announced</a> the establishment of <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/">Humanoid Origin</a> (initially Humanoid Studios) in June 2021, teasing it was working on an "all-new IP". A year later, Hudson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudson-working-on-all-new-science-fiction-universe">shared a little more information</a> on the "multi-platform AAA game", as well as early concept art, calling it a "character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe".
</p>
<p>
Today, however, Hudson <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/">released a statement</a> announcing the project's termination and the closure of the studio. "Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down," he wrote. "Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations."
</p>
<p>
"We're heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion," Hudson continued. "Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. 
</p>
<p>
"In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey."
</p>
<p>
Humanoid Origin is the latest studio to be impacted in what continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">over 14,000 people estimated to have lost their jobs</a> so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023. Back in March, GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Tring, writing for Eurogamer, took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">closer look</a> at the circumstances leading to such massive numbers of job cuts over the last few years.

		<p>Humanoid Origin, the game studio set up Mass Effect game director Casey Hudson, has shut down before being able to ship a game due to a lack of a funding. This means all staff that were working at Humanoid Origin have been made redundant. A full statement has been released by Humanoid Origin, which can be read below.</p>

"THEY COOKED SO HAAARD"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and in case you're wondering about the "pissed on the moon" thing: there was a shot in the trailer of a laser being shot at the moon, which many have taken as a reference to a famous Sonic meme. In a popular YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A45CznHpEzk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SnapCube</a> (NSFW audio at that link), a man dubs over for Dr. Robotnik in a cutscene from Sonic Adventure 2, saying he would urinate on the moon as a laser hits it. Look, there's a lot of lore in the Sonic fanbase and not all of it makes sense, but that's what we love about it.

                <p>Earlier this month, a report emerged that Microsoft was forming a new committee within Activision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">guide the future of the Call of Duty franchise</a>. Now, that future may be coming into focus as a new report suggests that Sledgehammer Games will be taking the lead on Call of Duty's 2027 release. </p><p>TheGhostOfHope--a Call of Duty leaker who has accurately reported on previous developments in the franchise--is reporting that Sledgehammer Games' next Call of Duty game will follow Infinity Ward's 2026 title, "which is presumably [Modern Warfare 4]." Hope also stated that Sledgehammer Games' COD is possibly Advanced Warfare 2 or "something new."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/theghostofhope/status/1860508353958498481?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I am hearing about Sledgehammer Games future with Call of Duty:<br>Sledgehammer Games are currently slated to lead their own Call Of Duty in 2027.

The publisher credits Black Ops 6's availability on Game Pass, consoles, and PC for lifting its 30-day launch period to all-time highs in total players, total hours played, and total matches played. The game also added some fresh touches to the franchise, including DLC that gives players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-now-lets-you-become-a-muscly-shark/1100-6528027/" data-ref-id="1100-6528027">the ability to suit up as a shark</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spire-of-dioronna-card-game-based-on-3-body-problem-now-live-on-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A S<em>pire of Dioronna</em> board game has gone live on Kickstarter. This card game is based on the <em>3 Body Problem</em> novel series written by Liu Cixin, which was recently given a streaming series adaptation on Netflix. Specifically, it focuses on a single character from those books.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <em>Spire of Dioronna </em>is a modular map escape card game. It is based on Dioronna, a <em>3 Body Problem: Death's End</em> character. Dioronna was a prostitute in the time of the Byzantine Empire who, through the aid of a high-dimensional fragment, attempted to help Constantine kill the leader of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spire-of-dioronna-board-game-set-up.jpg?itok=9K-51H41 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spire-of-dioronna-board-game-set-up.jpg?itok=gn3PJCCx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players in the game are students in a wizard school who uncover a tome that recorded the life of Dioronna. In addition, the spire in the school may be the same one where Dioronna practiced her craft. But once you and your fellow students enter the spire the items and the room shatter apart.</p>

<p>If you want to escape this predicament, you must work together. Players take turns drawing room cards from a deck and slowly building a map. The objective is to find three unique magic items, a wizard hat, a cat, and a key, then find the exit. <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> is designed for 2-4 players and a single game takes about 20-40 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>There are several pledge tiers for <em>Spire of Dioronna</em>. The different pledge tiers are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Early Bird for $29:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game at a reduced price. This tier is limited and is available on a first-come-first-serve basis</li>
	<li><strong>Kickstarter Special for $35:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Double Pack for $49:</strong> Two copies of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Newqz 2 Game Special for $49:</strong> A copy of <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> and a copy of the game <em>Crow Drinks Water</em></li>
	<li><strong>Five-Pack for $119:</strong> Five copies of the game.</li>
</ul><p>Please note the prices of these pledge tiers do not take into account taxes or shipping costs. Costs which <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">may be going up</a> for those living in the US.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> Kickstarter campaign has raised <span><span>$8,780, almost tripling its initial funding goal of $3,000. The campaign concludes December 12.</span></span></p>

Thankfully, alongside the freeform building mechanics, the game does feature a rather large suite of blueprints you can plop down easily. Even better is the slew of new mechanics, like procedural weather, waterparks, and more streamlined park management tools to help you run a bustling amusement park more efficiently.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,196358,195922" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On launch, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> managed to settle somewhere in the middle of the road, with “Mixed” reviews on Steam. Overall, the park management and simulation game is just shy of obtaining a “Mostly Positive” score, but there are a few hang-ups preventing players from leaning that way. First and foremost, it appears the game’s performance was lacking on release. I’ve encountered a few issues firsthand, primarily with guest AI refusing to queue up for a ride and instead forming a massive blockade.</p><p>Even amongst the game’s more positive reviews, however, most don’t attempt to hide the game’s various issues. The positive reviews point out performance troubles, UI issues are another problem and, above all else, AI woes. But for the most part, players seem happy with the depth and additional content over the last game. The waterparks, especially, prove entertaining. After spending a little time building a flume, I can see why. It’s a whole new layer to consider when designing your dream park!</p><p>As for the negative reviews, there are many. Most point to a half-finished experience rushed to release, the upcoming DLC practices that Frontier is known for, and frustrating performance. But most importantly, they indicate missing features, like Steam Workshop support and the lack of security and vandalism mechanics which were prevalent in the previous game. </p><p>If you’re on the fence about picking up<em> Planet Coaster 2</em>, here’s a look at the game’s Steam user reviews for more insight!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="f96111411f32796d3354da93fdc7bbd9"

<p>ASKA Major Update Three, known as Servers &amp; Roads, is now available on the stable branch for all fans of the third-person crafting survival game with town-building mechanics. It’s a big one, too. Alongside the inclusion of dedicated servers, update three features in-game text chat, graphical improvements, path-making mechanics, and so much more. It’s a huge boon to anyone still enjoying the survival game!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-aska-update-3-servers-amp-roads">Everything New in Aska Update 3 Servers &amp; Roads</h2>







<h3 id="h-dedicated-servers">Dedicated Servers</h3>



<p>You can now host and join dedicated servers in ASKA via a server application under the tools category in your Steam library.

Amazon's intriguing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Secret Level anthology series</a> is almost upon, bringing 15 episodes of brand-new stories set in familiar video game worlds. And following on from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">recent series trailer</a>, Amazon is now releasing individual teasers for each episode, offering a closer look at the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, and, of course, that posthumous turn for Concord.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if it's so far managed to pass you by, comes from the creative team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>’s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots. Like that show, Secret Level is all about the flashy CGI animation, but here, episodes draw inspiration from existing video games - featuring familiar settings and characters in new adventures - rather than sci-fi tales.
</p>
<p>
Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, Spelunky, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40K, plus a number of PlayStation Studios games all feature in Secret Level's inaugural season, and we've seen brief glimpses of at least some of these already. However, as part of its big pre-release push, Amazon is now highlighting each individual episode on social media, publishing brisk 20-second-long teaser trailers revealing a little more than what's been shown before.

Concord, above, is arguably the most fascinating of these, if only because it effectively serves as an unanticipated eulogy for Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">ill-fated 5v5 shooter Concord</a> - in an episode Secret Level creator Tim Miller recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">showed the "potential of this world and the characters"</a>. But there's more too, with Amazon also sharing a look at <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1858533196943520132">The Queen's Cradle</a>, based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, as well as Sifu's <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1858895581684339092">It Takes a Life</a>, Unreal Tournament's <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859258173858709977">Xan</a>, the Spelunky themed <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859620355314213027">Tally</a>, plus <a href="https://x.com/SecretLevelonPV/status/1859982744383590403">And They Shall Know No Fear</a> - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">sequel</a> to the events of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.

You can also find discounts on lesser-known gems like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2FY9H73?tag=theverge02-20"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, which is on sale for $40 in one of its first major sales. </p><div><p>Hardware discounts can be rare, but there are sizable savings to be had across the board, whether you’re after a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-1TB-Digital-Edition-Robot-White-Wireless-Controller-Includes-2-Controllers-Up-120-frames-per-second-16-GB-RAM-Memory-1-TB-SSD-Storage-E%2F13244064652">Xbox Series X</a>, a <a href="https://howl.link/txqo13bekf7uh?u1=vergebfsales2024">Nintendo Switch</a>, or even a Steam Deck alternative like the <a href="https://howl.link/qg3p8njgieaii">Asus ROG Ally X</a>.

The heavy-hitting story is less noticeable, though, and there’s a lot to unpack as you play through the medieval-era, turn-based RPG.</p></div><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>is the culmination of everything Remedy Entertainment has been building toward. The inventive third-person survival game is both horrifying and strange, with dual campaigns that are more than a little meta.</p></div><div><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is the latest installment in the <em>Zelda </em>franchise. The storyline and gameplay are similar to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s<em>, </em>but enough has changed to make Link’s return to Hyrule plenty special. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><ul><li><em><strong>NBA 2K25</strong></em> is down to an all-time low of $29.99 ($40 off) at Amazon for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96QNZWH?tag=theverge02-20">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96RBDVX?tag=theverge02-20">Xbox Series X / S</a>. That deal is timely for those currently enjoying the first quarter of the pro basketball season. Overall, the simulation dribbler will feel familiar to longtime series vets, but among other key tweaks, MyPlayer’s improved Neighborhood experience cuts back on required travel, and you’ll no longer lose badge levels while taking extended breaks from the game.  </li><li>You can get a PS5 copy of <em><strong>Madden NFL 25</strong></em> for $25 ($45 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/35t1wbn2gl04n">Best Buy</a>, which is the lowest price we’ve seen so far. The <a href="https://howl.link/zyqqd2r4bekc3">Series X / S version</a> is also on sale for $29.99 ($40 off).

			<p>If you're dipping your toes into the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular MOBA</a>, League of Legends, you'll notice that there are a few roles for you to try out in Summoner's Rift. If you want to try your hand at jungling, you'll need to get to grips with the best routes for clearing, how to gank your opponents, and how to shot call on essential things like taking the Dragon or doing Baron Nashor. However, before you can think about that, you need to choose a jungler. Here are some of the best junglers to choose from if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out more of our League of Legends guides here:</p>

<h2>Best Beginner Junglers in League of Legends</h2>
<p>Jungling can be quite tricky to get a handle on, especially as you are responsible for maintaining your health, mana and dealing enough damage to kill jungle camps efficiently on your own. On top of that, you have to juggle responsibilities such as warding, having a good lane presence, and overthrowing the enemy jungler. If you want to try your hand at being a jungler, here are some of the best for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Amumu</strong> is a great jungler to start with, regardless of what season it is. Not only does he have a lot of ganking capability, but he has a relatively smooth camp clear. Typically, with Amumu, you start at Raptors using your E so that you don't have to get a leash from either the top or bottom lane. This means that the lane that would be helping you doesn't miss out on vital early-game minions, and you can get your early-game camps with minimal issues. Amumu has great crowd control, with his Q stunning the enemy and pulling Amumu to the opponent, and his Ultimate stuns everyone who is in the circle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Nocturne</strong> is incredibly fun and has the potential to snowball and hypercarry if you play him correctly. He can be a bit difficult to get to grips with, but he has a ton of potential. It would be best if you found the balance between getting farm and ganking lanes to be able to be a threat to the opponent. One of the keys to being able to be a good Nocturne is using your Ultimate to gank an ally and help them pick off their lane opponent. Getting those assists in any time your Ultimate is up is key.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sejuani</strong> also has a lot of potential this season and is relatively easy to learn. If you don't like the idea of being a squishy jungler, Sejuani is perfect to pick. She gets quite tanky and can survive team fights and lane ganks with ease, especially with the aid of her crowd control. Of course, like any jungler, you need to make sure you find the balance between farming and ganking. However, she has a lot of defensive options with her knockback, her Ultimate, and the slows that come with it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No matter the season,&nbsp;<strong>Vi</strong> remains viable. She has a lot of damage potential and is more of a bruiser than a tank jungler. She has great damage output and camp clear, with added mobility in her Q. With how her Ultimate and Q work, it makes it easy for Vi to gank a lane. However, due to the skill shot nature of her Q, it can be difficult to land the hit on a champion, especially if they move unpredictably. Despite that, Vi is a lot of fun and has great potential if she can get ahead.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best beginner junglers you can try out in League of Legends right now. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>

There, you’ll encounter a handful of characters who will help propel the story forward, along with merchants, technicians, and even your first up close and personal interaction with a faction. You’ll also need money—well, coupons in this universe. You’ll find Mityay arguing with another Stalker in the merchant’s shop, and if you choose to accept his quest, he’ll send you to a dangerous anomaly field known as the Poppy Field. It’s gorgeous and deadly in equal measures.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h88690"><a id=""></a>‘The Poppy Field’ Walkthrough</h2><p>Mityay asks for your help retrieving a family religious icon left behind on their plot of land, buried in a root cellar beneath the Poppy Field. But he warns you about this area: It’s dangerous. The Poppy Field is a singular anomaly that forces Stalkers to fall asleep and never wake up. He suggests you bring along energy drinks, and you should. You’ll require approximately eight to survive the anomaly.</p><figure id="" data-id="758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-recommend-id="image://758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stalker Pomor hides out by the Poppy Field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Stalker Pomor hides out by the Poppy Field." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-recommend-id="image://758e2a65acaa895bb2a9d083a1eed4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stalker Pomor hides out by the Poppy Field." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Upon arriving at The Poppy Field to the northwest of Zalissya, you’ll encounter a few mutants, but more importantly, a voice comes over the radio, urging you to meet them at the nearby house to the northeast of the field. Once there, you’ll encounter Pomor, a lone and mysterious Stalker who requests your help. He knows where to find the root cellar but requires your assistance entering the field. You can either pay him 2,000 coupons or help him recover the weapons and ammunition from multiple bodies marked within the field. If you choose the latter, you’ll need some energy drinks. You’ll need one to reach the body and then one to return. The last two drinks are for the root cellar. They’re mostly a precaution, though. Depending on how much you panic, you might only use one drink per body.</p><p>The final house at the southwest portion of the field contains two bodies, one in the central room and one in the rear bedroom, so don’t panic while you avoid the petals. Keep a clear head, search both bodies and then exit swiftly.</p><figure id="" data-id="78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-recommend-id="image://78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows Pomor’s tasks at The Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows Pomor’s tasks at The Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-recommend-id="image://78193c6e806ed5962e2503632c60a2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows Pomor’s tasks at The Poppy Field in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s important to note that you don’t have to help Pomor, though.

It’s a broken yet extremely powerful early-game weapon that will serve you well after you pay for repairs.</li><li><strong>Trade the Icon, Kill Pomor, Return to Mityay</strong>: Lastly, you can trade the religious icon to Pomor, receive the rifle as a reward, then turn around and shoot him to retrieve the icon and return it to Mityay for his reward. </li></ul><p>At the end of the day, this is the Zone. No one will judge you for double-crossing a shady Stalker you met out there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I often think about the era when Grand Theft Auto games were coming out almost every year rather than once a decade or so. In those off years, there were a lot of games that tried to fill the void for players wanting an open-world crime-drama game: True Crime, Saints Row, Mafia, Scarface, Crackdown--the list goes on. Presumably, no one making these games thought they would dethrone Rockstar. Still, they understood they could capitalize on the genre's popularity by giving players a new lookalike while Rockstar was busy cooking up the next GTA. Since 2017's Sniper Elite 4, I've viewed the Sniper Elite series as something similar, only in this case, the series it's filling in for is Hitman. Rebellion's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/" data-ref-id="5000-640579">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> won't outdo IO Interactive's incredible Hitman series, and it doesn't even seem to do much differently compared to the last few games in its own series, but if you've enjoyed this sort of game before and are eager for another one, Sniper Elite: Resistance looks to be a reliable proxy.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently played about 90 minutes of the game's third mission before its debut in January on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S, when it will also be a day-one Game Pass launch. Even as I strained to find much in the way of new experiences, I had a fun time. That suggests that this sixth game in the series, and the first since 2022, is roughly as enjoyable as the last couple of entries--at least from what I've seen so far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405385-ser_announcement_09_fort_c_sights.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405385-ser_announcement_09_fort_c_sights.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405385"></a><figcaption>Pictured: politics in games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405385-ser_announcement_09_fort_c_sights.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Hitman, levels are huge and open-ended regarding where you can go and how you can complete your objectives when you get there. In recent sequels, Rebellion has built in more creative kills reminiscent of Agent 47's handiwork, such as hiding a grenade in wrapping paper for a target to unwrap, or killing Hitler with a bowling pin. Each mission includes a main objective and several optional objectives of a few different kinds. There are intel collectibles you can gather, ally hideouts to locate, things like enemy weapons depots to blow up, and usually a high-value target to snuff out, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The sandbox-style fun of it all is deciding how you do that, whether it's by sneaking past everyone and exfiltrating before anyone knew you were there, or going loud and aiming for the groins of every Nazi who comes into view of your scope. Some players will prefer to mainline the campaign, but I've long found Sniper Elite to be one of the better series at enticing me to clear each map of all its different mission markers, and as a stealth experience especially, I've always enjoyed the challenges they put in front of me.</p><p dir="ltr">Even with just 90 minutes to play the preview build of the game, I couldn't help but investigate every optional objective I came across. Once, when I was nearing the end of a main objective, I'd suddenly realized what I'd overlooked when seeking a secret ally hideout about an hour earlier in the level, so I ditched the elaborate Nazi mansion I was sneaking through, trekked all the way back to an earlier section past the dead fascists I'd left in my wake, to climb the side of a building using the drain pipe and some ledges so I could finally check that side quest off my list. Sniper Elite gives you a vast playground to explore, offers many viable routes through it, and doesn't punish you for handling it all in the order and manner of your choosing. In a world without Agent 47 for the foreseeable future, I'll gladly accept this Historical Hitman in his absence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405386-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_21b-%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405386" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405386-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_21b-%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405386"></a><figcaption>Sniper Elite's sharpshooting gameplay run deep, but its best attribute is its sprawling levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405386-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_21b-%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I've played all of these games, and though the next one to really blow me away would also be the first one, none have been bad. The studio seems to think better of its signature X-ray bullet cam than I do--in Sniper Elite 5, I eventually turned it off so it wouldn't keep slowing down my missions--but I'm still otherwise very much into the format of these games. Both level to level and game to game, they become a kind of even-keeled comfort-food experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Like cooking your favorite meal for the fourth time in a week, you know what you're getting with Sniper Elite. It may not dazzle you with new flavors that have never graced your tongue, but it's a reliable go-to when you don't know what to make for dinner that night. I don't mean to damn the game with faint praise; I sincerely enjoy these games and gladly try a new one every few years at their current pace.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say this sequel is totally void of new experiences. The broad strokes are certainly very familiar, but one aspect Rebellion is adding--which I didn't get to see in my time with the game so far--are Propaganda missions, which cast players as "resistance fighters," giving the game's massive levels more replayability in the form of new objectives on subsequent playthroughs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405389-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_16.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="7680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405389-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_16.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405389"></a><figcaption>The slow-motion X-ray camera isn't a selling point for me after so many entries, but the mechanics around it remain satisfying.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405389-ser_screenshots_releasedate_prologuealps_16.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This will also be the first game in the series to cast a hero other than Karl Fairburne, the square-jawed alpha American, as the playable protagonist. Instead, it turns to Harry Hawker, a British soldier who has been in past games, but usually as the backup character for those playing the campaign in co-op. That will give this chapter in the story a different voice, but the lack of a number in this game's title and the fact that Hawker's story takes place at the same time as Fairburne's in Sniper Elite 5 also suggest this is overtly a continuation of what worked well before. Rebellion is keeping things in France for now rather than moving the series to a new country like sequels in this series have tended to. If Sniper Elite is the comfort food series, Resistance is like enjoying a second plate of what you scarfed down earlier. If you're still hungry, eat up.</p>

                <p>The biggest goal Epic Games has with Fortnite Creative is to transform Fortnite into a platform for games that share little to no resemblance with its core battle royale mode. Independent creators--while perhaps still a long ways off from making Creative's breakout game--have started to do just that.</p><p>Creator duuk has built a 10-player free-for-all <a href="https://fortnite.gg/island?code=9756-5951-6748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Creative map</a> that replicates the beloved wallrunning mechanic of other first-person shooters such as the Titanfall series. The 19-year-old, Netherlands-based creator is one of the first to implement this type of mechanic in Fortnite Creative.</p><p>You can find the map by searching in the Discover tab with the following code: 9756-5951-6748.</p><p>Players are immediately shifted to a first-person point of view once they load into the map. They have the ability to practice the wallrunning mechanic in a small training area before loading into the full map, which resembles a warehouse lot.</p><p>The mechanic feels nowhere near as smooth or responsive as it does in games like Titanfall 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, although it's still an interesting experience to combine the wallrunning with other Fortnite mechanics like mantling and items like shockwave grenades.</p><p>Wallrunning has been rumored as an upcoming mechanic for Fortnite's battle royale mode for at least a year, as YouTube and TikTok videos have hinted that future chapters and seasons would include it to complement the mantling and climbing system. Despite the rumors, no wallrunning feature has ever been officially mentioned by Epic Games.</p><p>Movement has been one of Fortnite's most-enjoyable features as the battle royale development team has continued to iterate and build on the game's traversal mechanics with special items that give players incredible abilities. Players have been bounced off the ground with the Shockwave Hammer, dashed through the sky with the Kinetic Blade, and soared above the clouds Iron-Man gauntlets over previous seasons.</p><p>The base movement system within Fortnite's third-person mode has evolved over the course of the game's five chapters (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-start-date-battle-pass-skins-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-5955/" data-ref-id="2900-5955">Fortnite Chapter 6</a> launches soon). Previous updates have added and refined sprinting, mantling, climbing, and sliding mechanics that have transformed the shooter into something that looks nothing like the survival game that Fortnite originally launched as in 2017.</p><p>Many of the features found in the battle royale mode can be used by players in Creative, although copyright restrictions prevent things like the Spider-Man gauntlets from making the crossover without receiving a generic rebranding.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4405376-img_6014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405376" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4405376-img_6014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405376"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4405376-img_6014.jpg"></figure><p>We haven't seen many fluid movement mechanics in Creative, but players are beginning to push that boundary as well. This map is duuk's first full release, as they put it, within the Fortnite Creative ecosystem. Mechanics and game types tend to spread like wildfire in Creative if a map featuring them gets popular. It's too early to tell now, but both duuk and other creators could continue to refine wallrunning in future maps and updates.</p><p>Although wallrunning is the signature feature of duuk's map, it also distinguishes itself from the standard Fortnite experience through the aforementioned first-person perspective. While a first-person mode has been teased for battle royale in the past, an experimental mode only came to Creative users in <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-first-person-now-available-as-an-experimental-feature-in-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">October 2024</a>. The feature, as the experimental tag would suggest, is still in its early stages and does not include all weapons, use cases, and player features that Fortnite' standard third-person mode includes.</p><p>Fortnite Creative has been slowly evolving since Epic Games announced a new way to create with Unreal Editor for Fortnite, which expands creator tools through further integration with Unreal Engine. The ability to use different camera angles, including a top-down view, give creators an opportunity to build experiences that feel completely different from the battle royale mode. Wallrunning is a beloved game mechanic thanks to many shooters that have come before--these creators are adding to a short chapter to its history with this Creative map.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has been a massive success for Larian Studios. It won Game Of The Year at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2023-winners-revealed/2900-4977/">2023's The Game Awards</a>, and over a year after its initial launch, Larian is still pushing out game updates and gaining fans all over the globe (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mods-help-player-numbers-grow-and-someone-in-the-vatican-just-bought-a-copy/1100-6527834/">including in the Vatican</a>). But a recent report from the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html" rel="nofollow ">Irish Independent</a> has revealed that the game wasn't just a hit with players--it was also a massive financial success, raking in roughly $260 million in profits in 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the figures shared by the Independent, Larian earned a total of $466 million in revenue in 2023, nearly 20 times what the studio earned in 2022. The massive success of Baldur's Gate 3 clearly had a major hand in the studio's financial success, and although Larian has yet to release the game's sales numbers, the Independent cites 15 million copies sold. 2023 marked a major change for the studio, which was operating at a $223,000 loss in 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the game's success is likely due to its sheer level of replayability. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">Players can mod the game</a> to their heart's content (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-rolls-out-baldurs-gate-3-mod-limitations-for-console-players/1100-6528031/" data-ref-id="1100-6528031">even on console</a>) and play through the story as their own original player-character, or step into the shoes of the game's companions and play as one of them. For those looking to wreak havoc on Faerûn, there's the Dark Urge character origin option, and players who wish to bring others into their adventures can make use of the game's robust online multiplayer mode or split-screen couch co-op, all for a single $70 purchase. No microtransactions, no DLC, and seemingly infinite content might explain why the game now sees <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3-defies-the-laws-of-physics-by-being-a-single-player-rpg-with-more-daily-users-in-2024-than-its-release-year/" rel="nofollow ">more daily users in 2024 than it did in 2023</a>--an <em>extremely</em> rare occurrence when it comes to single-player RPGs.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the future, Larian CEO Swen Vincke says the studio has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/">no current plans to start work on Baldur's Gate 4</a> (for now), but the team behind the best RPG of 2023 is currently laying the groundwork for a new that Vincke says he hopes will take players by surprise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/">and "dwarf" Baldur's Gate 3</a> by comparison.</p><p>"Hopefully nobody's going to leak it for us, but it's different than what you think it is," Vincke <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-game-and-discusses-decision-to-not-make-baldurs-gate-4/1100-6522165/">said of the untitled RPG</a>. "But it is still familiar enough for you to recognize that it's something that we are making."</p>

                <p>Humanoid Origin, a new studio founded by Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson, is closing up shop.

"In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity," the statement said. "We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship.
