Will that 20-year-old copy of a game you love still be playable? Probably not considering that of the big three, Nintendo has the worst track record for keeping digital storefronts up and running. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-classic-games-mario-zelda-eshop-shop-1848544931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-classic-games-mario-zelda-eshop-shop-1848544931">Go try to buy a Wii U or 3DS digital game</a></span>. </p><p>So naturally people have been digging through store listings to try and nail down what games are and aren’t using Game Key Cards.

But the Switch 2's absence from Amazon was an expected continuation of a story that has been unfolding over the past year.

Walmart's online storefront experienced the same shift--though brick-and-mortar stores still stocked Nintendo games on launch day. Later in the year, Walmart started selling Nintendo exclusives online in the days leading up to a game's launch. Everything with Walmart and Nintendo returned to normal this year, which is why the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=You+Won%27t+Find+Switch+2+Consoles+On+Amazon%2C+But+You+Can+Get+Games+%26+Gear&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-25+13%3A32%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-25+13%3A33%3A02&amp;fnarticle_id=6531143&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fswitch-2-hardware-and-software%2Fc2hlbGZfaWQ6NzQzMzY4OAieie%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear%2F1100-6531143%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 and all of its Nintendo-made games and accessories are available at Walmart</a>.</p><h3>Why did Amazon stop carrying first-party Nintendo products?</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4483133-newamazonimg3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4483133-newamazonimg3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483133"></a><figcaption>Sorry, Mario, you can't preorder the Switch 2 at Amazon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4483133-newamazonimg3.jpg"></figure><p>The short answer is: No one knows for sure, but Amazon almost certainly <em>wants </em>to sell Nintendo products. Neither Nintendo nor Amazon has offered a reason for the dissolution of their retail partnership, but we have a theory based on the fact that Amazon and Walmart were the only retailers impacted by Nintendo stock woes last year. Both retailers have a history of offering discounts on Nintendo games and accessories outside of official Nintendo sales. As in, Switch games were often discounted for long stretches of time, to the point that getting a $10 discount on a first-party game felt like the norm. Ever since Walmart's Nintendo situation reversed course, most of the first-party game deals we see there are sold by third parties.</p><p>Today, you can find the aforementioned 2024 Nintendo games on Amazon, but they are third-party listings that pop up at launch. You'll also find a wide selection of region-free Nintendo games on Woot, an Amazon-owned discount shop. Woot has made a habit of listing Nintendo's games on launch day with $10 discounts. This practice didn't start until after Amazon stopped selling Nintendo games, so read into that as you see fit. And we'll have to wait and see if the trend continues when the Switch 2 launches on June 5.</p><h3>Amazon will still carry licensed Nintendo products</h3><p>The only Nintendo products you can't find on Amazon--shipped and sold by the retailer--are consoles, games, and accessories published by Nintendo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On paper, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> doesn’t seem to stand out amidst a recent wave of prestige RPGs, from the newly polished high fantasy of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda"><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remake</a> to the medieval warfare of 15th century Bohemia in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. </em>For one, its fantastical conquests are set in a world reminiscent of France’s Belle Époque period, an era known for its economic prosperity and radical artistic movements, from Art Nouveau to Expressionism. Add a tinge of melodrama and an emotional backstory, and its setting resembles a medley of games that take place in vaguely European worlds like <em>Greedfall</em>, <em>Bloodborne,</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. At the same time, <em>Expedition 33</em> boasts a turn-based combat system inspired by Japanese RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Ques</em>t.</p><p>All this is to say that <em>Expedition 33</em> risks appearing banal and cliche. Fending off impossible odds in a world, where everyone wants to swing their very imposing weapons at your head amidst medieval ruins, isn’t all that unique these days. But <em>Expedition 33</em> isn’t cowered by the lineage of RPGs that came before. Instead, it displays a sense of quiet confidence, understanding that the keys of the genre — narrative and combat — need to be distinct enough to weave a poignant tale.</p><p>This is embodied in the prologue, which takes its time to unfold the game’s emotional stakes. At the start you’re introduced to the scraggly-but-charismatic Gustav, who’s nervous about his meeting with ex-partner Sophie. Apart from going through the basics of combat, Gustav spends the first half of the chapter on a leisurely stroll with her along the town’s boulevard, as they make their way toward the harbor. It’s then that the game’s conceit is revealed: the Paintress, a malignant, immortal being of sorts, wakes up once a year to paint a number on a massive monolith, culling the town’s dwindling population. When this happens, everyone of that particular age simply dissipates into petals. It’s a moment that could easily tip into mawkishness, but a palpable feeling of melancholia sets in. A lump in your throat lingers.</p><p>This scene sets the tone for the rest of <em>Expedition 33</em>. You guide a group of doomed Expeditioners like Gustav, who are embarking on a last-ditch attempt to stop the Paintress. It would’ve been easy for <em>Expedition 33</em> to plunge into an never-ending cycle of abject hopelessness, but there’s a genuine sense of wonder in traveling beyond the small town of Lumiere, and toward the vast expanse of its larger, phantasmagoric world.</p><p>One landscape has towering pink corals and shimmering sea flora, swaying like underwater tendrils, with bubbling streams rising from the ground. Another showcases the remnants of Art Nouveau architecture, with dilapidated buildings rife with elegant curves and floral patterns, as well as marble faces carved onto their surfaces. It’s as if these lands, once rich with history and biodiversity, have long been wrecked by a cataclysmic war. Despite the looming threat of certain death, even the Expeditioners were awed by the painterly allure of their surroundings, almost thrilled to be on such a lustrous journey. </p><p>Equally — and unexpectedly — resplendent is the game’s combat. Encounters typically begin with the crew striking some monstrous titans with an initial, vibrant blow (or, in unlucky instances, with enemies walking into them), and being transported to a grandiose arena. These scenes are beautiful tableaus, with every attack depicted with the finesse and flourish of stylish sword fights.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em>’s turn-based combat appears deceptively straightforward. You can issue commands to each Expeditioner every turn, who have their own impressive set of moves. The backbone of Gustav’s attacks, for instance, is his prosthetic arm, which allows him to charge up his assaults and subsequently land a powerful finisher. Whereas another Expeditioner, Lune, embodies the mage archetype with several elemental spells at her disposal.</p><p>Adding a wrinkle to this turn-based formula is that enemy attacks can be dodged and parried. When timed right, this allows you to collect more action points for pulling off a string of attacks, or launching a countermove. Performing twitchy maneuvers like these are incredibly satisfying. A perfectly timed parry can easily turn the tide of combat, letting you deal a massive amount of damage. That’s not to say that battles are easy; executing these moves, at the right time, is contingent on your understanding of enemy movements, some of whom are prone to feigning their attacks. Most enemies even present their own twists to combat, which makes every tussle substantial.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Sandfall Interactive</cite></p></div><p>Adding some tactical diversity to combat are Pictos, which are items the Expeditioners can equip to buff their attacks. This is, by far, one of the smartest tricks <em>Expedition 33</em> has up its sleeve. There are plenty of these to collect across the map, so you can further customize each Expeditioner to a specific, preferred build. Gustav’s Overcharge, for instance, requires him to land a flurry of melee assaults to charge up the skill, so I prefer to equip him with Pictos that increase the potency of his attacks.</p><p>This is how <em>Expedition 33</em> lets you subtly refine the cadence of battles. And then there’s the joy of the grind; if an enemy proves to be too overwhelming, you can always plow through ramshackle bands of mechanical titans for experience points. That’s because the ritual of grinding in <em>Expedition 33</em> is deeply cerebral, rather than mindlessly tedious, with every encounter a sizable, yet surmountable challenge. Plus, swinging enormous swords and scythes at the heads of Expedition 33’s monstrous giants — accompanied by a rousing, atmospheric soundtrack — lets your attacks land with a really meaty thump. Fighting is a grand, stupendous affair.</p><p>There’s much more to say about the sheer extravagance of <em>Expedition 33</em>. Its characters carry shades of complexity and compassion that surface in their conversations. Its music swells and swirls with orchestral lavishness, punctuating every interaction with a note of majesty or calamity. Its tale is heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous in equal measure. Some parts of <em>Expedition 33 </em>can be a tad superfluous — like the need to put a numerical value in the Expeditioners’ relationships, and certain dialog choices that make little sense — but these do little to mar its experience.</p><p><em>Expedition 33</em> is built upon the conventional anchors of its genre. But its grandiose tale, bolstered by a downright robust combat system, turns it into something much more than just a scrappy underdog.</p><p><sub>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<em> is available now on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Re-reincarnation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you enjoyed NieR: Automata and its predecessor, NieR: Replicant, you could be forgiven for not knowing that game actually got a sequel, and a pretty good one too. Unfortunately, that sequel, mobile game NieR: Re[in]carnation, hasn't been available for almost a year after being taken offline in April of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fortunately, a Square Enix website is dropping some pretty wild in-universe hints that this might be about to change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalist Willa Rowe</a>, an official NieR website that's currently publishing a NieR special movel to commemorate the series 15th anniversary is teasing something NieR: Re[in]carnation-related via cryptic in-text hints and webpage source code. As a part of today's update to the novel, the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just-published chapter 4</a> ends with some strange text that reads as follows:</p><blockquote>[WARNING] : Recovery protocol initialized...[ERROR] : Redirecting to backup node: &lt; https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/ &gt;[INFO] : Analysis comments added to the source code.<br>[FATAL] : Process forcibly halted.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does THAT mean? Who knows? But wait, there's more. If you hit "View Source" on that page, there are even more weird teases in the code comments, as hinted at above. They read, in order:</p><blockquote>SECURITY NOTICE: Unauthorized transmission detected. Signal disruption logged. Countermeasure protocol active. Redirecting to backup node: <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/</a></blockquote><blockquote>TODO: Optimize rendering efficiency.

He is watching...Adjust access permissions before deployment. His name is............</blockquote><blockquote>HACK: Log discrepancy detected. Records indicate previous modification attempts due to excessive interference from The Cage. Cross-check against original transmission before proceeding.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, there's a lot here, some of which is inscrutable and some of which makes sense. "The Cage", for instance, is the main location where most of NieR: Re[in]carnation takes place. And "Her" is a key character (yes, that's Her name) in Re[in]carnation as well. Between that and the hyperlink, it's pretty obvious what all this is referencing, but what exactly will become of it remains anyone's guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two final chapters of the novel are scheduled to publish on May 2, a week from today, and it's possible it may also pull back the curtain on whatever's happening here. Fans are speculating that it may be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NieRReincarnation/comments/1k7l4ym/new_nier_15th_anniversary_web_novel_chapters_14/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading up to some sort of port or re-release of NieR: Re[in]carnation</a>, which has been completely unplayable anywhere since it went offline last year. They're also pointing out that the chapters of the special novel, which are currently only available in Japanese (but which fans are translating), have some pretty significant tie-ins to all three other NieR games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  NieR Reincarnation</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Re[in]carnation, I highly recommend keeping an eye on this, especially if the end result is another opportunity to play it. Re[in]carnation is a good game in its own right that many slept on due to its being a mobile gacha game, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">critically, it's also the direct sequel to NieR: Automata</a>, and effectively is NieR 3, for those who have been waiting for it. Who knows? Maybe a new Re[in]carnation release could include some new content that ties the ongoing stream of loose NieR-related threads together at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/deep-cuts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Few things underscore the differences between Rob and Patrick more than their approach to playing new video games, which is to say that Patrick is often spending his time with The Next Thing, while Rob continues to mine the past.</em></p><p><em>That split is part of what makes Remap what it is, though!</em></p><p><em>Plus, who doesn't want an excuse to talk about BioForge? Who isn't excited to potentially have Rob and Cado playing Myth II: Soulblighter co-op on stream? It's our Remember Some Games era and it's great.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So we talked about this on the podcast, but I’ve spent a decent chunk of this week playing <em>Myth: The Fallen Lords </em>and <em>Myth 2: Soulblighter</em>. They just had some amazing updates drop from the Project Magma team, who have basically been working to keep the <em>Myth </em>series playable for the last fifteen years. The new update is called the <em>Twice Born Edition </em>and it’s as close to a remaster as the game is likely to get.</p><p><em>Myth </em>is one of my all-time favorite games. There are countless games that channel or outright copy from Tolkien, but <em>Myth </em>is one of the few that I think fully understands how the Lord of the Rings experience should be translated into a game. Mission briefings are given via bleak, well-written journal entries that evoke the idea that the game itself is a found text, like the history the Fellowship finds in the depths of Moria. Unit descriptions are pieces of larger, unseen texts (a technique that would resurface with <em>Destiny’s </em>Grimoire), and that narrative device suggests a world of cultures, languages, and histories both known and lost to time.</p><p>The narrative points to epic battles happening off-screen but the game is not aiming to be a fantasy <em>Total War</em>. Rather it plays out like a miniatures game, one where each warrior must be painstakingly positioned and maneuvered to get the most out of them in battle. You’re usually with a special forces team or a beleaguered rearguard or a clever diversionary raiding party, in situations where you still feel like you’re part of a military fantasy epic, but the scale is a little more personal, and little more ground-level.</p><p>Which means you have ample opportunities to witness the chaos caused by the game’s physics model. Stray arrows knock out friendly troops, grenades take miraculous or cursed bounces or turn out to be duds. Flying bits of debris (usually bone and meat, being honest) will smack into other units and cause damage, or perhaps knock a spear off-course. It’s a game that feels gleefully at odds with a lot of notions of game balance: the same encounter in <em>Myth </em>might go horrifically wrong despite your best efforts or you might make a horrible mistake that somehow breaks in your favor and hands you a wholly unearned victory. But because this is all depicted on screen and driven by some simple physics and overpowered explosives, <em>Myth </em>usually feels funny and surprising rather than a game where you can get screwed by a bad dice roll.</p><p>This game also served as my introduction to Bungie, and I was kind of surprised when the next I heard of them was when they were in the early stages of promoting <em>Halo </em>before it was picked up by Microsoft. I didn’t know about their history as a shoot developer for Macs, and so I was kind of disappointed when the studio that made this fantasy tactics masterpiece became Halo Incorporated. At the time I thought <em>Halo </em>was the outlier, now I understand that if anything, the two <em>Myth </em>games are a wildly successful experiment from a shooter studio.</p><p>Playing it this week got me wondering, are there studios you’ve been a fan of that have a game or a series that fascinates you <em>because </em>it doesn’t seem to fit what they are known for?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Back when they made real box art, folks.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/53we99/backflips_n_bioforge/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“Did that say mecha raptor?”</u></a></p><p>Yeah, this one is easy. It’s Origin Systems making <em>BioForge</em>. I first fell for Origin Systems because of the <em>Wing Commander</em> series. More specifically, <em>Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger</em>. The more CDs a game shipped with, the better, imo. Remember <a href="https://www.indieretronews.com/2020/03/wing-commander-iii-heart-of-tiger-1994.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>that killer box art</u></a>? Absolutely irresistible. But this was an era where it wasn’t easy to look up the history of a studio, unless you came across it in, say, a <em>PC Gamer</em>.</p><p>In my mind, Origin made <em>Wing Commander</em> games, or at the very least, flight simulator games. It was 1994 and I was nine years old. I didn’t know what <em>Ultima</em> was. I didn’t know about <em>System Shock</em>, either.</p>

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive has announced that the game has already sold 500,000 copies, just after launch. In a social media post, the studio said the game reached this sales milestone "sooner than we'd ever imagined."</p><p>Expedition 33 is also on Game Pass, and presumably the 500,000 figure does not include people playing via the subscription service. Expedition 33 is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 2 best-selling game on Steam right now</a>, only behind Oblivion Remastered, and it's reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 70,000 concurrent players.</a> The game is also on PS5.</p><p>Some industry observers theorized that Expedition 33 might have had its lunch eaten by Oblivion Remastered, as it surprise-launched just two days before Expedition 33. Both are Game Pass titles, but clearly, there is enough room for multiple success stories this week. Both Bethesda and Sandfall <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-dev-congratulates-expedition-33-studio-on-game-pass-launch/1100-6531082/" data-ref-id="1100-6531082">shared congratulatory messages with each other</a> regarding their respective game launches this week.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a core team of around 30 people at Sandfall.

            <p>
Facebook owner Meta has reportedly cut over 100 jobs at Reality Labs, the division responsible for its virtual reality and augmented reality software and hardware, including Quest.
</p>
<p>
The news was initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/655835/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-supernatural">reported by The Verge</a>, whose sources said the cuts had impacted teams within Meta's Oculus Studios - which is focused on developing games for the company's Quest headsets - as well as "some" employees from Reality Labs' hardware arm. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true">later reported "more than 100" workers were impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed cuts had been made within Oculus Studios, saying "some" teams were "undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size." Clayton added the changes were intended to "help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today." The Verge says Meta declined to comment on layoffs outside of Oculus Studios.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff include the team behind Meta Quest fitness application Supernatural, which Meta acquired for $400m USD - alongside its developer Within - in 2023, following an anti-trust battle with the FTC. The Supernatural team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">confirmed it had been affected by Meta's latest layoffs</a> in a statement shared on Facebook, writing it was "deeply saddened" by the loss of "some of our incredibly talented team members".
</p>
<p>
Despite the layoffs, Meta says it remains "committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged."
</p>
<p>
Meta has dramatically reduced staff numbers of the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-announces-further-10000-job-losses">cutting more than 20,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023</a>. Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn - which Meta acquired in 2020 - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-heavily-impacted-by-latest-meta-layoffs">heavily impacted</a> by those cuts and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">closed down at the end of last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Reality Labs layoffs follow Meta's admission last April that the AR/VR <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-loses-a-billion-per-month-on-its-arvr-division-but-believes-it-will-be-worth-it">division had lost over $1bn every month</a> for most of the last two years, with the company saying it expected losses to increase as it deepened its investment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/reburn-has-delayed-la-quimera-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight-after-sending-out-review-codes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>La Quimera is a new first-person, linear, story-focused shooter from <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-developer-qa-powered-by-unreal-engine-4-main-story-to-last-5-hours/">Reburn</a>, the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, which previously worked on the Metro series with the rest of 4A Games based in Malta.</p>
<p>It was initially set to release today, April 25, 2025. The release date was set at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/">beginning of April</a>, and review codes were sent out to Wccftech and other members of the press ahead of today's launch. Shortly after reviews went live, Reburn announced within its Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/la-quimera-has-been-quietly-delayed-no-new-release-date/">DSOGaming</a>) that La Quimera was delayed, with no new release date set.</p>
<p>In a statement, chief executive officer Dmytro Lymar apologized for the last-minute delay and attributed the issues Reburn had to unexpected problems it faced with this being its first project as an independent studio and "<em>the circumstances we're faced with here in the Ukraine</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We'd like to apologise for the unexpected delay in getting La Quimera out to you, our fans and supporters. Our team here at Reburn has been working hard on the game, and it being our first title as an independent game developer has led to some unforeseen challenges. We are trying our best to address the matters as quickly as possible, while also navigating the circumstances we're faced with here in the Ukraine. We thank you for your patience, your continued support, and your understanding.</em>"</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/">review of La Quimera</a>, we noted plenty of bugs, which, on their own, made it abundantly clear that it needed more time in development. But the bugs weren't the only issues the game had. Core issues with the story and characters, with gameplay that only features a few cool moments, are all problems that take more than a few rounds of bug fixes to fix.</p>
<p>"<em>La Quimera is an incomplete game, a mixture of stitched together parts that don't come together to make a full image,</em>" our reviewer wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>The amount of bugs are clear indicators that this game needed more time in development, but so is the underwhelming story and gameplay that aren't given enough time to go anywhere. If La Quimera was communicated as an Early Access release, then I'd be more hopeful for what's to come, but if this is meant to be the full game, it's not one that's worth your time.</em>"</p>

Bubble Season starts April 29th and will include a new area, new activities, and, of course, new (and returning) outfits. But the biggest addition is one that fans have been asking for since launch: co-op. Check out the trailer above.</p><p>In the new season you’ll be able to have dress-up adventures with a friend in two player co-op mode. You can travel the world of<em> Infinity Nikki </em>together, solving special co-op mode puzzle games and participating in escort missions. Players will also prove they’re the most stylish one in the group chat with a fashion runway and new interactions that players can use in all the photos they’re going to take. </p><p>Like every new <em>Infinity Nikki</em> season, there will be special outfits to collect – though none of them inspire in me the kind of fanaticism that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">the cowgirl outfit</a> from two seasons ago did. (Which I did get without spending any money. Hooray!) For the first time though, <em>IN</em> is also bringing back outfits from previous seasons for players who missed out on them and for newbies to build up their wardrobe quickly. </p><div><p>Speaking of wardrobe,<em> Infinity Nikk</em>i is catching up to the MMO girlies by implementing a new dye system. In Bubble Season, players will be able to use dyes to change the color of their outfits the same way one can in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. No word on exactly how dyes will work or if they will be yet more things to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">spend your precious currency on</a>. But I am interested in the potential of getting new colors for my clothes without the hassle of the current system, which involves the expensive and time consuming process of collecting duplicate outfits.</p><p>Bubble Season starts April 29th and if you’re one of the folks waiting for the game to come to PC, the Steam version of<em> Infinity Nikki </em>launches that day too.</p></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll first encounter locked chests in the underground caverns beneath the prison, and then in nearly every dungeon thereafter. It’s a core component of the game. It’s also one of the most cumbersome to some players. But mastering the mini-game and leveling up essential skills will quickly turn your fortunes around. Eventually you’ll be putting the Gray Fox himself to shame.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196470,196848" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h160488"><a id=""></a>Skills that affect lockpicking</h2><figure id="" data-id="653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-recommend-id="image://653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-recommend-id="image://653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you think you’ll spend a lot of time lockpicking as a stealthy character, like one of the many members of the Thieves’ Guild, then <strong>you’ll want to increase your Security</strong>.</p><p>Like all other skills in the game, there are five levels to Security:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Novice (0)</strong>: Up to four tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Apprentice (25)</strong>: Up to three tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Journeyman (50)</strong>: Up to two tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Expert (75)</strong>: Only one tumbler will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Master (100)</strong>: No tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li></ul><p>You can level the skill by attempting lockpicks and speaking with the occasional thief or beggar to train your abilities higher in exchange for gold.</p><h2 id="h160489"><a id=""></a>How to lockpick successfully</h2><figure id="" data-id="21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-recommend-id="image://21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-recommend-id="image://21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before you attempt to break into a treasure chest filled with junk that you’ll likely toss aside to satisfy your weight limit, you must have lockpicks in your inventory.

It’s a total visual overhaul that remains so faithful to the original 2006 experience that Virtuos even thought to include some of its more memorable bugs and even a few handy glitches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Oblivion Remastered, players have found they’re still able to use a version of the original's Dupe Item Glitch, just the same as they did nearly 20 years ago. It allows the user to duplicate nearly any item in the game, and it only involves navigating through a few menus and a barrel or storage crate. That means unlimited arrows, ingredients, and even infinite money if you’re willing to be patient and haul everything to a merchant after you’re done.
