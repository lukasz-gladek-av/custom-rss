<figure><a title="BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162034/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entropy">Entropy</a>, a scientific concept defined by randomness and disorder, is a fitting name for a roguelike.</p>
<p>Since <strong>BlazBlue</strong> began as a fighting game series it’s seen a multitude of spin-offs, now finding itself in the realm of 2D platform action and roguelike principles. Its whopping assembly of eighteen-playable-characters helm from various BlazBlue entries, including <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/blazblue_calamity_trigger">Calamity Trigger</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/blazblue_continuum_shift">Continuum Shift</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/blazblue_chrono_phantasma">Chrono Phantasma</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_centralfiction_special_edition">Central Fiction</a>. And, impressively, each has a completely independent and idiosyncratic combat style, even if the actual inputs you utilise are fairly samey across the board.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273430/BlazBlue_Entropy_Effect/">BlazBlue Entropy Effect</a> was released back in 2024 on Steam. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blazblue_entropy_effect_x">Entropy Effect X</a> isn’t exactly the same game, but rather a definitive reworking. It cuts a lot of fat from the original, replacing the robot hub world with a lab of anime colleagues. It also streamlines events into an all-new, series-canon storyline that promises to be more coherent. Its success on this front is up for debate, however. Entropy Effect X also boasts new bosses, new Mind Crystal challenges, and new variable difficulty modes - but sadly loses crossplay functionality in the process. It also drops the original’s English dub for subtitled Japanese language only.</p>
<figure><a title="BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162039/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Entropy Effect’s X’s premise feels somehow reminiscent of <strong>Tron</strong>. Beginning as an amnesiac, a team of scientists send you into a mainframe subspace that blends reality with unreality; a kind of dystopian, futuristic nightmare world in decay. Your goal is to retrieve ‘Shards of Possibility’ in each run, and regardless of whether you fail or succeed you’re beamed back to HQ for a bit of story evolution, character unlocking, and an opportunity for some general retooling.</p>
<p>The plot, honestly, is total technobabble nonsense, and the kind of thing that oft rears its head in Japanese games. In its attempt to be profoundly deep it ends up being verbose, confusing, tedious, and skippable. There are, however, fully animated flashbacks that pop up whenever a Shard of Possibility is obtained, filling in the backstory of humanity’s collapse. They’re short, beautifully done, and worth sticking around for.</p>
<p>The eighteen-strong battle roster are all legacy BlazBlue cast members, unlocked in an order of your choosing. Each can be broadly increased in power and even have their attributes fused. The levelling process is handled by running through stages, obtaining MP, HP and DP level-ups, secondary skills, expanding movesets, and increasing critical stats. You can focus on building up one or several avatars, but getting all eighteen to full capacity will take months of commitment.</p>

<p>Each character is surprisingly diverse, borrowing unique elements from their fighting game profiles. Bullet is grapple strong, able to grab enemies and send them piling into others behind, while Noel is ranged, wielding dual handguns that can fire from distance. Hibiki has shadow skills that have secondary attack properties, and Takaoka can create clones, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Once deployed into the subspace in search of a Shard, Entropy Effect X is graphically slick through and through, and, while character and enemy sprites are on the small side (which doesn’t work so well in handheld) it still shines in terms of animation and panache. Night City, your first port of call, is very much a 2D Cyberpunk bedfellow, only with more deterioration. Mechanically, it’s snappy, and if you played last year’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> you’ll feel very much at home with its dashes, aerial attacks, and smorgasbord of evolving secondary attack properties.</p>
<figure><a title="BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162031/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While it’s strictly 2D side-on, its scaling system feels similar to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>, and with additional skill elements like Electricity, Fire and Ice - and the ability to focus on one suit for power increases - it has a lot in common with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. One oversight, though, is no combo counter. In a game that rewards perfect screen clears, especially on higher difficulties, a combo counter would be a good visual aid. This is especially true since the sprites are on the small side, and focusing on your blows amidst a flurry of enemies can be tricky. You’ll often find you lose energy without knowing what hit you as a result.</p>
<p>Entropy Effect X’s action happens on a screen-by-screen basis. You enter an area, randomly generated in its platforms and pitfalls, and clear all enemies before moving on. Exiting each screen offers a choice of several randomised options: grab new secondary skills or exchange existing ones; enter a shop to spend points on MP, HP or skill boosts; or even try your luck on a Gacha roulette that can net you lucky enhancements. At critical points during your run you can unlock permanent combat expansions for things like air-juggle techniques or combo extenders.</p>

<p>Initially, though, things feel a little dull and hollow, with a visual style that’s cold and impersonal. Continue playing, learning, and expanding however, and things start to simmer, putting pressure on you to pay attention to your upgrading process before you dive again. Its mammoth bosses are impressive, too, with patterns that demand reflex if you’re going to earn your next Shard.</p>
<p>Like all roguelikes, the longer you play the more Entropy Effect X starts to flourish. You can get neck deep in the game’s countless upgrades, and using the ‘Entropy’ system to increase a run’s difficulty makes it more formidable, but rewards with more powerful buffs. While higher difficulties are altogether more involving, they also require unlocking by finishing Normal Mode first.</p>
<p>Initially, grinding is the only way to go. Health increasing elixirs are in short supply and, owing to the random nature of things, you never know when you’ll be granted a “rest space” or other gratuities that can regenerate health. To this end, you’ll find yourself replaying early stages several times. This is fine on paper, but it does lack the initial reward momentum of something like Absolum, and if you’re committed to building a strong Avatar you’ll need to overcome the repetition.</p>

<p>The game’s conundrum though, is how one responds to its dizzying complexity. While on the face of it, Entropy Effect X is a blistering action combat game, its structuring is daunting. Generally, it feels overwrought from the get-go.</p>
<p>Like its sprawling, confusing narrative, the game itself is incredibly dense on the front end. The options and choices provided when exiting a screen are labeled in ways that make little sense, and you’ll need to repeat them countless times to remember what they all lead to. The language used in its tutorials is science textbook wordy, often using a home-grown vernacular that you haven’t a hope of understanding until you’ve given it hours of attention.</p>
<p>While the system has arguably too many configurable options, its convolution may still appeal to a certain strain of player. The problem is more in how things are explained — or not, as the case may be. You can comb through help screens to try to figure out how everything works, or plough through blindly with a nagging feeling that you’re overlooking key features.</p>
<figure><a title="BlazBlue Entropy Effect X Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162032/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the way the action is broken up is somewhat intrusive. Having tooling options when exiting a screen is fine, but when you're clearing them in thirty-seconds it becomes a little tiresome to keep entering between-screen spaces for upgrades or gacha rolls. Many of the exit options, like health increases or skill switches, could easily happen on the spot rather than having you move to interim areas.</p>
<p>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X is remarkable in its scope, dizzying in its depths, and impressive in its ambition. Its cast of characters is enormous, its combat taut, and its boss encounters impressive. Like any roguelike, it’s all about repetitive grind, but this isn’t a game that’s initially player-friendly. There are so many options, many of which are ambiguous, that it takes time to get a handle on all the possibilities and to tease out a strategy. To this end, it may turn some off before it has the chance to turn them on.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blazblue_entropy_effect_x">Blazblue Entropy Effect X</a>'s convolution will be a turn off for some, and for others a dream. There are some questionable design decisions in its lack of a visual combo counter, diminutive sprites, and stop-start upgrade screens, and the average action gamer will feel swamped by its narrative and overload of possible configurations. At the same time, it’s an undeniably impressive in scope: a mathematical formula of character building that's as flexible as it is complex.</p>
<p>Boomers should probably step away, but for those who live to mine roguelikes to the nth degree, it’s something of a treat.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Mario Tennis Fever Is The Definition Of A Meh Video Game]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As I played through <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>‘s barebones campaign and its other forgettable modes, like some scoring challenges, one word emerged from my brain to describe this latest installment in the series: perfunctory. That’s not great. Making it worse, though, is that Nintendo is selling this uninspired tennis game for $70. Ouch.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-tennis-fever-trailer-nintendo-switch-2-2000658134">Out now on Switch 2,<em> Mario Tennis Fever</em></a> is the latest example of Mario and his pals (and enemies) getting together to play a sport. Sometimes they play golf, sometimes soccer, every so often some baseball, they’ve even played basketball together on occasion. This time around, the sport of choice is tennis, and once again this <em>Mario Tennis</em> adventure is developed by Camelot, a studio that has been making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_Software_Planning"><em>Mario</em> sports spin-offs since 1999</a>. And if all you want is a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-tennis-on-switch-is-mostly-fun-but-frustrating-1826985674"><em>Mario Tennis </em>game</a> with a few modes, a decent roster of characters, and multiplayer support, then <em>Fever</em> checks all those boxes. The problem is that it does so with about as much enthusiasm as someone filling out paperwork at the DMV.</p>

 <h2>Tennis, anyone?</h2> <p>The big star of <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is the game’s adventure mode, which functions as a single-player campaign as well as a tutorial for how to play. It only took me about three hours to get through this adventure, and yet that was still too long. <em>Fever</em>‘s adventure mode is all about Mario, Luigi, and a few other key characters getting turned into babies after being attacked by a monster while getting a magic apple to heal Daisy from a horrible illness. To become adults again, they decide the best course of action is to fight the monster, and so they go to a tennis academy as babies to learn how to play a sport they’ve played so many times that there’s an entire franchise dedicated to it. Maybe this sounds goofy and silly. Trust me, it is not.</p> <p>Cutscenes in <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> are static, dull, and feature little movement or excitement. I’ve watched Powerpoint presentations that are more energetic and engaging than the cutscenes and narrative moments in <em>Fever</em>.</p>

  <p>Between these bits are tennis matches and tennis-themed minigames. None of these are awful, but they all tend to be very short, and I rarely felt like I was digging into some new feature or mechanic. For example, a big new element in <em>Fever</em> is a series of powerful tennis rackets that let you spawn fire, ice, mud, electricity, and other zany effects to disrupt your opponent. They can be powerful in adventure mode, but the game barely spends time on any one racket, so I never felt like I mastered anything before I was zipped off to a new location for more boring cutscenes and dialogue.</p>

 <p>As Baby Mario works his way through the adventure mode, he levels up, but you don’t have any control over what stats are improved, nor does the game offer side content for which levelling up is a big help. So the level-up system might as well not exist at all. Eventually, you beat the final boss, and the game ends with one more boring cutscene of characters not moving and chatting. Roll credits.</p> <h2>Seriously, does anybody want to play tennis?</h2> <p>Outside of the short and bad campaign are a series of other game modes that vary in quality from “okay” to “meh.” There are some score challenge mini-games that you can play against the computer or a friend. There’s a freeplay option that lets you and up to three other players locally play some tennis while changing the rules and other variables. There’s also a mode that lets you play using motion controls, but it only includes a handful of the special rackets, which seems bonkers and makes this option a waste. Just play <em>Wii Sports</em> tennis instead.</p>

 <p>My favorite mode is tournament, which pits you against different NPCs in a series of nearly uninterrupted tennis matches that lead to one final match to win that particular bracket. It’s not a revolutionary offering, but it at least focuses on the best part of <em>Mario Tennis Fever:</em> the actual act of playing tennis.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Come on, there aren't many other arcade-y tennis games to choose from."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Camelot Software Planning</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Colorful and wacky arcade tennis game </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Looks nice, feels fine to play, Fever rackets are fun</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Adventure mode is boring and bad, other modes are mostly forgettable, tennis gameplay feels floaty, $70</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Nintendo Switch 2</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished adventure mode in three hours, play around six hours of other modes solo and against other players</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>February 12, 2026</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>To be clear, I don’t think the tennis gameplay in <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is fantastic, as it lacks the depth I want from even the most arcade-y sports games and never felt precise enough for me. But it is easily the best part of the game. Hitting a ball really hard and aiming it at just the right spot to score feels sweet. Long rallies can get intense and, in my time with the game, almost always led to some cheering (or groaning) from folks watching or playing. So the fact that tournament mode focuses entirely on the tennis part of <em>Fever</em> made it easily my favorite way to play this latest <em>Mario</em> sports spin-off.</p> <p>Oh, and yes, there is online multiplayer, and it works, and… that’s about all there is to say, as it doesn’t feature any truly remarkable options. It’s<em> Mario Tennis Fever,</em> but online. Not exciting, but nice to have.</p>

 <p>Look, I get it. Sometimes you just do enough and move on. I’ve done that before in life. I can’t even count the number of times I turned in assignments in school that were just enough to pass and nothing more. Or how often I’d do just enough cleaning as a kid to convince my mom or dad that I’d picked up my room. The thing is, in those cases, I never charged anyone $70 for the privilege of receiving my minimum-effort offerings.<em> Mario Tennis Fever</em>, on the other hand, does just enough to be considered a new <em>Mario Tennis</em> game and calls it a day while charging a premium to play. Wait for a sale or go pick up a used copy of <em>Mario Tennis Aces</em> instead.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/18/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-brings-back-the-highs-lows-and-weirdness-of-90s-vr/</link>
            <guid>1439098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a lot of people wishing that the mid-2020s were more like the mid-1990s, but I don’t expect many were doing so for a chance to experience the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtual-boy">Virtual Boy’s</a> brief heyday. Yet here we are, with Nintendo releasing both a plastic recreation and a jazzed up cardboard edition of the Virtual Boy to go alongside the console’s addition to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>. It’s playable with Switch, Switch OLED and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, so we’ve done just that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch Virtual Boy unboxing and first impressions –&nbsp;can 90s VR make a comeback?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qGmf65wkZaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The plastic shell of the Virtual Boy has been recreated in a charmingly accurate fashion from a distance, but you see plenty of fakery when you pay closer attention. All of the physical controls, sockets and sliders of the original Virtual Boy –&nbsp;the IPD slider, the volume wheel, controller port and all the rest –&nbsp;are now just surface details, and like a treasure chest that reveals itself to be a Mimic in a D&amp;D campaign, the red shell at the top of the body now opens up to reveal a cavernous maw, eager to consume your console.</p>


<p>Far more accurate are the backward tilted legs, sturdily holding the headset in place, and stubbornly allowing just a single adjustment. There’s no up or down here, just a tilt back and forward, and it means that you have to really lean in to get your Virtual Boy on. If potential eye strain weren’t enough reason for Nintendo to suggest regular breaks, then bad posture and possible back pain were another. While remaining authentic to the original is admirable in some ways, it means this remains an annoyance for anyone that isn’t my cat. I found that the box the Virtual Boy came in brought the headset up to a sensible viewing height for me.</p>
<div id="attachment_469015"><p id="caption-attachment-469015">The Virtual Boy is for ages 7+, but my cat is 3, so it was not turned on at this time.</p>
</div>
<p>Another slight disappointing element is the inelegance of Nintendo’s solution to the difference in shape and size of the Switch and Switch 2. Another detail on the underside of the Virtual Boy is that the protuberance that the stand grabs onto is also a basket to catch and support the console, the inside having a funnel and hinged flap to ensure it’s in roughly the right place, with a little bit of wiggle room. The basket is screwed onto the body of the Virtual Boy, and it’s sized for the Switch 2 by default, with a separate plate for the original Switch and Switch OLED included in the box.</p>
<p>I’d argue that’s overkill, and a needless faff for Switch 1 owners, when really a plastic insert would have done the trick. Heck, in a pinch when wanting to swap back and forth and compare screens, I just shoved my little finger in to give a modicum of support, and a plastic wedge could have made this more easily universal, in my opinion.</p>
<div id="attachment_469011"><p id="caption-attachment-469011">The Virtual Boy Switch 1 support is a bit of a basket case.</p></div>
<p>Another problem with the baskets? There’s no space for a USB-C charging cable or any kind of power pass through. Switch 2 could, I suppose, play with the top lid cocked open for the top charging port, letting outside light leak in more easily. In general, now you’re playing with (battery) power.</p>
<p>What really matters is what’s happening inside the headset, and you’ll have to peer into this mysterious box to see it. Back in 1995, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW7M8H99x7Y">Nintendo had to pull some remarkable mirror-waggling tricks</a> to get the single-colour LED strips to trick your eyes into seeing images, but in 2026, it’s the standard VR headset method of viewing a screen through distorting lenses. In both case, however, you look through a thick red filter, cutting out all of the other colours that the screen can display.</p>
<p>So, between Switch, Switch OLED and Switch 2, which console gives the best Virtual Boy experience? With this plastic Virtual Boy? I’d have to say the Switch 2. The simple fact is that it’s a higher resolution screen, allowing it to display the 384×224 of a Virtual Boy screen in a smaller space, so you can take in the full image more easily as it appears further away. Each console displays at 1:1 by default, and I feel that with the Switch and Switch OLED in particular, this makes it too large within the headset so that I’m occasionally moving my viewing angle to see if I’m missing something in the corners –&nbsp;and when this is a 3D effect, messing around like this and shifting focus can give you a real headache.</p>
<div id="attachment_469012"><p id="caption-attachment-469012">The Switch OLED renders the Virtual Boy much larger than on Switch 2.</p></div>
<p>It’s a big difference. The Switch 2 puts Wario Land into a 35mm wide postage stamp per eye, before passing through the lenses, while the Switch comes in at 41.5mm and the Switch OLED at 46.5mm. It’s a huge difference, and it makes the pixel grid much, much more visible. You can adjust the zoom within the emulation, to at least shrink the image size, if not the pixels on the Switch OLED –&nbsp;Switch 2, meanwhile, has a wider zoom range and can go up to 1.3x in size to effectively match the Switch OLED at 45mm. I’ve never used an original Virtual Boy, so cannot say what is most authentic, but I’d personally rather see more of the game view than less.</p>
<p>OLED does have its advantages, though, with the cardboard edition in mind. With an OLED panel, any pixel on the screen that’s not in use is off. It’s pitch black. Meanwhile, the backlights of the Switch 2 and Switch bleed through the black and make it a dark blue, to my eyes. The red lenses cut out all but the red light, helping to even the playing field with the plastic Virtual Boy, but the cardboard one doesn’t have the red filter, which can make the Switch OLED king in this scenario.</p>

<p>And so we come to the games. The game selection menu passes through the filter in an ominous red hue, but this is actually a bit of a lie, as it’s rendered in full colour by the console. The games themselves are all-red all of the time, though. Seven games are featured on day one, from 3D Tetris to Golf, Red Alarm, Teleroboxer, and the most noteworthy by far, Virtual Boy Wario Land.</p>
<p>Coming a year after his debut as a protagonist on the Game Boy, Virtual Boy Wario Land pioneered multi-plane platforming, with Wario able to use jump pads to bounce to parts of the world further away from the camera, and really pushed the number of parallax layers featured to give the environments its 3D depth. There’s smaller details too, like blocks having multiple layers to them, even little grassy fronds on the ground having a couple layers, giving added depth here, and the sprite scaling as things move in and out of the screen is really nicely done. Practically the first thing you encounter are spiked balls swinging towards your view, and it shows the smoothness of this.</p>

<p>Teleroboxer does a similarly good job with the boxing robots you fight having lots of layered sprites to create a canny 3D effect, and The Mansion of Innsmouth has the classic first person 3D dungeon crawling aesthetic as you move through corridors, while blasting monsters with an on-screen cursor. But for true 3D, you’ve really got to look to Red Alarm, a Star Fox style rail shooter with the world rendered in red wireframe –&nbsp;with just a single colour, this was probably the best path to take, but does mean you can see enemies through obstacles.</p>
<p>And then there’s 3D Tetris, which takes the notion of the block-dropping puzzle and makes it feel like Star Trek’s 3D chess. The classic tetromino shapes are put to one side, and you’re instead given other blocky assortments, layering them down on multiple flat layers. It can be tricky to make out how things are being placed with the shifting 3D view of the Tetris lasagna you’re making, and it’s odd to have split blocks to drop as well. Thankfully the right of your view has a simple 2D representation of the layers and where each block will land. It’s a bit of a cheat, but makes this more playable.</p>

<p>The main problem with the Virtual Boy’s game line up is that it never had the chance to mature. 1995 means that we were still getting experiences and ideas from the SNES or Game Boy, in part thanks to the single colour displays, and it was a time when sports games like Golf and Mario’s Tennis were… well, they were just fairly standard golf and tennis games. Neat to see, but not exactly ground-breaking.</p>
<p>All in all, the Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch feels authentic (even if closer inspection does make it appear more toylike), and does a solid job of rendering the console’s small selection of games. It is a shame that, when this costs £67, Nintendo didn’t push on to remake the Virtual Boy controller, improve the ergonomics of using the headset, or even build in the ability to charge and play at the same time. That high price means that Virtual Boy will remain a retro curio for Switch owners and gaming history enthusiasts.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> now has a bunch more possibilities when it comes to one of the most important fantasy RPG build archetypes, thanks to the deployment of its anniversary update. Three new character races are on offer alongside the established humans and elves, and you can arm them with a quarterstaff which caters to mages who think puny wands and books aren't quite showy enough.</p>
<p>As you might recall, some of the stuff included in this anniversary update was orignally supposed to arrive in Avowed late last year, but ended up being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-new-game-plus-fresh-kind-of-weapon-and-photo-mode-are-now-coming-in-a-beefy-anniversary-update">delayed by Obsidian</a>.</p>

<p>The three new races you can pick from once you've installed this latest Avowed update, the full notes for which are on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/511857117305504144?l=english">Steam</a>, are dwarves, orlans, and aumaua. I'm going to assume you know what a dwarf is, but for reference orlans are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe's short, hairy and pointy-eared fellows. Aumaua are the big battlers whose skin sometimes resembles fish scales - Avowed's most memorable companion Kai is one. </p><p>If you opt to play as a dwarf, you'll benefit from an additional point to your might and constitution stats, while orlans get boosts to perception and resolve. Aumaua, meanwhile, get plus two to might, because fish Hulk smash. Personally, I think next time I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-facial-mushrooms-hide-a-fantasy-romp-thats-well-worth-your-time-disagree-and-my-arquebus-awaits">hop into Avowed</a> I'll opt for one of the first two races, because the update's new weapon is perfect for an angry little ball of deadliness.</p>
<p>It's a quarterstaff, which Obsidian describe as a "bludgeoning weapon that comes complete with wand style stun finishers", making it ideal for roleplaying as a mage with an ego the size of Eora. Small person, possibly with furry ears. Big magic stick to fuel their big magic ego. The hijinks write themselves.</p>
<p>Avowed's anniversry update also brings the likes of a new game plus mode and the ability to snap some photos as your angry little ball of deadliness beats their way through the Living Lands with their big stick of spells.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be treated well in 2026, the 30th anniversary of the franchise, and Pokopia will make waves when it arrives, with a variety of multiplayer offerings.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is set for release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, putting players in control of a humanoid Ditto in a relaxing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game where humans have mysteriously disappeared, leaving a world of Pokémon behind.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering about the multiplayer options for Pokopia, including whether split-screen is supported, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-pokemon-pokopia-have-multiplayer">Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rebuild. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokopia supports co-op multiplayer in a variety of ways, including the ability to game share with players who don’t own the game themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s sharing feature, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" id="157583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enables those on the original Switch console to play</a>, brings players who don’t own the game themselves into the fold. However, the host must be online, and a fresh connection is required every time you want to play Pokopia in this way.</p>



<p>Multiplayer options also allow for up to four players to play simultaneously across a selected island, akin to Animal Crossing, which can be conducted via local wireless or online multiplayer. A Nintendo Switch Online membership is required for the latter.</p>



<p>Additionally, there is also a Cloud Island, a co-op mode where players create a blank town from scratch together, separate from the game’s main story. The main difference is that the host does not need to be online for the island to be accessible, and there’s no limit to the number of players who can join the island, although only four can be online at a time.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-pokemon-pokopia-have-split-screen-multiplayer">Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Split-Screen Multiplayer?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Pokopia does not support multiplayer across a single system, and additional Nintendo Switch consoles are required to play in the same household.</strong></p>



<p>All local co-op is network-based, requiring connection to the same wireless network, or held via online connection, which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>



<p>While this may be frustrating, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise, as Pokémon Legends: Z-A and other Pokémon games largely don’t offer split-screen playing, with the exception being Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee.</p>

            <p>Today, in News I Didn't Expect To Ever Write, I bring to you <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Souji Souai LOVE</a>, a free game by chemical and cosmetics giant Kao Corporation that stars idols, only the idols are cleaning products. As in... their heads are bottles of detergent and other products. Japan once again proves its marketing game is centuries ahead of the rest of the world's.</p>
<p>The shocking news came to our attention via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/finally-an-idolmaster-clone-game-where-the-idols-are-all-detergents-and-cleaning-agents/">Automaton</a>. The site details the game is a 20-minute visual novel-style sim that has players embody a "rookie producer" tasked with making sure the group Shining4's debut performance isn't a failure. In traditional VN fashion, you must get to know each team member better and help them with menial tasks, such as... cleaning toilets (using their heads, I guess).</p>
<p>"It's exactly like one of my wacky animes," you might be thinking, and yeah, you're totally right. Souji Souai LOVE doesn't feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-EFRFk4fA0">little girls transforming into cars after drinking gas</a>, but it's odd enough from the get-go, and its catchy central song goes the extra mile to sell us on Kao's pitch:</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, a decent amount of money, time, and talent went into this marketing stunt, and Japanese social media users are shocked the company even got singer and voice actor Yoshiki Nakajima (The Idolmaster: SideM) and J-pop artist Kent Ito, among others, to voice these characters. "The four idols are Kyukyutto (dish soap), Bath Magiclin (bathtub cleaner), Toilet Magiclin (toilet bowl cleaner), and Quickle Wiper Three-dimensional Wet Sheets (for cleaning floors), all based on real-life products," Automaton's report revealed.</p><p>The game can be played through <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Kao's official homepage</a> and works on PC and mobile. It may not be for everyone, but considering how much time the average Internet user spends every day doomscrolling on social media, this seems like a better use of a fraction of one's daily phone time.</p>

            <p>After showing off a selection of PlayStation-exclusive charms for in-game weapons, the Marathon social media account has indicated that similar charms will be coming to other platforms like PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>This post, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023835955149623660">made in response to a community question on the matter</a>, states:"We'll have weapons charms for Steam and Xbox players as well, which we'll share more about in the future!"</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023819735737967016">The charms shown off</a> for PlayStation players include little weapon cosmetics referencing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. So for PC and console, one wonders what sort of other games will get nods in the form of such attachments.</p>
<p>Things really seem to be ramping up for Marathon. Not only did it take up a big spot during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">the recent Sony State of Play</a>, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Server Slam test</a> happening between the 26th February until the 2nd March. Finally, players will be able to make their own mind up on whether the game is a hit or a miss.</p><p>The game has certainly ran into its fair share of hurdles during development. Initial feedback on previous tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">weren't entirely positive</a>, with many criticising the PvE aspect of the game as well as missing features like proximity voice. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">a massive plagiarism scandal</a>, which required developers to comb through the game to remove elements of work belonging to artist Antireal.</p>
<p>The game's journey to launch is nearly at an end, with the game launching next month on the 5th March. Will you be checking it out? Let us know!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/highguard-website-remains-down-fans-worry-this-is-it/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As far as triple-A-ish games go, <strong>Highguard</strong> might go down in history as one of the games that spent the least time in the spotlight, and even when it did, it was all for the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>The game <strong>was a complete secret</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until The Game Awards 2025</a>. The CEO of game developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Dusty Welch, </strong>would later reveal that their original goal was to <strong>shadowdrop the game</strong> in late January, much as <strong>Respawn's Apex Legends</strong> did back in 2019 (on which several members of the team had worked). However, when <strong>Geoff Keighley</strong> suddenly came to Wildlight with the offer to close out The Game Awards ceremony with a Highguard trailer, Welch felt it would have been foolish to refuse.</p>



<p>As they say, <strong>hindsight is 20/20</strong>, but there's no doubt that <strong>that unveiling has backfired majorly</strong>. Viewers wanted to see a big new <span>single-player game as the show's closing announcement, not another hero shooter, and&nbsp;<strong>immediately criticized both Keighley and Highguard itself</strong>, setting the stage for&nbsp;</span>negative sentiment that hit the game like a hammer.</p>



<p>Rather than delaying the game and perhaps trying to address some of the early complaints, Wildlight <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still launched Highguard as planned</a></strong> in late January. Unsurprisingly, the Steam page <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly filled with negative reviews</a></strong>, just as Dusty Welch had admitted the trailer didn't showcase their game well.</p>



<p>Last week, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Wildlight <strong>had already been forced to lay off most of the team</strong>, following the game's terrible launch. A few days ago, one of the developers who was laid off <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized players</a> for failing to give Highguard a chance</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, <strong>the game appears to be on its deathbed</strong>. The 24-hour concurrent player peak on Steam was just 1,507 players, and the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> has been down for several hours. Those few players who actually enjoy the game are worried its closure might be announced at any moment. Meanwhile, Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Chinese giant <strong>Tencent</strong>, one of the biggest gaming publishers, was the secret investor behind the game. </p>



<p>What do you think of Highguard and its seemingly brief life? Did it deserve more or not? Let us know in the poll and comments.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">PC gaming</strong> has been in a rough spot in the past few years, with too many games launching with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">technical and optimization issues</strong> that are left unresolved. However, there are times when a game's optimization is judged based on a game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra settings</strong>, which creates a situation where developers—such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-nintendo-switch/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a></em></strong> <strong>PC</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS5,</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> version developer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PH3's Peter "Durante" Thoman</strong>—have to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protect players from themselves"</em> and balance optimization with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proofing</strong> their games.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19632-ys-x-proud-nordics-durante-interview-ph3-switch-2-dlss-ps5-pro-switch-1-trails-beyond-the-horizon-port-challenges-tea-2026-exclusive">RPGFan</a></em></strong>, the legendary developer, who some may remember for fixing the flawed PC port of the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dark Souls</em></strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19">DSFix</a></strong>, was asked for clarification about the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protecting players from themselves"</em> statement made when talking about the PC port of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Trails beyond the Horizon</em></strong> regarding some players cranking up the settings to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra</strong> and complain about optimization.</p>



<p><em>"I don’t think it’s 'a lot' of players, but this does happen. And it is very annoying – not (just) because it’s our work, but because it’s genuinely <strong>counter-productive</strong>,"</em> Durante said. <em>"We try very hard to implement a huge amount of settings in order to make our <strong>PC versions scale</strong> from low-power devices like the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> all the way to an RGB-riddled gaming rig with a <strong>500 Watt monster GPU</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Not many PC ports offer this level of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">scalability</strong> nowadays, <span>which creates a critical issue, according to the&nbsp;<em><strong>developer of the Ys X: Proud Nordics</strong></em>&nbsp;port</span>. </p>



<p><em>"That’s the crux: as a developer, we get to decide what e.g. <strong>'Ultra'</strong> means. And people judging the <strong>'optimization'</strong> of a game based on how it runs at <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong> creates <strong>perverse incentives</strong> for this,"</em> Durante said. <em>"Taking this to its logical conclusion, if we were to remove the <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong>, rename <strong>'Very High' to 'Ultra'</strong>, and make no other changes, then this metric would say that our game is now much more <strong>'optimized'</strong>."</em></p>



<p>With this widespread misperception, it's not easy for any developer to offer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">highly scalable settings</strong> that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof</strong> games. However, there's plenty of value in doing so. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"As a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC gaming enthusiast</strong> for over 20 years now, going back to older games with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new hardware</strong> and seeing them in a new light is something I greatly enjoy – and disincentivizing developers from adding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">high-end options</strong> goes directly against that,"</em> Durante concluded.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Durante’s stance</strong> is a call for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nuanced understanding</strong> of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC and console performance</strong>, which seems to have been lost in the past few generations. By refusing to cap a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC port's settings</strong> to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">console equivalent</strong>, or only slightly beyond it, developers would prioritize the platform's greatest asset: its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">longevity</strong>. </p>



<p>I’ve experienced this firsthand when <strong>revisiting older</strong> titles like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>. Seeing it <strong>scale to modern resolutions and framerates</strong> years later is what makes PC gaming unique. If CD Projekt Red had <strong>capped those settings back then to match the hardware of the time</strong>, I would have never experienced the game in the new light Durante mentioned.</p>



<p>Hopefully, more developers will offer more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof Ultra settings</strong>, although with the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remasters</strong> consistently getting announced, I don't personally believe this will happen anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">soaring SSD prices</a>, slower-but-cheaper mechanical hard drives may have offered an attractive reprieve for anyone wanting to embiggen their PC storage on a – and I know it’s increasingly difficult to use this word without breaking down into desperate laugh-crying – budget. Unfortunately, that probably ain’t happening either, as leading HDD manufacturers Western Digital and Seagate have both revealed that they’ve already sold “pretty much” all of their mechanical drive stock that was allocated for 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by German tech site <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/WD-and-Seagate-confirm-Hard-drives-for-2026-sold-out-11178917.html">Heise</a>, the admissions (or boasts, depending how you look at it) came during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864150-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">WD</a> and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863159-seagate-technology-holdings-plc-stx-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seagate’s</a> respective earnings calls in January. WD CEO Tiang Yew Tan said that in addition to maxing out production for 2026, "robust commercial agreements" for 2027 and 2028 are already in place with major buyers, while Seagate’s CEO William Mosley claimed the company’s HDD output capacity is "fully allocated" through the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Naturally, the bulk-buying of these hard drives – which is already causing shortages and heighted prices for home PC users – is being performed by the same entities that are driving the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">SSD and RAM shortages</a>. Namely, big tech companies wanting to build and kit out enormous data centres from which to run their AI products, like those genAI tools that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game devs hate</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hooded-horse-ban-ai-generated-art-in-their-games-all-this-thing-has-done-is-made-our-lives-more-difficult">publishers are banning</a>. Cool! This industry-wide rush has, for months, been causing a DRAM chip shortage that’s managed to widely knacker PC component availability, gouge prices, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">delay Valve’s new Steam Machine</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">kill off Crucial</a>. Seems we can add hard drives to the list of casualties, a development that also spells more bad news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> prices. If mech drives aren’t available as a cheaper alternative, that’s yet more demand being piled on SSDs, which would inevitably make supplies even scarcer and ticket prices even heavier.</p>
<p>For now, at least, a quick canter through the Internet shops suggests that hard drive supplies haven’t yet dried up entirely, and they’re still cheaper than equivalent-capacity NVMe SSDs. Still, they are snared in the same pricing trap: this <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Barracuda-internal-Drive-Modellnr/dp/B0BYT7BD4Y">1TB Seagate Barracuda</a> is £80 at the time of writing, but was £52 at the end of January, and £43 in December 2025. And with replacement stock having apparently been flogged to Microsoft and the like, don’t expect that to drift back down anytime soon.</p><p>I recently asked some specialist hardware manufacturers, as part of an upcoming feature, whether they’d advise PC upgrade seekers to take the money hit now or wait until things (hopefully) calm down in 2027. Responses were mostly mixed, but everyone agreed – as do I – that if you <em>can </em>keep going with your current components, SSD or HDD storage included, you probably should.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a> has published a preliminary roadmap for the first half of 2026, and it includes some juicy content updates. The game went wide in November with the long-awaited 1.0 release, and Battlestate Games has been keeping the pipeline plugged with patches and events ever since.</p>



<p>In Patch 1.0.5.0, which will land in Q2 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> players will come face to face with a new boss character, introduced via a ‘large-scale in-game event’, amongst other things.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-2026-roadmap-is-looking-good">Tarkov’s 2026 Roadmap is Looking Good</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled the Escape from Tarkov roadmap that takes us to the end of Q2 (around June-July). The heart of the roadmap sits with EFT Patch 1.0.5.0, which features a new <strong>boss character</strong>, who is currently unnamed and unidentified, and a large-scale in-game event, which will presumably <strong>announce </strong>said character.</p>



<p>Before we get to that, we’ve got EFT Patch 1.0.4.0:</p>



<ul>
<li>DLSS 4.5</li>



<li>Technical improvements to story task functionality and reward distribution</li>



<li>Reworked weapon animations and movement while aiming</li>



<li>Sound effects for dropped magazines</li>



<li>Balancing fixes, QoL changes, and cumulative fixes based on player feedback</li>



<li>Raid reconnect system rework</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to the new boss event in Tarkov in Q2, users can also expect:</p>



<ul>
<li>Technical improvements focused on reducing the match loading and exit times, as well as improving the interface performance outside of raids</li>



<li>Culling system update focused on improving in-raid performance (<strong>finally</strong>)</li>



<li>Vegetation rework across all locations</li>



<li>Balancing fixes, QoL changes, and cumulative fixes based on player feedback</li>



<li>New PMC customization options</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Battlestate promised that more is coming in the second half of 2026. Fans of the popular extraction shooter are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the game’s first DLC drop, which, from what we know, will focus on living life as a Scav character. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but given that it’s <strong><em>technically </em></strong>half of the base game (PMC vs. Scav character), it should be sizeable.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is almost here, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">we're confident it might be a hit</a>, especially after learning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-pokopia-has-minecraft-style-persistent-servers-director-confirms">Minecraft-like persistent servers</a> are part of the game. Now we're just hoping it delivers on all its promise when it launches on 5th March. Wanna get more hyped tho?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's massive interview</a> with key creatives on the game had already given us plenty of interesting tidbits, and the latest (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-boasts-largest-development-team-in-omega-force-history-with-dragon-quest-builder-2s-game-and-art-director-on-board/">Automaton</a>) confirms the project enlisted Omega Force (a Koei Tecmo studio) only after a group of developers saw and was instantly fascinated by Game Freak's original vision for Pokopia.</p>
<p>As reported before, it was game and map designer (now senior director) <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-creator-says-the-idea-came-from-his-rookie-days-placing-grass-on-the-map-at-game-freak/">Shigeru Ohmori's work on Ruby and Sapphire</a> placing grass patches and vegetation that first inspired the idea for a simulator which encouraged player creativity and was all about creating a world for the Pokémon to live in. The concept wouldn't evolve until "more than 20 years" later, when Ohmori delivered a game prototype and promotional video that prompted Game Freak to take the pitch more seriously.</p>
<p>Producer Kanako Murata confirmed to Famitsu that Koei Tecmo was brought in after some of its key <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> creatives saw Ohmori's materials, which "provided such a clear picture of the game's vision" that Omega Force felt they could contribute massively to it alongside Game Freak. The rest is history, and we're about to play the final result soon.</p><p>The new report also highlights the development team and Game Freak worked together "over the course of 3 to 4 months before commencing development in earnest," which apparently didn't take very long either; game director Takuto Edagawa and art director Marina Ayano (DQ Builders 2 veterans) stated "all involved parties" solved the core problems and more unique ideas before entering full development.</p>
<p>A time frame wasn't revealed, but it sounds like Pokémon Pokopia has ultimately been one of those projects where everything comes together nicely and the finish line was never too far away. Will it be the cozy life sim of many fans' dreams? I sure hope so.</p>

<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 19.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-developing-another-monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-expansion-similar-to-iceborne"><u>as we learned last week</u></a>, we're also getting the Arch-Tempered Arkveld, 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 — a spin-off series that releases next month — plus an anniversary event where all previous awards and quests will be "re-available."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned last week that Monster Hunter Wilds will welcome a "large-scale" expansion later this year. Addressing fans in a video celebrating the open-world adventure game's first anniversary, series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto teased that this expansion will be similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world"><u>Monster Hunter World</u></a>'s Iceborne add-on, but was otherwise coy about the details. He did, however, stress that this will be the "final update" for the monster hunting game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds has had something of a bumpy ride. Title Update 4 arrived at the end of last year and ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load." A development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, outlined plans to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that you won't be able to access DLC or play online multiplayer until this update has been installed.

"Some issues have been identified with AMD Radeon drivers versions 25.10.2 and higher on certain PCs using AMD Radeon graphics cards such as the AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT/7800 XT," the team warned.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Full patch notes for Monster Hunter Wilds Ver.1.041.00.00 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Release Date</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wednesday February 18, 2026 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday February 17, 2026 6:30 p.m. PT)</li><li>Note: Release date and time are subject to change without prior notice.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Required Space (Current Update Only)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>PlayStation5: Approx. 13.0 GB</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: Approx. 16.0 GB</li><li>Steam: Approx. 15.0 GB (With High Resolution Texture Pack: Approx. 18.0 GB total)</li><li>Note: Make sure to have enough additional storage to allow for slight differences in final size.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Major Additions and Changes</strong></h3><strong>Monsters</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.</li><li>– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</li></ul><strong>Player</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</li></ul><strong>Story Progression</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added.

            <p>Crimson Desert will be fully voiced by humans, Pearl Abyss's marketing director has assured in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Speaking with John Paul McDaniel (ItmeJP) and his peers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">the Dropped Frames podcast</a>, marketing director Will Power responded to a question on whether all the voices in upcoming open world action RPG Crimson Desert will be voiced by human beings.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to criticize other games, but all of our voices are done by humans," Power stated. "I'm refraining from saying that 100% of the NPCs have human voices [...] because if that's not the case for even one NPC, I don't want the internet to accuse me of lying. But yes, all the main NPCs and those in side quests have actors' voices. The game features voice acting in different languages."</p>
<p>These languages, as of writing, are English, Korean and Chinese according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/">the game's Steam page</a>, however <a href="https://www.sisaweek.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=228580">previous reporting has claimed that other languages are in the works</a>.</p>
<p>This same interview featured Will Power emphasising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crimson-desert-has-no-microtransactions-at-launch-says-pearl-abyss">Crimson Desert was a "premium experience"</a>, with no microtransactions whatsoever unlike its predecessor Black Desert Online. The game's been drumming up a lot of excitement as of late with its 19th March release date soon approaching.</p><p>It's a wild time to be alive when fully human-voice performances are something that stands out as a positive in an industry grappling with generative AI technology. However, given the positive reception to the lack of microtransactions and this, there's clear appetite for a polished game made with human hands.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> getting a native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version was one of those no-brainers we expected to see as soon as the console launched, yet it took more than a few months to arrive, and when it finally did, it was a mess. What happened there? It's a game from 2011, for Talos' sake.</p>
<p>If you hadn't been keeping track of the recent situation, the Switch 2 port of Skyrim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E">arrived in December out of nowhere</a> and promising sharper visuals and stronger performance than its Switch 1 counterpart. The first part was true; Skyrim's Anniversary Edition (the most recent version of the game that comes with plenty of Creation Club content) on Switch 2 was lots sharper and more detailed, landing next to the more recent refreshes of the game and even sporting sharper looks than on handheld PCs due to impressive <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-on-switch-2-ps5-level-visuals-marred-by-input-lag">DLSS implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game didn't <em>feel </em>good to play. Note how I'm not saying the performance was bad. Input lag is an entirely different thing, and that was the problem. Veteran players instantly noted the massive issue, and <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-suffers-from-kinect-level-input-lag-on-switch-2">Digital Foundry later confirmed everyone's suspicions</a> the game was suffering from terrible delay between pressing buttons and actions happening.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we also wanted a 60 FPS mode for a 2011 game that was already running amazingly well on the Steam Deck and other handheld PCs, but 30 FPS was fine (Skyrim is not a fast-paced game) in exchange for the sharpest portable version of the game we'd seen so far. But you know, put in the work to make it not feel like <em>shite</em> due to unresponsiveness.</p><p>Last month, a quick patch uncapped the framerate, which helped with the overall input lag but felt like a band-aid fix. Plus, resolution and graphical settings were barely altered, so the game never really hit 60 FPS and thus felt wobbly and unstable, especially when Docked, as Switch 2's VRR screen could mask some of its unevenness. <em>Not quite there.</em></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s Switch 2 port around the corner (24th February), pressure was mounting. How could we be excited for that version of the game when the far simpler Skyrim wasn't running properly? Well, things have changed now, as <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">the just-released 1.2 patch</a> takes a hammer to input lag, stability issues, and overall control awkwardness. More importantly, Performance and Visuals (Quality) modes are now a thing that can be toggled at any time.</p>

</figure>
<p>On paper, the choices are simple: 30 FPS with sharper graphics or 60 FPS with softer visuals due to a lower internal resolution. After spending some time with the game after the patch myself, I can say they work exactly as intended, and even the 30 FPS mode delivers more responsive controls than what we had before. There are bigger differences beyond the resolution cut to hit the sweet 60 FPS line though (see above).</p><p>The most obvious cutback is the one done to object density and LOD details. Like in older versions of the game (or the PC one when you lowered settings), grass draw distance sees the biggest change. When targeting Performance, it'll pop-in a few tens of meters ahead of you, which reminds me of the original versions of the game. Distant details, including NPCs, also feel instantly blurrier, and shadows are chunkier. Moreover, textures are less defined in order to free up resources.</p>
<p>In practice, however, I think most players will agree the game still looks fine and better than its original iterations, and the 60 FPS target is consistently maintained in my experience so far. Whether you play Skyrim in third or first-person, all the aiming and imsim-like interactivity greatly benefits from higher framerates, and going with Performance here feels like the only path forward to me. The 30-FPS Visuals mode is solid now if you can get used to it though, and since these options can be swapped on the fly, I'd recommend it to get the best possible screenshots even if you're going with Performance during normal play.</p>
<p>Overall, Skyrim on Switch 2 finally feels like what we should've gotten back in December, and while there's room for extra improvements and fine-tuning (maybe a Balanced 40 FPS mode for handheld?) in future patches, Bethesda's modern RPG classic is a perfect fit for the system. Bring on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>!</p>

			<p><strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape</strong> is a new large scale mod project that aims to <strong>restore content cut by CAPCOM</strong> from the original game while also <strong>adding several things</strong>, including the classic Ink Ribbon save system and new locations. Here's the official overview:</p>



<p><em>This mod is a complete reimagining and expansion of Resident Evil 3 Remake. I’m restoring cut content and adding entirely new locations, expanding the city, and redesigning core gameplay systems to create a darker, more survival-focused experience inspired by the original game. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Features: </strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>New playable locations (city areas, UpTown, Clock Tower, Park, Disused Plant, Cemetery, RPD, and more)</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded and reworked level layouts</em></li>



<li><em>New Nemesis encounters and boss fights</em></li>



<li><em>Redesigned item placement and progression</em></li>



<li><em>New puzzles and mechanics</em></li>



<li><em>Reworked crafting system with multiple new gunpowder types</em></li>



<li><em>Ink Ribbon save system from Resident Evil 2</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The YouTube channel includes several demonstration videos of Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape. We've embedded a few below.</p>

<p>As with all these projects, there is no release window in sight, so <strong>it may be a while before it becomes available</strong>. It isn't, however, the first mod of its kind: in 2020, the <strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Expanded Map Mod</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-expanded-map-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slightly expanded the map</a> and allowed more free exploration in the early game, though its scope was much narrower than Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape.</p>



<p>Out of all the Resident Evil remakes, Resident Evil 3 <strong>is definitely the least successful</strong>, having been criticized by critics and fans alike for its short length, a problem made all the more evident after the cuts of locations like the Clock Tower and the Park, which the mod mentioned in this article is attempting to restore. Even so, perhaps "least successful" deserves air quotes, as the game <strong>still managed to reach CAPCOM's Best-Selling Top 10 chart with 10.90 million units sold</strong> as of the most recent update of this quarter.</p>

Back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> was announced, we knocked it for offering zappy muzak in place of the TV show’s official theme. Gamexcite and Daedalic have added the theme, now, and I sort of wish they hadn’t. “Help!” I screeched to my bedroom walls, as the rousingly sorrowful opening bars wafted from the speakers like nitrous oxide. “A videogame is making me feel something! It is making me feel like 31 years have passed, and I can still remember Neelix getting drunk on water. I still remember the Doctor’s first words. I still remember blowing up the Caretaker Array rather than using it to insta-warp home.” 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can choose not to blow up the Caretaker Array in Across the Unknown, but I was too chickenshit to witness the consequences of leaving such a device in the hands of the bullying, bouffanted Kazon. That’s not what Janeway would have done, and while Across the Unknown’s Janeway has a certain demon Botox energy, she looks the part closely enough to command my loyalty. Let us go forth, Captain! There’s <em>coffee</em> out there in these nebulae.

<p>
We were a Star Trek/Buffy/Simpsons household back in the 90s, tuning in at 6pm sharp after school to get our fill of phasers, Spike and Moleman, save for those days when the Beeb would stiff us with an episode of Neighbors. While the spectacle of Voyager sliding over gas giant rings remains pristine in my mind, there are definitely a few bits I’ve forgotten. 
</p><p>
For example, I don’t remember Voyager spending this much time hurrying between planets to stock up on Deuterium for the warp engine. I don’t remember the crew losing faith in you if you fail to build a new storage room in time. These are the managerial intricacies they edit out of 30 minute TV episodes, but thanks to the magic of videogames, the one true artform, we are free to sigh in exasperation because we can no longer research a new transponder amplifier after running out of juice. Fortunately, power-outs don’t (so far) interfere with your ability to move around and gather resources.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t remember Tom Paris looking this avuncular. Whatever star fitfully smiled upon the conception of this game’s Janeway smirked in contempt when Daedalic gave flesh to nu-Paris. He’s so… sturdy! He still talks like the old Paris, though, which is to say, like a snarky little flyboy, and he’s fared better than Kes, who looks like she’s been dunked in custard. In general, the script approximately matches my memories of the old cast, though it’s a sparser creation with no voice-acting, carried along by dialogue choices that sort of usher you through old plotlines, while occasionally giving you the chance to deviate from canon. I haven’t done much deviating so far, unless you count sabotaging morale by failing to open a new locker room within 30 cycles.
</p>
<p>
Across the Unknown divides your labours as follows. Firstly, you click to scan and move Voyager around procedurally generated star systems, with time paused until you set a course. Secondly, you manage the ship’s interior, a cutaway dollhouse simulation akin to latter-day XCOM base management, with rooms and systems to clear and build according to a resource budget. Thirdly, you send people with different skillsets off on away missions that consist of a series of Choose Your Own Adventure challenges. Fourthly, you autobattle with 3D spaceships, giving Voyager orders that reflect the state of your shields, hull and critical systems, while performing crew special abilities with a cooldown.

After an hour mostly spent in the prologue, I wouldn’t call any of this mindblowing. It’s a bog-standard Holodeck recreation of bits of other games. It also makes me newly sad that we’ll never get to play the finished version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumplight-odyssey">Jumplight Odyssey</a>. Still, Across The Unknown doesn’t have any obvious major problems, as yet, and if your memories of the show are copious yet fading, the Proustian euphoria of recognising the specific arrangement of command chairs on the Voyager bridge may convince you to forgive the straightforward moving parts. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across The Unknown</a> is out today on Steam. The demo's still live if you fancy it.

            <p>Rubbing shoulders with factions is a big part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> charm, even if it often devolves into you doing a bunch of favours if you don't want to risk ending up on the vilified naughty list for one too many accidental grenade pickpocktings. You do get some nice perks for keeping the likes of the NCR or Legion on side, but a new mod aims to take that to a new level, letting you send faction cronies out on handy odd jobs while you kick your feet up.</p>

<p>The mod's called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96429">U_DO_IT - Faction Quest Assigner</a>' and is the work of SkullzyRS, the creator of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3433">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2466">number</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4497">of</a> popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> mods. They've recently turned their hands to New Vegas for a project I can't recall off the top of my head as having been done previously in Obsidian's radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.</p>
<p>"I love to roleplay and have always wanted to step into the shoes of NPC man and get someone to do the dirty work for me, so this is the beginning of that idea," the modder wrote in the description of their creation. "The goal would eventually be to get NPCs to actually be able to complete minor or trivial 'go there, get that, bring back' fetch quests for you while you focus on the real and exciting... fetch quests lol, but this is what I have for now as quest editing has been a notoriously bad area to play with in general, so baby steps at the moment."</p><p>In its current form, Faction Quest Assigner adds a command device to your inventory that you can use to send NPCs from eight different Mojave factions out on. These jobs are all done offscreen and range from the likes of patrolling and scavenging to sabotage and assassinations. Once you've picked a job, you pick one of four difficulty tiers to dictate how long the job'll take, what rewards you might net from it, and the percentage chance of your goons failing to complete it.</p>
<p>Naturally, the higher the risk, the higher the reward - often in caps or items, plus a dollop of positive rep with that faction. In order to limit the ability to cheese your way straight into the hearts of every group, these little missions come with a cooldown of three in-game days. Overall, I can certainly see it as the sort of mod I might use to help keep the latter stages of a New Vegas playthrough busy. Sure, by that point I'm usually off DLCing, but it's handy to have ways of making it feel like things are still happening on the war front once you reach the pint when everyone's just waiting for the second battle of Hoover Dam to kick off.</p>
<p>Plus, who could reject the idea of being able to roleplay as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-the-fallout-tv-show-season-2">Fallout TV Show season 2</a>'s Legate Home Alone. Now, if only I can get these cronies to carry me on a big throne...</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-1-041-final-update-full</link>
            <guid>1438993</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, hope you're ready to sit down and focus on one version of the game for a while, because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> just received patch 1.041 - the last patch until the DLC - and it's a pretty hefty one. Buckle up.</p>
<p>This patch, marking one year of the game since launch, makes some pretty big introductions, most notably finally bringing Arch-Tempered Arkveld into the fray, alongside 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, and a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 (which we know launches on 13th March). 
</p>
<p>
Strap in, the full patch notes are below, and they're pretty hefty. The patch weighs in at about 13GB on PlayStation, 16GB on Xbox, and 15GB on Steam.</p>
<h2>Major Additions and Changes</h2>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.
– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</p>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</p>
<p>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added. This side mission will become available after reaching HR 9+.
</p><p>– New side mission "Love for a Hero" has been added. This side mission will become available after completing the extra mission "Ghosts Pay No Heed to Tomorrow" and then talking to Nadia and Mina.</p>
<h3>Bases and Facilities</h3>
<p>– Added a new feature to the Melding Pot that allows you to meld Gogma materials.</p>
<p>– Added a new feature that allows you to earn random ingredients at the Ingredient Center after reaching HR 9.
</p>
<p>– New Appraisal Items called "Timeworn Charms" have been added to quest rewards. (No changes have been made to the attributes of Talismans earned. Chances of receiving Talismans with high rarity are increased when using Timeworn Charms.)</p>
<p>– Increased the maximum number of Pop-Up Camps for the Windward Plains, the Scarlet Forest, and the Oilwell Basin. (This will be unlocked by talking to the Pop-up Camp Meowster or the Support Desk after completing the assignment "Germination".)</p>
<p>– Added an option to the Barrel Bowling results screen that allows you to retry immediately. An option has also been added that allows you to use 10 Barrel Bowling Vouchers and receive all rewards at once.</p>
<p>– Adjusted the parameters of the Blossom Barrel Bombs used in Barrel Bowling to behave differently from the Large Barrel Bombs used out in the field. In accordance with this adjustment, new placement patterns have also been added.</p>
<p>– Reduced the waiting time between throws in Barrel Bowling, so that players can throw the second barrel while the results of the first throw are still being displayed.</p>
<h3>System</h3>
<p>– Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</p>
<p>– Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</p>
<p>– Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</p>
<p>– Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</p>
<p>– Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</p>
<p>– Performed other minor adjustments to lower the overall load.</p>
<p>– The following 9★ event quests have been made permanently available:</p>
<p>– The White Wonder
</p>
<p>– Ultimate Berserker
</p>
<p>– The Monkey King
</p>
<p>– Sovereign Brute
</p>
<p>– There Goes the Neighborhood
</p>
<p>– Added a new special environment quest. (This quest will become available after completing the existing three special environment quests as well as the 10★ Arch-tempered Arkveld event quest.)
</p>
<p>– When quick-accessing "Quest Last Played" on the top screen at the Quest Counter, the default departure point will now be set to the last departure point used. (If the last departure point used is not available, the player will start from the base camp as usual.)
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the display for event quests to make it clearer that the player is offline on the screens for accepting or joining a quest.
</p>
<p>– Added a Refresh button to the search results list for SOS Flare Quests.
</p>
<p>– Added Thai as a text language. Text language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added Latin American Spanish as a voice language. Voice language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added a "Favorited Items Safeguard" feature to the Start Menu options. This will lock the confirm button for specific facilities so that the player cannot use items that are registered as favorites. (Note: This setting can be changed back to "Require Confirmation" on the same options screen.)
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for checking the details before registering an equipment loadout for shared loadouts on the Invitation List screen.
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for going back and forth between the "Upgrade from Box" screen and "Transcending" screen at the Smithy.
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the UI for when the player approaches a Hunting Assistant (Werner or Gemma) in the field, making it easier to distinguish between the positions of Werner or Gemma and their hunting tools.
</p>
<p>– All nine permanent event quests that were only playable online have been made available for offline play as well. (Please refer to the Event Quest schedule for more details.)
</p>
<p>– Heart of Judecca (Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad)
</p>
<p>– Specter of Their Sins (Gogmazios), etc.
</p>
<p>- All 29 event quests that yield equipment materials and that were only available for a limited time have been made permanent and playable offline. (Please refer to the event quest schedule for more details.)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>– Made adjustments that should prevent the Handler from pushing the hunter while out in the field during hunts or exploration. An option to hide them completely during a hunt was also added.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue preventing some pins from being displayed and the score from being tallied correctly if the player throws a barrel right before starting Barrel Bowling.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue in Jin Dahaad, Tempered Jin Dahaad, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad quests where, under certain conditions, only the monster would move to the final area, preventing quest progression.</p>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>– Fixed an issue preventing the correct system messages from being displayed when a skill effect ends due to the player switching weapons.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Fabius could get hit by the player's slinger during Gogmazios's special attack.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue causing some items to disappear temporarily from the Radial Menu when using items like traps and such while the sword &amp; shield are unsheathed.</p>
<p>Dual Blades</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where landing a Focus Strike with the Dual Blades on Gogmazios while airborne caused the player to move erratically.</p>
<p>Bowguns</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue causing unintended elemental effects to be displayed on Artian weapons.</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue that caused an elemental resistance increase icon to appear when the "Protective Veil I" skill was active, despite the skill not having that effect.
</p>
<h3>Support Hunters</h3>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Support Hunters may fire Compact Anti-Wyvern Guns away from Gogmazios while riding Seikret.
</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Support Hunters may stop to carve Gogmazios's severed tail during the quest.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Fabius would stop guarding if the quest leader changed during Gogmazios's special attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the direction of Fabius's guard would deviate from the intended direction during Gogmazios's special attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Support Hunters would not take cover during Jin Dahaad's large area-of-effect attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Support Hunters would attack Omega Planetes instead of the Nerscylla while it was charging the Delta Attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where Support Hunters inside a shield could still take damage during Omega Planetes’s Delta Attack.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue that caused Support Hunters to be unable to get in or out of the underwater combat area during the Lagiacrus hunt.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<h2>System</h2>
<p>– During a Field Survey, if the player deals extensive damage to a large monster that isn't the current quest target, the health value conditions that would prevent that monster from becoming a target in a subsequent Field Survey have been relaxed.</p><p>– Fixed an issue where unnecessary chat logs (indicating monsters leaving the locale) could display during a Special Environment Quest in which the environment contains a monster of the same species as large monsters that are already designed to appear in that quest.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the Cosmetic DLC Pass text was not displaying correctly under Add-ons in the Support Desk menu.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the pattern thickness for the "Whitewing Caparison" decoration could not be adjusted in Seikret Customization.</p>
<p>– Added a fix to correct weapon performance when unintended bonus combinations are applied during reinforcement of Artian Weapons or Gogma Artian Weapons.</p>

<p>– Fixed various text issues.</p>
<p>– Fixed other miscellaneous issues.</p>
<p>If you're wondering when the next update for Monster Hunter Wilds is coming, we heard that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-sets-summer-2026-reveal">we're getting a Sunbreak or Iceborne-sized, "large-scale" expansion later this year</a>, with the first news about what that expansion looks like coming in summer. Series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto told us that it'd be a big patch, but other than that, we're in the dark about what it will contain.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bringing the Highguard website back up is low priority for the developers as they focus on updates and content. </p>



<p>For those unaware, right before we learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-backed-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a> was the “lead financial backer” of Wildlight Entertainment, we were also told the game’s website was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-website-is-currently-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unavailable</a>. Since then, the website has been unavailable, but the developers have finally addressed its status. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-devs-says-website-is-being-transferred-and-simplified">Highguard Devs Says Website is Being “Transferred and Simplified’ </h2>



<p>On the official Highguard <a href="https://discord.gg/euAUhFmZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via Rebs Gaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024041021231739134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>), one of the developers finally addressed the website’s situation. When asked, the developer revealed that the website was down as it was being “transferred and simplified”. They are not sure about the timeframe, as “reputational damage (is) already done,” and are currently focusing on delivering new updates and content to improve the game for players. </p>



<p>The developer was also asked whether the team would refresh the previously communicated roadmap or keep it the same. The dev responded, stating that they doubt the roadmap will be restated, as they need to target player feedback to improve, not just content. However, saying that, the developer also revealed that a “lot of that content still coming out and probably sooner.” The developer in question is a designer on the team who has worked on Wardens, Base Select, Movement, and more aspects of the game. </p>







<p>In other news, the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5v5 Raid Mode</a>&nbsp;has been made permanent. Additionally, a former Highguard dev has reflected on&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highs and lows of the game’s development and launch</a>.&nbsp;What are your thoughts on Highguard devs thinking that the website fix isn’t urgent, as ‘reputational damage’ is already done? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report has revealed that Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">ill-fated first person shooter Highguard</a>, was funded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> studio group TiMi. The full scope of this funding, its connection if any to recent layoffs, and the reason for its secrecy remains unclear.</p>
<p>The story,<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment"> broken by Stephen Totilo's Game File</a>, emphasizes that Wildlight was and remains "technically independent" from Tencent / TiMi, and notes that Tencent has a public and vast presence in funding Western Game Development. For example, Tencent is a major investor in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">and backed Ubisoft's Vantage Studios subsidiary</a>.</p>
<p>Another example of Tencent investing could be Arrowhead Studios, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent bought up a 15% stake in Arrowhead Games</a> following the release of the hugely popular PvE third person shooter.</p>
<p>However, unlike those aforementioned games, Tencent / TiMi's involvement in Wildlight wasn't publicly announced. You can't, for example, <a href="https://www.timistudios.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#games">see the game listed in the TiMi Studio Group website</a>. Why was this?</p>
<p>Well, Games Business editor in chief Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2023897547136237992">provided some context</a> to how independent studio funding works which could explain the situation. "When a big independent studio forms, they typically go through funding rounds where they ask investors to support their project/studio", Dring posted on X. "Various groups can invest in these rounds. Historically, Tencent has been a regular investor in new teams. You'd be surprised at how many other devs have 'secret' (but not actually secret) Tencent backing.</p><p>"Games require funds to be made. Being backed by investors doesn't make you any less independent. Heck, a lot of the time, the investment isn't even enough to cover everything. Multiple rounds are usually required, and even then it might need a publisher. Tencent, and similar investors, are not a well of money people can keep coming back to. In most cases, it's some funds to get going, and then it's on the developers to deliver the rest."</p>
<p>So, this all may be a lot less exciting than it initially appears. Even so, an interesting peak perhaps into the world of independent studios, how they're funded, and what that means. This report from Game File comes at roughly the same time as the Highguard website was suddenly taken down.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-18-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 18, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Place to visit</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;On the seaside</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;wooden walkway in the water</li>
</ul>



<p>If they don’t help, then here are the nine closest words, going from tenth to second:</p>



<ul>
<li>Waterfront</li>



<li>Boardwalk</li>



<li>Boat</li>



<li>Shore</li>



<li>Harbor</li>



<li>Dock</li>



<li>Jetty</li>



<li>Wharf</li>

<h2 id="h-today-s-contexto-answer-for-game-1249-on-february-18-2026">Today’s Contexto Answer For Game #1249 On February 18, 2026</h2>



<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Pier</p>



<p>A pier is a long structure sticking out from land over a waterfront, where people can walk or boats can be docked.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1249">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1249?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 19.</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Fails to be Revived by New Season Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-fails-revive-new-season/</link>
            <guid>1438966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently revealed that Battlefield 6’s development team was ‘biting their nails’ in anxiety at the Battlefield 6 roadmap. In a bid to push for a bold resurgence, Battlefield Studios tried to roll out a hefty update for the game’s second season, as well as evolving REDSEC somewhat, but it hasn’t proven to be as much of an adrenaline hit as they wanted.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> season two update was released <strong>yesterday</strong>, and it failed to bring back a considerable enough amount of players to call it a successful content drop. Similarly, viewership failed to increase, suggesting that nobody is interested in <strong>watching </strong>the game, just as much as they are losing interest in playing it.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-continues-to-backslide">Battlefield 6 Continues to Backslide</h2>



<p>When Battlefield 6 dropped in October, it was to a stellar reception that praised the game’s multiplayer platform to no end. The single-player portion was a take-it-or-leave-it delivery, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/redsec/" id="3151">REDSEC</a> turned out to be a fledgling battle royale that failed to make waves, but the multiplayer element of the game felt solid.</p>



<p>Since the game launched, interest has waned as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-studios/" id="2832">Battlefield Studios</a> has watched its player count slowly collapse. There was hope that players would either <strong>return to </strong>Battlefield 6 or <strong>discover </strong>the game with the deployment of the season two update, but that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the player count hit 92,281 as the second season was released. But on a random Sunday afternoon on January 25th, <strong>with no new content drops</strong>, the game hit 97,959 players on the same platform. The game jumped somewhat in the last 24 hours, but not enough to dub the new season a <strong>resurgence</strong>.</p>



<p>For reference, the game reached 747,440 concurrent players upon release in October 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To put this into further perspective, ARC Raiders was released just a couple of weeks <strong>after </strong>Battlefield 6 and had a peak player count of 481,966 users on Steam. In the last 24 hours, it hit a peak of 215,978 users.</p>



<p>We can then turn our attention to viewership, which hasn’t fared much better.</p>



<p>Last year, Battlefield 6 hit a whopping 868,520 concurrent viewers, a peak that few games have managed to achieve over the years. Once upon a time, more than 17,000 streamers were broadcasting Battlefield 6 at the same time.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the 24 hours that saw the arrival of season two, we saw the peak viewer count jump from about 3,000 users to 27,000, leaving Battlefield 6 as the 75th most-viewed game on Twitch. It’s possible we’d see more growth going into the weekend, which is when around 30% <strong>more people </strong>tend to consume Battlefield content, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Using ARC Raiders as another comparison point, we see the peak of 372,816 viewers at launch holds much firmer with a 24-hour peak of 116,000, which is about typical for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>It’s not Highguard levels of implosion, but Battlefield 6 players fear the counts will continue to slide as folks lose interest in the game that was designed to recapture the excitement of a floundering franchise.</p>
