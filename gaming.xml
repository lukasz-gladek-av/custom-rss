There's something deeply appealing about this style of game for me as a sort of warm-up to my day (and nice place to check in on and chill out with during the work day), and thus far, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Garden Path</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is scratching that itch well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's much more </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cozy Grove</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> than anything else in cozy sim territory, but with a fairly different tone and much more emphasis on gardening vs. other kinds of crafting. We have the requisite chill questing on behalf of cute characters, lots of checking up on plant life, foraging, fishing (though there is a different minigame afoot for actually catching them) and here, the gardening. But there's one particularly wonderful design decision that caught my eye the second I encountered it: the way the game rewards your progress. Instead of a cute journal or notebook like the aforementioned games, your achievements are marked by stars in the sky.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Garden Path to the stars">The Garden Path to the stars</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first time I brewed a cup of tea at a forest firepit (itself an adorable system that has gameplay value), the camera turned up towards the sky and showed me my first star, awarded for making that first cuppa. Stars are linked in constellations, lending cottagecore vibes that fit well with the game's aesthetic and evoking the best part of camping or spending time outdoors on a summer night: looking up at the cosmos. Other games of its ilk have hinted at the universe above: sky reflections and star fragments, objects with astronomical flair, and so on. But I do very much want to look up and star gaze when I'm in these peaceful worlds, and this gives me the chance to do just that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also evokes a certain brilliant and perhaps forgotten aspect of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario 64</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where earning a star (in a less literal sense) came with a sometimes-vague hint about how to grab another one (or a few others, depending on how you go about the game). </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Garden Path</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses the system to hint at other star achievements, in a way that feels satisfying and even a tiny bit mysterious, like a lightly signposted adventure game puzzle.

            <p>Valve looks to be introducing a new filter system to help players sift out user reviews not deemed "helpful."</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1emb4ch/valve_is_finally_addressing_bad_reviews_issue/">Steam subreddit</a>, Valve appears to have briefly activated a "helpfulness system" that essentially hid joke or silly reviews from view.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="PlayStation live-service Concord won't sell you a battle pass - would it be better if it did?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LcpqnUgV5E?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>The system has already been deactivated again, so it looks as though the feature is still under review, but a user was able to snap a screenshot whilst the trial (or premature launch) was live.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1emb4ch/valve_is_finally_addressing_bad_reviews_issue/">Valve is finally addressing bad reviews issue</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fuckingshitverybitch/">u/fuckingshitverybitch</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/">Steam</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, the "learn more" link apparently took players to a non-existent blog post, adding credence to speculation that this feature is still in development.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to know who will be the arbiter of "helpful", though, as this is currently one of Elden's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rinjvonscoot/recommended/1245620/">highest-rated reviews</a> with over 400 helpful votes: "Nothing in this game was as brutal as the moment when my son saw me fighting [a boss] and started cheering for [the boss]. 10/10."</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Steam has updated how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-improves-how-demos-appear-and-behave-in-your-library-and-the-steam-store">demos "appear and behave" within the Steam library</a>.</p>
<p>Valve said last month that with "thousands of playable demos launching on Steam every year, and millions of players trying them out, we've noticed some trends in feedback from both developers and players about the process and functionality. We've put together an update based on that feedback".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-esports-tournament-will-penalise-players-for-not-sleeping-enough.949293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/japanese-tournament-sleep-fighter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In Japan, an esports tournament called ‘Sleep Fighter’ has surfaced. It has a bizarre concept attached to it that sees players strap on a sleep monitoring device when they go to bed, and if they don’t get enough sleep, they’re penalised in the tournament. It’s a competition being played on the Street Fighter platform (hence the pun), and it’s being sponsored by SS Pharmaceuticals, which is linking the event with an initiative called the ‘Active Sleep Project’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-a-bad-thing">It’s Not A Bad Thing</h2>



<p>Gamers are notorious for not taking the best care of themselves – which is why his tournament isn’t the worst idea in the world.</p>



<p>In a statement, representatives of SS Pharmaceuticals explained why the Active Sleep Project is so important to everyone – not just gamers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By actively sleeping, you can make the most of each day and live your life to the fullest. In order to bring this ‘active sleep’ to as many people as possible, we are starting the Active Sleep Project to do our best to support those who are taking on the challenge of sleeping.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the week leading up to Sleep Fighter, players will be monitored when they head to bed, and they’ll need to get at least six hours of sleep a night. If they underdeliver, they’ll be docked points when the tournament goes live. It’s a team-based effort, so one poor sleeper could negatively impact their teammates.</p>



<p>The tournament goes live on August 31. In another twist, it was revealed that attendees to the event will need to win a lottery to qualify for a limited spot in the crowd at the Ryogoku KFC Hall in Tokyo.</p>



<p>Would you be able to succeed at this challenge, or do you hate sleeping?</p>

<p>In a new report <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/771/G077171/20240809033/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 4gamer</a>, new images of Sonic x Shadow Generations tease a modern render of popular antagonist Black Doom and the Sky Sanctuary stage.</p>



<p>The villainous Black Doom first appeared in Shadow the Hedgehog, which released nearly 20 years ago. Fans largely praised the first image of Black Doom’s updated iteration and polished details. </p>



<p>The other two fresh images of Sonic x Shadow Generations include a wide shot of Sonic cruising down a rail in Sky Sanctuary, and speeding across some interior platforms. Longtime Sonic community contributor TailsChannel also posted the new screenshots on X.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Black Doom was leader of the Black Arms, bent on invading Earth and using humanity as livestock. Sonic fans may best recognize Sky Sanctuary as the popular zone from Sonic &amp; Knuckles, an ancient temple floating in the clouds.</p>



<p>Last week, Sega confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-price-and-game-size-disclosed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price and game size</a> for Sonic x Shadow Generations after the store page went live. The Standard Edition will cost $49.99, and its file size will be 13.1 GB. </p>



<p>Sega <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-shadow-generations-revealed-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> Sonic x Shadow Generations during PlayStation’s State of Play from January 2024. It later got a new trailer during Summer Game Fest this year, confirming the release date. </p>



<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations launches on October 25, 2024. It will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, including last-gen consoles.</p>

What's surprising is that revenue from Grow Solutions (Unity's app monetization division, which houses what used to be IronSource and TapJoy) declined 9 percent year over year to $296 million. In a letter to shareholders, newly-installed CEO Matthew Bromberg cast a positive light on the news, saying the division had seen steady quarter-over-quarter growth, meaning it could make up that gap in the months ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create Solutions, the main hub for the Unity game engine, did see revenue growth despite the Runtime Fee fracas.

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick would like you to give the new Borderlands movie "a chance" because "a lot of people worked really hard on it".</p>
<p>Zelnick was asked about the film's less-than-stellar early reviews during yesterday's Q1 earnings call, and whilst he called the "look and the feel" of the movie "terrific", Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-responds-to-borderlands-movies-poor-reviews-give-the-film-a-chance">IGN</a> its performance "wouldn't have a financial impact" on Take-Two or, indeed, the Borderlands franchise itself.</p>

<p>"Let's give the film a chance. A lot of people worked really hard on it," Zelnick said.</p>
<p>"The underlying intellectual property is phenomenal, the cast is amazing, I think the look and feel is really terrific. So let's see what audiences have to say.</p>
<p>"But to answer your question, no, the performance of the film wouldn't have a financial impact on us or on the franchise one way or another."</p>
<p>The Borderlands movie has, of course, been in the works for some time now. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced</a> back in 2015 before utterly vanishing. Just as it looked like the project was dead and buried, Gearbox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hostel-director-eli-roth-is-helming-the-borderlands-movie">re-announced it</a> in February 2020, this time with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm.</p>
<p>Since then, the high-profile likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cate-blanchett-cast-in-eli-roths-borderlands-movie-adaptation">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, Gina Gershiwn, Kevin Hart, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a> all signed onto the project, giving fans at least some hope it wouldn't entirely suck.</p>
<p>But then came the reviews and… well, as Matt summarised for us yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">early impressions are not great</a>, with critics lamblasting the live-action film adaptation of Gearbox's looter-shooter as everything from a "huge misfire" to a "disaster".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The latest version of a popular Cyberpunk 2077 brings significant performance improvements with path tracing at all resolutions, as showcased by a comparison video shared today.</p>
<p>The new video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> highlights how the 5.0 version of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10490?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultra Plus Engine Control Panel mod</a>, which optimizes path tracing so that the game can run more smoothly with little impact on visual quality, brings up to 40% performance improvement. It delivers framerates close to 60 FPS at 4K resolution and ultra settings with NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 in Balanced mode. Smoothness is further improved with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, delivering an even better experience.</p>

<p>Path tracing support is only one of the many things that set Cyberpunk 2077 apart from the vast majority of open-world RPGs available on the market. Thanks to the 2.0 update, which overhauled some of the game's core systems and added more content, and the Phantom Liberty expansion, the game developed by CD Projekt Red has become a game worthy of the time of role-playing game fans. You can learn more about both by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>

<p>Blackjack is a game that has been played for hundreds of years, but it’s safe to say it’s never been played or crafted in the way that Purple Moss Collectors has done with Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers.</p>



<p>Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=roguelike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roguelike</a> that takes the simple game of Blackjack, and turns it into a battle between players.</p>



<p>The premise is pretty simple, take a deck of cards and go on a run against a variety of opponents in the classic card game. This game, however, takes that premise and turns it upside down through power ups, special cards, and a battle mechanic that attacks your opponent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just how well executed is the idea, and is Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers worth your time?</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers-review">Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers Review</h2>



<p>Things start pretty straightforward. You’ll start a run by choosing your suit, each having different base abilities. For example, choosing hearts will help heal you while clubs deal extra damage. There are a number of decks in this game, – 18 in total at launch – many to be unlocked that have different abilities to help you control the game and beat your opponents one by one.</p>



<p>Now, once you figure out your base deck, it’s time to begin your run. You start by playing a&nbsp; short starter match where you’ll then get to pick your advantage chip that could help you on your run.</p>



<p>After each match, you’ll be able to add a card to your deck. Three are usually visible while a fourth requires you to spend chips you’ve earned on your run to view.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-review-first-impressions/">Fallout London Review: Early Impressions of the Mod</a></h6>



<p>Throughout your run, you’ll also be able to make choices like staying a night in a hotel to heal or even paying a counterfeiter to secretly adjust your cards. All of these cost the aforementioned chips.</p>



<p>Each opponent plays a bit differently, some have decks built around stealing the card you’re currently playing. Others are built around forcing you to bust. But the more you play, the more you get the hang of what they’re going to do. There’s nothing that really changes things up from an opponent standpoint during a match. The biggest risk comes down to the fact that Blackjack is a game of chance. You could think you have the best deck in the world, but if your opponent just keeps hitting 21 after 21 after 21, it won’t matter.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Exploits can give you different advantages on your run.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the end of your run, there are boss fights that allow you to get to the next difficulty. Like the regular opponents, the bosses don’t change as you play them over and over. It’s main about building a deck to beat their consistent strategy and getting lucky on the draw.</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not a deck builder without being able to add special cards that change things up entirely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers has a number of cards that vary in their abilities. You have cards like The Chariot that force an opponent to stand no matter what they have. Then there’s the Blank card that allows you to set its value anywhere between 1 and 11 when played. Some, like the Jackhammer of Clubs that can deal five damage when using your advantage chip to exploit, are one-time-use cards for your run.</p>



<p>There are cards that pay homage to games like The Witcher and even make fun of NFTs in a not-so-subtle way. It’s all just good fun seeing what each card does and figuring out its inspiration.</p>



<p>There are 307 cards to collect at launch and even after nearly 10 hours of playtime, I’ve yet to collect all of them on my runs. Right now, I stand at 197 of the 307 cards collected. There’s also card and deck stickers to collect for the completionists out there that should keep you coming back.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers-review-verdict">Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers Review Verdict</h2>



<p>When looking at Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers, it’s almost a guarantee that people will compare it to the 2024 breakout hit Balatro. While the comparison can be made, in a way, it’s not a completely fair one to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers is a more traditional deck building roguelike that features battles and power ups. It just so happens to be a casino card game at its base. It’s a fun time that has this “one more run” feeling with it. I would’ve liked to see more variety in the opponents you face because it can get quite repetitive and bland after a little while. That said, it seems to subside a bit when you come across a new card that changes up your strategy entirely. It really makes the deck building aspect of the game one of the more fun ones on the market.</p>



<p>Will that remain the case? I don’t know. I haven’t unlocked every single card yet. But no matter what, this is still a game that’s hard to not recommend for those who love gambling, roguelikes, and everything in between.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-controller-pre-orders/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Astro Bot controller for PS5 is available to pre-order at Amazon, Walmart, PlayStation, and Best Buy, but they’re almost sold out universally. This adorable, on-theme peripheral was revealed a couple of weeks ago. On September 6, it’ll be released alongside Astro Bot, the full-fledged, semi-open-world game featuring PlayStation’s cute robot mascot with a price tag of just $79.99.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-already-gone">Already Gone</h2>



<p>As one of the most innovative and limited edition PS5 controllers ever made, the Astro Bot controller is understandably selling out worldwide despite not being available for almost a month. On the trackpad of this controller, PlayStation has integrated a set of animated eyes that blink and emote as you play games.</p>



<p>It’s a charming white and blue model with stunning colours, laser-etched markings, and all the bells and whistles of a typical Dualsense controller. Even at just face value, it’s one of the nicest special edition controllers I’ve ever seen, and I’m disappointed they’re proving to be so hard to come by – but that’s <strong>limited edition </strong>for you. </p>



<p>If you want to get your hands on one, you might have to wait until it’s on the market and hopefully snag one at retail <strong>or </strong>pick one up from a scalper. It’s the way of the world.</p>

He also does way too much self-promotion, but thankfully keeps his potty mouth relatively clean for once. </p><p>Remember to send us your thoughts about all the new games, TV shows, and films you're enjoying or looking forward to: ign_ukfeedback@ign.com.</p><p><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP7490261419.mp3?updated=1723211783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 761: Space Marine 2 Might Be the Warhammer Game We've Always Wanted</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"><div><p><svg focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 32 32" color="white" aria-hidden="false" role="img"><title>Loading</title><path d="M16,5 L16,9 M23.7781746,8.22182541 L20.9497475,11.0502525 M27,16 L23,16 M23.7781746,23.7781746 L20.9497475,20.9497475 M16,27 L16,23 M8.22182541,23.7781746 L11.0502525,20.9497475 M5,16 L9,16 M8.22182541,8.22182541 L11.0502525,11.0502525" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2"></path></svg></p><p><svg focusable="false" viewBox="-2 0 17 21" aria-hidden="false" role="img"><title>Play</title><path stroke="none" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M16.094 9.176c1 .6 1 2.049 0 2.649L2.341 20.092A1.545 1.545 0 0 1 0 18.768V2.232A1.545 1.545 0 0 1 2.34.908l13.753 8.268Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></p></div></output><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP4428210217.mp3?updated=1722443175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 760: Is Thank Goodness You're Here the Funniest Game Ever?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP5377107511.mp3?updated=1722001937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 759: If You Like Cameos, You'll Love Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP2670958491.mp3?updated=1721397806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 758: We Build Our Dream Sci-Fi Games</a></li><li><a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/FGADCC/traffic.megaphone.fm/SBP8187320913.mp3?updated=1720786582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN UK Podcast 757: Star Wars Outlaws, Trying and...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hunger-brings-a-horror-rpg-twist-to-the-extraction-shooter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The year is 18… something. Not that years matter anymore. Not since the End. What’s left of Napoleonic Europe is ravaged by the Hunger; people twisted by the Bacterium disease into foul, zombie-like creatures. All anyone can do in these plagued lands is survive. And complete quests. And find amazing loot. And escape to live another day. That’s life in Hunger, the next game from the developers behind Hell Let Loose. </p><p>Launching in early access on PC in 2025, Hunger is a grimdark take on the extraction shooter. If you’ve seen the debut trailer we exclusively revealed recently, you may have already drawn parallels between it and Hunt: Showdown – both share a filthy, earthy aesthetic that ground their fantastical ideas in historic reality. But Hunger is mechanically very different from many extraction shooters you may have played. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We think players will probably feel that the most unique aspect of Hunger is our replacement of the usual gear progression gameplay loop with something more akin to an RPG like Skyrim or Cyberpunk 2077, where you build a character over time and specialise them towards a certain playstyle,” explains Maximilian Rea, CEO at developer Good Fun Corporation.  </p><p>Using Hunger’s progression systems you’ll take a character (chosen from a pool of heroes, each with their own backstory) on a journey from level one to 100, with each milestone unlocking abilities from a variety of ‘Mastery trees’. Each is devoted to a particular specialisation, from combat and stealth to skills that aid teammates. “We’ve found that these allow players to really build into a certain way of playing that ends up keeping the experience fresh and allows very extreme build variety,” says Rea.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/09/screenshot-06-3200-x-1800-1723193474739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>One of Hunger's many Mastery trees, designed to allow specialisation in unique playstyles.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Rea discusses an exciting array of potential character builds and playstyles: “Some players will grab a gun and hunt other players. Some will lie in ambush and rely on stealth to surprise their enemies with an axe blow to the head, or they’ll build a character that is an escape artist. Others will spend most of their time trying to find the best loot by cracking locks. Some players will focus only on questing, or later on pursuing a profession to make money and craft useful items, and some players will focus solely on sustaining their group.” </p><p>Many extraction shooters already allow players to choose how they’ll navigate each match, but Hunger’s ambition to provide deeper specialisation that evolves over time makes its RPG systems sound more than just tacked-on numerical stats. Rea tells me that going all-in on the stealth Mastery tree morphs the play experience into something akin to the Thief games, particularly when played solo. That’s something I really like the sound of – smart gear choices in other extraction games allow you to somewhat tailor yourself to solo, competitive, or cooperative tactics, but it seems like Hunger’s potential playstyles will instead be driven by those extensive character build options.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The most unique aspect of Hunger is our replacement of the usual gear progression gameplay loop with something more akin to an RPG.</p></div><p>While my own preferences draw me to be curious about stealth, the brief snippet of gameplay in the trailer promises massive, loud guns. That’s unsurprising; before setting up Good Fun Corporation to develop Hunger, Rea and his team were known as Black Matter and created the intense WW2 shooter Hell Let Loose. “We learned a lot about creating solid gunplay when we worked on Hell Let Loose, focusing on punchy animations, satisfying recoil, and impactful sound effects,” says Rea. “Fans of our previous title will be reassured to find that we’ve improved on what we’ve learned while building an entirely new system.”</p><p>Being set in the early 1800s means Hunger can’t benefit from the chattering MG 42s that Hell Let Loose provides. But the project is not aiming to be historically accurate, and that means a wilder arsenal than history could ever provide. Yes, there’s crude flintlocks complete with slow reloads, but also a variety of “experimental jury-rigged mechanical semi automatics and automatics.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/09/screenshot-01-3200-x-1800-1723193578901.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hunger's arsenal includes a variety of fictional weapons that provide a bigger bang than period-accurate flintlocks.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The most significant difference between the team’s projects, though, is that Hunger also has a full melee combat system inspired by games like Chivalry and Mordhau. “When you swap from your rifle and draw your sabre, you’ll have a powerful and all-new combat system to learn,” says Rea. “Players may wonder how melee will be viable against ranged weapons, and we’re excited to show how that works in the future.”</p><p>Weapons and mechanics are only individual parts of combat, though – you need enemies to make it whole. As an extraction shooter the toughest foes are naturally other players, but between you and them are the Hunger. “They range from weaker, fast-moving, and fast-attacking Waif that scuttle across the floor like beetles, to the Brute—a blind behemoth who chases you around while groping at the air,” Rea reveals. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/09/screenshot-02-3200-x-1800-1723193667539.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Hunger are zombie-like humans who have fallen prey to the Bacterium. </figcaption></figure></output><p>These NPCs are more than just cannon fodder and distractions from your main objectives. “It's critical to understand that killing the Hunger rewards both experience and loot,” emphasises Rea. “You can, of course, decide to avoid fights, but we want to ensure there are incentives to engage.”</p><p>With each Hunger variant having its own strengths, weaknesses, and attack patterns, they will hopefully prove formidable opponents. The best extraction shooters use their AI enemies to inject tension, panic, and stress into encounters, and I’m looking forward to seeing how an unexpected Brute can throw a spanner into an otherwise well-planned extraction. </p><p>But before the extraction is the match itself, which in Hunger is built around completing quests. Each player in an up-to-three-person team is assigned their own quest, and once they have been completed the group can either run for the exit with the equipment they’ve secured or risk pushing on and attempting a new quest. Rea also notes that the map contains a number of other non-quest objectives and secrets that are worth seeking out: “You may decide to deal with a more challenging mini-boss style Hunger on the map. They drop great loot if you can take them down. Or you may choose to ambush other players in a certain location, or head to a small cave nearby where you know there are specific resources to gather for your profession.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/09/screenshot-04-3200-x-1800-1723193649747.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Working together to complete quests and hunt other players is key to each match of Hunger.</figcaption></figure></output><p>After successfully escaping a match with all your spoils, you’ll return to the Chateau; Hunger’s home base and player hub. Rea says it “functions much like a capital city in a roleplaying game,” and is home to vendors that allow you to craft new items, access new orders, progress your character’s professions, and more. It sounds much like Destiny’s Tower, but Rea promises that it also features “robust progression” that is “driven entirely by the story and quests.” </p><p>The extraction shooter has proven an exciting genre so far because developers have interpreted its rules in such differing ways – the dungeon-crawling Dark and Darker is a stablemate with the alien-nuking Helldivers 2, and both only have base similarities with Escape from Tarkov, the accepted father of the genre. Hunger seems to be following that trend, at least as far as Rea’s descriptions of its ideas go. We’ve sadly only been able to see a few seconds of gameplay so far, but hopefully further looks and the eventual early access release will prove Hunger has what it takes to stand alongside – and, importantly, also apart – from genre titans like Hunt: Showdown.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The Fall 2024 launch of BioWare's long-awaited fantasy RPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, is only a few months away, and the game is bringing a number of changes to the Dragon Age formula--including a reduction in the level of control players have over companions in combat. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-let-you-control-your-companions-because-you-cant-handle-it-this-is-a-much-higher-actions-per-minute-game/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>, BioWare explained the reasoning behind its decision to rework The Veilguard's companion combat system.</p><p dir="ltr">"[The Veilguard] is a much higher actions-per-minute game," game director Corinne Busche explained. "It is more technically demanding on the player. So when we tried allowing you full control of your companions as well, what we've found is it wasn't actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental, given the demanding nature of just controlling your own character."</p>

<p dir="ltr">But the reasons behind the decision to limit player control of companions goes deeper than technical logistics. BioWare felt that letting players have full control of companions in combat was problematic from a role-playing perspective as well.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the experiential side, we wanted you to feel like you are Rook," Busche said, referring to the player-character by the nickname BioWare has given them. "You're in this world, you're really focused on your actions. We wanted the companions to feel like they, as fully realized characters, are in control of their own actions. They make their own decisions."</p><p dir="ltr">Players will still be able to control some of their companions' behavior in combat via an ability selection tool BioWare refers to as the "action wheel," but Busche acknowledges that this deviation from the way combat worked in previous titles may feel a bit strange for returning players.</p><p dir="ltr">"I will admit that, on paper, if you just read that you have no ability to control your companions, that might feel like something was taken away," she said of the game's combat changes.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-publisher-says-putting-new-games-on-game-pass-isnt-rational.949176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-publisher-game-pass-rational<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Strauss Zelnick, the head of&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher Take-Two, has rejected the idea that his studio's games could end up on Game Pass on day one of their release, suggesting such an idea isn't "rational".</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-expects-call-of-duty-will-boost-game-pass-numbers-for-a-period-of-time" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Zelnick says he expects that including day-one releases on a subscription service will "push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time".</p>
<p>However, he goes on to say that Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">decision to include games like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass on day one</a> "won't affect [Take-Two's] decisions" because the publisher's decisions are "rational".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-6-take-two-game-pass-comments.jpg?itok=4elNuWR- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-6-take-two-game-pass-comments.jpg?itok=cjOl8iob 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect to see&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Zelnick's stance echoes comments he made back in 2022, when he said that including day-one AAA releases on a subscription service "doesn't make any sense to [Take-Two]" because he thinks it represents "turn[ing] our business upside down in a way that doesn't make sense economically".</p>
<p>With that in mind, if you were hoping to see&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>arriving on Game Pass on day one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">when it launches next year</a>, or even a few months down the line, you may want to stop holding out hope for that happening.</p>
<p>These comments come after Take-Two <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/606b4f51-58cd-4838-a9e2-55138ff5d8eb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released its financial summary</a> for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, showing small gains in the areas of net bookings and net revenue.</p>
<p>Take-Two points to <i>NBA 2K24&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>GTA 5</em>, as well as its online component&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>, as the main drivers of the increase in net bookings, and those games were also the key drivers behind the revenue increase, with&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Online&nbsp;</em>also contributing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/take-two-financials-red-dead-redemption-2.jpg?itok=QfItzJg8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/take-two-financials-red-dead-redemption-2.jpg?itok=1lEq5QJo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>is still trundling along for Take-Two.</figcaption></figure><p>In light of these numbers, Zelnick also told GamesIndustry.biz that he thinks his studio is in the right place when it comes to the market, pointing to recent cost-cutting measures as part of "tun[ing] up" the studio's "efficiency".</p>
<p>Those cost-cutting measures appear to include the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, the studios behind&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2"><em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a>, although Zelnick himself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied reports that the studios were closed</a> when asked.</p>
<p>When it comes to Take-Two's future pipeline, plenty of games are in the works. Between the 2025 and 2027 fiscal years, the company intends to release tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>,&nbsp;new games in the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>franchises, and&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>
<p>Take-Two's financial presentation slideshow also says that&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, the next game from&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>'s Ken Levine<i>,&nbsp;</i>will launch at some point in this broad release window, although it's seemingly too early for the publisher to commit to a definitive time period for&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>' release. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <p>Annapurna's delightful Stray will finally make its Switch debut later this year, on 19th November.</p>
<p>Whilst we knew the kitty caper was on its way to Switch courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct">June's Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Annapurna confirmed the release date yesterday, which also just-so-happened to be International Cat Day.

<p>The kitty caper - which is already available on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox - is a third-person adventure game that Eurogamer recommended when it released two years ago.</p> <div>

<p>In her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-review-fantastic-cat-exploration-through-a-dystopian-cybercity">Stray review</a>, Lottie said, "Stray captures the essence of being a cat, while delivering a deeper journey through a dying cybercity.</p>
<p>"It's by doing this - looking at the world through feline eyes - that Stray creates a journey filled with such a sense of exploration, on top of the chance to indulge in as much cat-truction as you like. While doing so, though, it also crafts a touching story about the human desires of those who, at a glance, lack humanity - be it to reunite with a loved one, protect a community or reach the outside world. The result is a wonderful mix: a game about the longing for freedom, clever climbing mechanics, and every cat’s eternal desire to knock items off shelves."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-cat-adventure-stray-is-being-turned-into-an-animated-movie">Stray is being turned into an animated movie</a>.</p>
<p>Annapurna Pictures' animation arm - which produced DNEG Animation's recently released Nimona - is planning a "respectful" adaptation of the fan-favourite cat adventure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The majority of Arcane's second and final season has been leaked online, three months ahead of its intended November launch. 
</p>
<p>
Five episodes, along with many from other animated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> shows such as Terminator Zero, Dandadan and Ranma 1/2, have been posted on social media and are now being shared around Torrent sites. 
</p>
<p>
It's a huge blow for a brilliant series that has been almost a decade in the making - six years for its initial season that debuted to universal praise in 2021, and then another three years to develop its second season this November.
</p>
<p>
On the main Arcane <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arcane/">reddit</a>, which has 200,000 subscribers, moderators are now discussing whether to shut down the board completely until November to stem the spread of leaks and ensure fans wishing to wait do not get spoiled.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-08-06/episodes-of-new-ranma-1-2-and-dan-da-dan-anime-1st-mononoke-film-leaked-online/.214035">Anime News Network</a> reports that the leaked episodes are of low-quality, and include watermarks stating they are for Netflix internal use only. It's unclear how the various episodes have leaked, and Eurogamer has contacted Netflix for more detail.
</p>
<p>
Arcane is of course the brilliant animated series based on characters from League of Legends, created for Netflix by Riot Games and talented French animation studio Fortiche.
</p>
<p>
Back in June, Netflix and Riot Games confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">Arcane's long-awaited second season would be its last</a>, but that a "larger storytelling journey" would continue based on other tales from the same world.

You play as a traveling salesman in a vaguely 1970s world, where you do odd jobs for the many locals. And hit a lot of things. It’s exactly as strange as you’d expect from the developers of <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>.</p><h2 id="h132291"><a id=""></a>How long is Thank Goodness You’re Here?</h2><p>While its objectives often require some trial-and-error to complete, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> is relatively linear and has no fail-state. That means you can’t die and are free to simply explore the world at your own pace.</p><p>As such, if you’re the kind of player who just wants to push through the town without engaging fully with its many peculiar denizens at every turn, you can wrap up <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>’s story in just <strong>two to three hours</strong>. But don’t do that, you’ll be missing out.</p><p>There’s a surprising amount of content that’s easy to overlook in <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, especially if you’re looking to obtain all of the game’s trophies or achievements. You’ll need to do things like knock on every closed door, find a lot of animals hidden in places like trash cans, and speak to certain characters at specific times during the story to move their side-stories along.</p><p>When going for this kind of full completion—especially without a guide—you can expect to spend up to <strong>six hours</strong> with <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, as you may need to run through the game multiple times to wrap up anything you missed.</p><p>There’s no denying that <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> is a relatively short game, but that doesn’t mean there’s not plenty to see (and plenty of butts to slap). More importantly, the game is such a delightful romp that it’s well worth the entry price regardless of how much time you spend exploring its wacky town.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-expects-call-of-duty-will-boost-game-pass-numbers-for-a-period-of-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new interview</a> with GamesIndustry.biz, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick commented on the impact of Call of Duty coming to Game Pass and the company’s pipeline.</p>



<p>Zelnick said that offering a frontline title like Call of Duty “day and date” could “push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time.” </p>



<p>Regarding subscriptions and Microsoft’s push to include Call of Duty in Game Pass, Zelnick stated that “it won’t affect our decisions.” They added that is “because our decisions are rational.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Zelnick also spoke about Take-Two’s recent reductions. In May 2024, reports surfaced that Take-Two could be working on a plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-is-shutting-down-its-indie-label-private-division-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down or sell</a> its indie label Private Division. </p>



<p>In the new interview, Zelnick clarifies that “we have narrowed down the pipeline to focus on the titles that we think will be the most successful.” Zelnick cited Take-Two’s three-part strategy to be the “most creative, most innovative and most efficient.”</p>



<p>They add that Take-Two cut “about $165 million out of the annual run-rate of the business.” Zelnick says that Take-Two is currently “very much” at the right size for today’s market. </p>



<p>Just yesterday, Zelnick also personally addressed rumors about the potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports</a>.  And in a new financial update this week, Take-Two Interactive revealed that the GTA 6 release window <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-release-window-unchanged-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unchanged</a>. </p>
