            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes, you need to be the adult in the room. Yes, alright, you spend all your spare time pretending to be samurai, alien soldiers or perhaps Spider-Man, but that doesn’t mean you’re immature, it just means you still have a somewhat active imagination. Japanese audio specialist Final seem to know that being a gamer doesn’t necessarily mean having the same taste in decor and fashion as an eleven-year-old, and their latest over-ear headset, the Final VR3000 EX, is a reflection of that, with some of the most grown-up vibes I’ve ever seen in a gaming headset.</p>
<p>First up is its timeless all-black colour scheme. Black earpieces, black headband, black wiring. Heck, even the logos are a different shade of black. There’s some shared design language with the Razer BlackShark, but without even a hint of neon green, leaving us with an understated, smart and serious-looking headset. By that virtue, it stands out, whether it’s against similarly sensible headsets that still flash a bit of chrome, or the RGB-heavy and gamer-centric designs from other peripheral makers.</p>
<p>The VR3000 EX feels very sturdy in your hands as well, though I did notice a little creaking when I initially took it out of the box. One of my favourite things was the quality of the headband materials, with a mesh fabric housing a significant layer of memory foam to keep things comfortable.</p>



<p>Comfort levels are furthered by the leatherette ear cushions, which are soft and pliable. They, and the earpieces themselves, provide a decent level of passive noise cancellation, but there is a downside to their sound-isolating qualities. The VR3000 EX are amongst the warmest headphones I’ve tested recently, and you’ll definitely notice the rush of cool air against your ears when you remove them.</p>

<p>The fold-up microphone is of the short and stubby variety, but it still picked up my voice clearly, despite not being all that close to my mouth. You can angle it ever so slightly towards you, but if you like an adaptable mic location, you will want to look elsewhere. Still, it’s extremely easy to tuck out of the way, and it moulds well enough into its slot that you can’t really tell it’s there if you were planning to use these headphones outside of the house.</p>
<p>The VR 3000 EX can easily leave the house with you too, as they connect via both Bluetooth 5.3 and a 2.4Ghz USB-A wireless transmitter. That means they’ll play nice with your Switch 2, your phone or tablet, as well as PS5, PS4 and PC. My only complaint was that the USB-A transmitter doesn’t work with Switch 2, meaning you’re stuck with a higher latency, lower-quality Bluetooth connection, rather than the pristine low-latency vibes afforded to Sony gamers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the audio sounds very good whichever connection method you’re using. Final have made a lot about the wide soundstage, which allows further immersion and definition to 3D audio spaces, and for a closed back headset, it’s got a great amount of natural spacing that really helps to immerse you in whatever content you’re consuming.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a heck of a lot of Final Fantasy Remake Integrade on the Switch 2, on our way to review, and the VR 3000 EX provided the perfect audio partner for Cloud’s journey from grouchy merc to slightly-less grouchy merc.</p>
<p>The orchestral soundtrack of Final Fantasy Remake does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of emotion and drama, and the VR 3000 EX sounds pretty spectacular, with a clean, detailed delivery that ensures you’re getting every single aspect of the game, from soundtrack through to the effects and expansive amount of dialogue. Out of the box, there’s a pleasant dose of bass and depth, though you can then tune this right up with the 10-band custom equaliser available in the mobile app.</p>
<p>The quality of the EQ makes the VR3000 EX a perfect partner for listening to music too, giving my regular mix of synthwave and metalcore a suitable platform to blast my ears off. It’s a shame that we’re stuck with plain old AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs, missing out on the lossless audio that’s available elsewhere, but music still sounded fantastic.</p>
<p>Listening to Starset’s newest song – it’s the soundtrack to the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ00ggFb8A0">Arknights: Endfield launch trailer</a> – the sci-fi tones of the opening and the soaring vocal chants cut through perfectly above the blasts of distorted guitar and the thump of Adam Gilbert’s drumming. It’s an excellent result, and whatever you’re listening to, it’s safe to say that the Final VR 3000 EX sound awesome.</p>
<p>There’s lots of incremental steps to the volume dial here, which is great in terms of getting things just right, but does mean you find yourself making multiple rotations at times to turn it significantly up or down. Besides that, the other controls all appear on the left-hand earcup, with the FPS-focused Footstep Clarity available via the C button, while MODE button switches between Bluetooth and the wireless dongle, with a long hold to enter pairing. It’s pretty straightforward once you’re clear on the headset’s options.</p>

<p>That said, Final are trying their best to confuse me with the way they’re doing mobile apps. Previously, the Final Connect app controlled a bunch of their earbuds, including the very similarly named <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/12/final-vr3000-wireless-earbuds-review/">VR3000 earbuds</a>, but their two most recent headsets have their own, single headset app. Now, for most people, that probably won’t cause any issues, but for me, it’s just a weird bit of needless phone bloat.</p>
<p>The app is a fairly no-frills affair, but the equaliser is responsive and offers enough variability that you’ll definitely be able to tune the audio to exactly where you want it to be. Besides that, you can activate the Footstep mode here, update the firmware, or read the manual, and that’s pretty much your lot. It’s as straightforward and unassuming as the headset itself, doing exactly what you need, without any hassle or complication.</p>
<p>Currently available for £89.99, the VR3000 EX is great value, especially given its dual connection options and demure looks. It’s right in the same wheelhouse as the latest <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth 500</a>, which is definitely lighter and less warm, but lacks the solidity and build quality of the VR3000 EX. The quality of the audio and the wider soundstage of the Final headset take you that step further in terms of immersion too, but the Stealth 500 edges it in overall comfort.</p>

<p>This news come <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">directly from Hasbro</a> itself, with the firm confirming the appointment of Bowser alongside Carla Vernón, CEO of The Honest Company, a digital-first consumer goods company founded by actress Jessica Alba.</p>
<p>Hasbro, of course, is much more than a mere toy manufacturer, and owns the trademarks and products of Kenner, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, and Wizards of the Coast. The latter company is responsible for the ludicrously popular <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> and <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>, while huge brands like <strong>Transformers</strong> and <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> also fall under Hasbro.</p>
<p>Here's what Rich Stoddart, Chair of Hasbro's Board of Directors, had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are delighted to have Doug and Carla join our seasoned and dynamic Board of Directors. Doug and Carla bring extensive leadership experience across consumer brands and franchise management. Their expertise and guidance will be invaluable as Hasbro continues to execute its long-term innovation and growth strategy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Doug Bowser's successor at Nintendo, Devon Pritchard, has kicked off 2026 as Nintendo of America's new President and COO. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/im-excited-to-meet-you-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-public-appearance-as-president-of-noa">She made her first public appearance</a> in the role at the 15th Annual New York Game Awards, delivering a pre-recorded message to praise the event and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme.</p>
<p>Chances are we won't see much of Doug Bowser in the months and years ahead as he works behind the scenes at Hasbro, but hey, maybe he'll have a say in whether <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> comes to the Switch 2, huh?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Unveils a “Really Good Batch” of Xbox Game Pass Games for the Rest of January 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-death-stranding-space-marine-2-talos-principle-2/</link>
            <guid>1410838</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of tomorrow's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a>,</strong> the rest of the games coming to <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> for January 2026 and heading into February have been revealed, with an additional <strong>10 games</strong> joining the subscription service, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a></strong>, and <strong>The Talos Principle 2.</strong></p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-games-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws/">games already added from the start of the month</a>, which one user described as a "<em>damn good month</em>," another user on ResetEra called this back-half a "<em>really good batch</em>" of games. In total, subscribers get <strong>17 new games</strong> to check out as part of their Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Premium members only miss out on three of the titles joining the service this month, whereas anyone on the Essential tier is missing out on, well, all of them. </p>



<p>So far, since <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Microsoft raised the prices on Game Pass subscriptions and reorganized it</a></strong> into the three tiers (Ultimate, Premium, and Essential), it's been clear that the bottom 'Essential' tier is really just for those who want to be able to use Cloud services and play games online. If you want access to the Game Pass library of games, you need to be at least at the middle-level Premium tier, and Microsoft makes subscribers aware of this every time a new batch of Game Pass games includes nothing for players on the Essential tier.</p>



<p>On the flip side, while Microsoft is seemingly making players aware that Essential is the worst deal among the Game Pass options, it is also consistently making them aware that just paying for PC Game Pass is the best deal. Of course, this isn't a good option for console players, but if you have the means to just play on your PC, it's easily your best bet as you're still getting everything Ultimate subscribers are getting at a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>But if you're paying for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or even just Game Pass Premium, then beyond the aforementioned titles like Space Marine 2, The Talos Principle 2, and Death Stranding, you also have 2024's indie hit, <strong>Indika</strong>, 2025's excellent action-platformer, <strong>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</strong>, and the physics-driven driving sim, <strong>RoadCraft</strong>, to look forward to this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Xbox Game Pass for the rest of January 2026, when they'll arrive, where you can play them, and what subscription tier you need to be at to access them:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding: Director's Cut - January 21 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>RoadCraft - January 21 - PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound - January 21 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Talos Principle 2 - January 27 - PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Anno: Mutationem - January 28 - Cloud, PC, Console - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Drop Duchy - January 28 - Cloud, PC, Console - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>MySims: Cozy Bundle - January 29 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - January 29 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Indika - February 2 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Final Fantasy II  - February 3 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>As always, with games coming into the service, others are leaving. As of January 15, five games were removed from the service, most notably Neon White. This time, on <strong>January 31, 2026</strong>, an additional six games are leaving the service, with a couple of notable departures, including Citizen Sleeper 2 and Lonely Mountains Snow Riders.</p>



<p>You have until January 31 to play the following six games through Xbox Game Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shady Part of Me</li>



<li>Starbound</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains Snow Riders</li>



<li>Paw Patrol World</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li>



<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</li>
</ul>

<figcaption><em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>is all about formation and unit tactics.</figcaption>

<p>As "increasingly complex tactical scenarios" play out, <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will throw new challenges at you, including the use of artillery, which Tactical Board says "emphasizes the importance of troop maneuvering" as well as "reinforcing the importance of positioning and timing" in battle.</p><p>Despite this strategic depth, the studio says <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will offer "accessible, fast-paced gameplay", so if you're not a real-time strategy genius, then you should still find something to enjoy here.</p><p>Unlike many other RTS games, this one won't offer any multiplayer features, either; Tactical Boar says the game will be "a focused single-player experience", so don't expect to be taking on your friends here anytime soon.</p><p>You can check out the debut trailer for <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which should be red meat for you if you're a <em>Total War </em>fan (and you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7067fdbf-b9ab-4e47-903f-e0733b54d97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">disappointed with more recent releases</a>), right here.</p>
<p>There is, admittedly, not a ton of information in said trailer, but <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>doesn't have a release date yet, so that's probably fair enough.

<p>That's exactly what the RuneScape makers have done to kick off the opening section of the 2026 roadmap they talk through in the video above and <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-roadmap-that-changes-runescape-forever">this post</a>. The gist of what they've dubbed the game's "Road to Restoration" is that they're hoping to make sure that RuneScape's put firmly back on track and set up for a bright future as it rings its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Hence the ditching of the Treasure Hunter microtransactions, with their items set to be driven into extinction in the long-run to boot. "Over the course of 2026, players will have the opportunity to use up any existing stockpiles, with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before these items are ultimately made obsolete," Jagex wrote.</p><p>Along with Treasure's removal, the winter update which has just gone live delivers a few other bits. There's a retooled user interface designed to work back in some classic RuneScape furniture like a circular minimap and the option to toggle cosmetics like wings into an invisible form if they bother you. plus, there's been a worldspace update focusing on free-to-play locales like Lumbridge, Draynor, and Varrock.</p>
<p>Moving forward through the rest of the year, regular larger additions like the two-part Havenhythe expansion, player-owned housing, and player avatars will be packaged with more revamping of existing features. For example, spring promises a combat update that'll aim to modernise the three base fighting styles by adding the likes of a basic attack and retooling abilities which are no longer fit for purpose, while three rounds of general balancing tweaks are penned in across the year. The RuneMetrics stat-tracking system is also set to drop the Pro part of its price of entry, instead being offered to all paid RuneScape members.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like a number of steps in the right direction, albeit with the caveat of Jagex needing to do all of this re-integritising because they'd jumped so far into the integrityless microtransaction waters to start with.</p>

              <p>In a splendidly combative interview with Razer’s billionaire CEO Min-Liang Tan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview"><em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel took him to task</a> over the peripheral company’s approach to AI, not least including the Grok-powered <a href="https://kotaku.com/grok-hologram-anime-waifu-ces-2026-2000657749">waifu-AI-in-a-jar stunt</a> it pulled at this year’s CES. The hour-long interview gets more and more uncomfortable as it becomes clear Tan has no answers for any of the crucial questions Patel is putting to him. And just wait until he’s asked what games he’s played recently.</p> <p>The interview, which took place live on stage at 2026’s CES, has such a peculiar tone. <em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel makes pretty obviously cynical remarks about Razer’s approach in terms of the attention-seeking silliness it pretends to be developing, and Min-Liang Tan replies as if the questions are entirely sincere. Of the Ava AI tube, “Did you say to your team, ‘I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk’? You say the metric is ‘what we want.’ Who was like, ‘I want this’?” asks Patel. Tan then launches into a deeply sincere response about how the holo-lady was there to represent technology Razer can create for game companies, meeting an imagined desire for “a holographic representation of some of your latest characters,” and that the product demonstrates “we’re now able to get personality there and have conversational AI coming through,” and further that it isn’t just “great software” but now features “great intelligence.”</p>

 <p>As impossible as it is to think of a single use-case for a game character appearing in a physical tube and being able to spurt Grok responses back at people, Tan enthuses, “It’s that premise of being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.” It’s “a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, ‘Hey, it’s a great concept,’ and I think the community loves it.”</p>  <p>Ava, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava">which has a website</a> that’s taking $20 preorder deposits and states that the product “is expected to be available in the second half of 2026,” is certainly not going to be released then, if at all, as becomes awkwardly obvious as the interview continues. When pressed on the reality of Ava actually being developed as a consumer product, rather than something “hack[ed] together” for CES, Tan starts to prevaricate. “We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on?” Which are all <em>really</em> strange questions to be asking of a product that’s supposedly going on sale later this year. Not least one that’s planning to run on Grok, Elon Musk’s wildly unstable and poorly managed AI.</p>

 <p>“Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?” asked Patel, with the interview taking place as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">the stories of Grok’s gleeful creation of revenge porn and CSAM</a> were breaking. Tan does not answer the question at all, but rather speaks of Grok’s “really great conversational AI model.” When Patel puts to him the other obvious issues of a Grok-powered conversational device, Tan gives some of the most astonishingly dreadful responses, such as declaring, “Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi,” and “we’ve interacted with NPCs.” Patel desperately persists, laboring over the point that intentions are meaningless when we all know what gen-AI is already doing, but Tan refuses to engage, instead just repeating the usual lines about “software guardrails” and how the tech is [deep sigh] “evolving.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661262">© Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>Patel continues heroically on. When asking Tan about glowy-keyboard company Razer’s intentions to invest $600 million into “AI” alongside employing 150 AI engineers, the host points out “that gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms.” This obviously hits rather close to home for the Razer CEO, who arrived at CES under the banner of “AI is the future of gaming.”</p> <p>Tan attempts to draw a line between the “AI slop” that most game players are currently revolting against, and the nebulous “AI tools” that will help developers with QA and cause them to “develop better games.” He talks of a “QA companion” that Razer is developing to “work with the human QA tester” by, um, filling in forms. Genuinely, that’s the example.</p>

 <p>But as much as Patel pushes, Tan never provides an actual example of a compelling use case. Instead it’s all about how “helpful” it will be, how it’ll “work with” current products, but never with a single concrete example of what he’s actually talking about. But it is, of course, “revolutionary.” Thank goodness for Patel, who jumps in at this point to demand that Tan explain what exactly is “revolutionary” about putting a camera with “AI” in it in some headphones in Razer’s Motoko. The answer: “Well, I would say, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.” Ho boy. It’s ChatGPT talking at you in your ears. And, more specifically, an imaginary future version of ChatGPT that can interpret live camera footage and ambient audio and provide related answers based on these feeds.</p> <p>And for all of Tan’s protestations that Razer isn’t interested in “slop,” he then goes on to deliver that hoary old line, “We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout.” So yeah, just plagiarized slop then.</p> <p>And just in case it couldn’t get any worse, Patel finishes up by asking Tan—who repeatedly declared his love for gaming throughout—what games he’s playing right now. “Oh, it depends.” Nope. On a second try he says, “<em>Civilization</em> and stuff like that…I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre.” Patel points out those are genres and desperately presses for the name of a game. “Oh, well, I play random stuff.” Fucking hell.</p>

            <guid>1410817</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping multiple devices charged has become a daily challenge. Smartphones are just the starting point—add in wireless earbuds, smartwatches, tablets, laptops, and handheld gaming consoles, and it’s easy to see how quickly outlets and charging bricks multiply. A single, powerful charger that can handle everything is no longer a luxury. It is an absolute necessity. That’s why you need an Anker laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Amazon happens to have it on sale at the moment for 35% off. It normally runs for $100, so that discounts easily calculates out to a savings of $35.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Charging</h2>
<p>Designed as an all-in-one charging hub, this compact power brick is built to replace several individual chargers at once. It supports USB-C charging across a wide range of devices, from phones and accessories to full-sized laptops and gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or similar handhelds. With a maximum output of up to 140W, it delivers a ton of power fast helping to minimize the time it takes to bring your devices back to life.</p>
<p>At the front of the charger, you’ll find three USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port, allowing you to charge up to four devices simultaneously. The first two USB-C ports support the highest power output, so either can be used for fast-charging a laptop without sacrificing performance. The USB-A port ensures compatibility with older cables and accessories you may still rely on, keeping the charge valuable for even your legacy devices.</p>
<p>Fast charging performance is a highlight. The Anker Laptop Charger is capable of powering larger devices and laptops like the 15-inch MacBook Air rapidly. Under optimal conditions, it can bring a drained laptop battery up to 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>



<h2>Smart Display</h2>
<p>A built-in smart display located on the top of the unit provides real-time charging information, breaking down how much power each port is delivering as well as the total output across all connected devices. The high-definition, full-color display makes the information easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>The display also doubles as a temperature monitor. Keeping charging temperatures in check is critical for both safety and long-term device health, and the charger gives you visibility into how warm it’s running. Behind the scenes, Anker’s ActiveShield safety system continuously monitors temperature—checking millions of times per day—to protect against overheating and ensure stable performance.</p>
<p>In the box, Anker includes the 140W charger itself and a five-foot USB-C to USB-C cable rated for up to 240W, so you can take full advantage of its capabilities right away. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Available in dark gray or silver, the Anker laptop charger is now on sale for just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is getting a cross-progression update on February 3, 2026. </p>



<p>It has been a long time since we received an update for Hitman: World of Assassination. The last update we saw was a big one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eminem-joins-hitman-world-of-assassination-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eminem</a> was announced as part of an Elusive Target Mission in the game. Now, the latest update doesn’t feature any content, but it’s still handy for players who play across different platforms. </p>







<h2 id="h-hitman-world-of-assassination-cross-progression-details">Hitman: World of Assassination Cross Progression Details </h2>



<p>As revealed in the new <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Hitman: World of Assassination’s Cross-Progression update will allow players to carry their in-game progression to any device they choose. Ahead of the update, a Steam patch will be released to ensure the feature works properly before it is released to the public. </p>



<p>While the Cross Progression feature is enabled, players can store and share their progress online across devices linked to the user’s IOI account. One device will serve as their primary progression profile, and all other platforms will be linked to it. While using cross-progression in Hitman: World of Assassination, Game License, DLC License, and DLC-based unlocks will not be shared, only the following data is shared across all platforms: </p>



<ul>
<li>Experience&nbsp;</li>



<li>Player Level&nbsp;</li>



<li>Challenges&nbsp;</li>



<li>Location Mastery&nbsp;</li>



<li>Unlocks and Inventory&nbsp;</li>



<li>Achievements / Trophies&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freelancer Mode Progression&nbsp;</li>



<li>Campaign Story Progress&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The DLC content should be owned on the platform they are playing, or else it won’t be accessible. Additionally, old save games from non-primary devices cannot be loaded via cross-progression; to load them, you will have to turn off the feature. Additionally, the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover process will be disabled from February 3, once cross-progression launches for Hitman: World of Assassination. </p>







<p>In other news, Hitman 4 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-4-unofficially-confirmed-by-io-interactive-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unofficially revealed</a> by the IO Interactive CEO last month.

            <title><![CDATA[Russia’s ‘Call of Duty’ Could Cost 10 Billion Rubles, But The Government is Ready]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/russia-call-of-duty-10-billion-rubles-government-ready/</link>
            <guid>1410808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Russia is still preparing to make good on a promise to create a homegrown rival to Call of Duty. The dream is edging closer to reality, as government ministries signal they are prepared to offer immense financial support, tax breaks, and other incentives to <strong>any Russian studio </strong>willing to take on the gargantuan task.</p>



<p>The idea, which was first pushed by State Duma deputy Mikhail Delyagin, has now procured an official response from Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development. The numbers being lobbied are <strong>staggering</strong>, and the appropriate bodies could grant as much as <strong>10 billion rubles </strong>($128 million) to the right studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-russia-s-call-of-duty-clone-could-become-reality">Russia’s Call of Duty Clone Could Become Reality</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve discussed Russia’s gaming aspirations in recent years. In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/">Vladimir Putin ordered</a> Russian tech titans to manufacture a range of home consoles that could eventually compete with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. That front has gone somewhat quiet, but a new, software-based dream has emerged.</p>



<p>Russia wants to make a Call of Duty competitor.</p>



<p>According to an original report from <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2026/01/20/27657577.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gazeta.Ru</a> (and circulated by <a href="https://ixbt.games/en/news/2026/01/20/instituta-razvitiia-interneta-podderzit-sozdanie-rossiiskogo-analoga-call-of-duty.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IXBT</a>), the ministry <strong>confirmed </strong>that developers who propose a large-scale military shooter that echoes Activision’s Call of Duty could qualify for support from the Internet Development Institute, one of Russia’s key state-funded digital initiatives.</p>



<p>But how much support is the government offering?</p>



<p>Early estimates suggest that building a Russian AAA shooter on par with Call of Duty could cost as much as 10 billion rubles, or around $124 million. It would easily make it amongst the most expensive gaming-related projects in the nation’s history. It <strong>has </strong>been stressed before that ‘no domestic studio’ could accomplish the task without substantial government support.</p>



<p>Hence, the lobbying for a potentially enormous grant.</p>



<p>The quote from the Ministry reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the IRI receives an application for the allocation of funding for the development of a game on a topic corresponding to that indicated in your letter, it will be considered in the established procedure within the framework of the current competitive mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond potential funding, the Ministry of Digital Development reminded Russian reporters that the government offers a ‘suite of financial benefits’ for IT companies innovating like this. That includes reduced corporate income tax rates, lowered insurance premiums, and partial VAT exemptions.</p>



<p>This news comes mere weeks after the State Duma, the ‘lower house’ of Russia’s parliament, called for an investigation into Call of Duty. By their claims, the franchise preaches Russophobia, by ‘always’ making the ‘bad guy’ a Russian individual or group.</p>



<p>It has been suggested that Russia’s Call of Duty would flip the script, allowing users to fight against American, British, and Ukrainian forces. It was dubbed a ‘strategically important’ game for Russia, but whether it would leave the confines of the country is another thing entirely.</p>







<p>Do you think Russia’s game developers could ever muster up the ability to create a Call of Duty rival? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Following the reveal of its release date, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a> has seen a surge of interest as PC players have begun locking in preorders for Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooter. At the time of writing, Marathon is the fifth-best-selling game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" rel="nofollow ">Steam in the US</a> and 10th globally on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" rel="nofollow ">Steam Charts</a>. Free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals and Counter-Strike 2 are ahead of it--only natural, given the low price of nothing for those titles--and Arc Raiders is still in the top spot for now.</p><p>This is a positive step forward for the game, considering last year's controversy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/">over alleged stolen art assets</a> and the lukewarm reception since its reveal. It's also worth noting that Marathon will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S at launch, but sales data for those platforms isn't currently available to gauge player interest. Marathon was originally aiming to launch in September last year--a release date that would have brought it perilously close to the mega-successful Arc Raiders.</p>

      </div>
<p>It's now scheduled to launch on March 5, which gives it a fairly comfortable window to make its sales mark. The Steam preorders suggest it'll launch on PC with considerable momentum, but it remains to be seen whether it'll be able to hold onto its players in the highly competitive live-service games market.</p><p>With its release date drawing closer, Bungie has begun to lift the lid on what it has been cooking for the last couple of years. The $40 game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-reveals-an-absolutely-stacked-voice-cast/1100-6537488/">features a stacked cast of talented voice actors</a>, details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-new-rook-shell-is-a-big-win-for-solo-players/1100-6537430/">various Runner shells</a> have been revealed, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathons-recommended-system-requirements-have-been-revealed/1100-6537487/">PC requirements for the stylish game aren't too high</a>. Sony has also shown off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-dualsense-controller-preorder-guide/1100-6537489/">limited-edition DualSense controller inspired by the game</a>, and preorders for it open soon.</p>

<p>On Death Stranding's initial release, we here at Eurogamer were quite taken with it. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s first post-Metal Gear game is a messy, indulgent vanity project - but also a true original," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-review-a-baffling-haunting-grand-folly">Eurogamer's Death Stranding review</a>, with former editor Oli Welsh slapping it with a Recommended badge. He called it all a "baffling, haunting, grand folly".</p><p>Then we have Indika, which is another favourite among the team. In Indikia, players take control of the titular nun, who is looking to adjust to a monastic life. However, she also has a connection with none other than the devil. Our Matt described Indika as "a dark, surreal, and devilishly playful drama" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indika-review">Eurogamer's four star review</a>.</p>
<p>"Bleak realism meets absurdist fairytale in a stylish, surreal, and astonishingly sure-footed - if mechanically unadventurous - exploration of faith, free will, and demonic temptation," he wrote of Indika.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-Bungie Dev On Marathon‘s Summer Of Hate: ‘You Can’t Take The Thing I Care About The Most Away’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-director-budget-development-2000661252</link>
            <guid>1410769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The buzz around <em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">was strong coming out of its initial 2023 PlayStation Showcase reveal</a>. It was a familiar multiplayer formula inside a wrapper that looked unlike anything else out there. But things started going downhill after fans went hands-on with an alpha test build in May 2025. Coupled with an <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">art plagiarism scandal</a> and annual mass layoffs at Bungie, the vibes had turned rancid. Fans were skeptical and haters were gleefully calling <em>Marathon</em> the next <em>Concord</em>. What does that do to the headspace of someone working on the game internally?</p> <p>“That kind of stuff hits everyone differently,” <em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">former franchise art director, Joseph Cross</a>, said in a new interview with <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">Mikhail Klimentov’s <em>ReaderGrev</em> newsletter</a>. “We had both spells, where there was a lot of positivity and then there was a lot of negativity. Personally, I’m able to compartmentalize a lot of that. And a big part of the reason I’m able to do that is just because, getting back to my own identity as an artist, the art is really the most important thing to me here.”</p>

 <p>Cross, who’s worked outside games on film projects like 2021’s <em>Dune</em>, said he ultimately can’t control how players feel about the game design or how <em>Marathon</em> plays. “It’s difficult for me to take any of that stuff personally because I believe in the art, because I believe in what we’ve done,” he said. “I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out. I can’t control the way the game plays. I’m not a designer. I’m not the game director. I can only control what I can control, and what I could control, I feel really good about.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>And you can’t take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever, and whether someone doesn’t happen to like the art direction personally, whether they don’t agree with some political thing Bungie did, or whatever the animosity du jour is, you can’t take the thing I care about the most away. There’s a part of me definitely that feels bummed, but sort of in the same way you feel bummed like you got unlucky. It’s like when you drop the toast and it goes face down. It’s like: Damn, I wish it would have gone face up when I dropped the toast. It feels like losing a lottery ticket or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And that stuff never feels personal, you know?</p></blockquote> <p>As a manager, Cross added that it can be hard to know how everyone else on the team is processing the noise, especially when people are working remote through Zoom and Slack. “In my position, it’s not enough to just process it internally,” he said. “You have to advocate for and be there for the team and for the project and that’s a whole other can of soup.”</p>

 <p>Something that did weigh on the veteran Bungie artist is what a big risk and investment <em>Marathon</em> is, and what all that effort means if it ends up not paying off. The people comparing it to <em>Concord</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">which took many years to develop and cost over $200 million</a> to make, are not entirely wrong in that regard. Cross pointed to that risk taking as one of the project’s virtues, but worries it could be part of a dying breed of AAA project that studios like Bungie have made their bread and butter.</p>

 <p><i>“Marathon</i> is such a massive project,” he said. “The studio took such a risk on this. You know, often times we felt like we were sort of getting away with something. And I think about that in the big picture, the idea of studios funding unproven, unknown projects for six or eight years, for hundreds of millions of dollars, sort of on spec. How much longer are things like this going to exist? I’ve been part of a couple of them now.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Mac Mini, Amazon Clears Out Ryzen 7 Mini Gaming PC at Record Low (Windows 11 Pro, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-mac-mini-amazon-clears-out-ryzen-7-mini-gaming-pc-at-record-low-windows-11-pro-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000661033</link>
            <guid>1410766</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC upgrades don’t always require shelling out big bucks, if you know where to look. Those looking for a compact, space-saving, but powerful (and cost-effective) solution should consider the Acemagic mini gaming PC at Amazon, which offers the best of both – or well, all – worlds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/">This PC retails for $599, but shoppers can grab it for less today.</a> Amazon Prime members can snag it for $408, after a nice 32% drop, while non-Prime shoppers can pick it up for $469 ($61 more than Prime members), which still knocks 22% off the list price. All shoppers will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact, But Powerful</h2>
<p>This mini PC is truly compact. It easily fits in the palm of your hand and can squeeze into tighter, cluttered workspaces with ease. If you prefer a cleaner, more minimal setup, you can even mount it behind your monitor, or under the desk to keep it out of sight.</p>
<p>Performance is seriously impressive. The mini PC comes equipped with an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor that clocks up to 4.5GHz. When compared with its predecessors like the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U, this PC delivers around 35% faster CPU and 38% better GPU performance. It’s made to handle 1080p gaming, light editing, regular work, and even multitasking without slowing down. The PC is perfectly capable of supporting your work needs in the day, and entertainment sessions with games like APEX, CSGO, PUBG, COD, DOTA2, RUST, GTA5, and more at night.</p>



<p>There’s a massive DDR4 32GB RAM (dual channel), which keeps things snappy as you push through busy days. It keeps the system running smoothly, even when you’re working on a heavier, resource-intensive project that demands power. Storage is taken care of by the built-in 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 SSD. It’s spacious enough to house all your important files, work documents, research papers, high-resolution photos, videos, and more comfortably. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage are expandable up to 64GB and 2TB, respectively. That means if your needs grow in the future (which is inevitable), the system can grow to support them. You won’t need to worry about major overhauls anytime soon.</p>
<p>Port selection is decent. A triple monitor setup is supported with HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), DP, and dual USB 3.2 Gen2 ports, letting you juggle a bunch of tasks at the same time. Think taking work meetings on one screen, while working on your project on the primary one, and having reference material opened on the third. Or playing a game on your main screen, while also catching up with friends on the other. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating, either. That’s thanks to the dual-vent cooling system, which maintains optimal 15-28W TDP performance without throttling.</p>
<p>The PC plays nicely with a variety of operating systems, but comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, meaning it’s ready to be used right out of the box. It’s also certified for AutoCAD/Adobe suites, which makes it great for work professionals, creatives, gamers, and students alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6787/">The PC is now down to $408 for Prime members, and $469 for non-Prime users.</a> The discounts offer a great way of upgrading your system without paying the full price.</p>

Yet the contrast between that no-nonsense offense and the whimsical stylings of his older brother, Dong Hwan, creates a shadowy specter of doubt: How should he really fight? How can he keep up with them both? Fueled by burning questions of self-worth, and a burning desire to punish all manner of evil in South Town, Jae Hoon sets his sights on one place: the infamous King of Fighters tournament.</p></blockquote><p><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,583 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,659 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,293 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492040/FATAL_FURY_City_of_the_Wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/garou-city-of-the-wolves-556c5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>World of Warcraft lead producer Raymond Bartos has left Blizzard to join Riot, where he will work on the League of Legends developer's upcoming MMO.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bartos said</a>, "I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started." Serving as a senior game producer, Bartos said his job will be to "help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p><p>Additionally, Bartos said he's excited to join another former WoW developer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orlando-salvatore-03772915/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orlando Salvatore</a>, at Riot. "Given our track record on World of Warcraft, I have a feeling we'll be moving fast on day one," Bartos said.</p><p>He joins Riot following the developer's announcement in 2024 that it was resetting its MMO project, saying it will go back to the drawing board and stay silent for "years to come" as it reshaped the project. The MMO was originally announced as a League of Legends game set in the world of Runeterra. The game had been in the works since at least 2020 prior to its "reset" in 2024.</p><p>As announced previously, ex-Bioware and EA developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcondominas/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fabrice Condominas</a> is serving as the game's new executive producer.</p><p>Riot had always expected its MMO project to take time to materialize. The game's former executive producer, WoW veteran Greg Street, said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-guarantee-league-of-legends-mmo-will-ship-producer-says-but-development-is-going-super-well/1100-6502412/" data-ref-id="1100-6502412">"no guarantee" the game would ever be released</a>, as the team wouldn't ship a game it thought would "disappoint players." Street left Riot in March 2023 after nine years with the company to start his own studio, Fantastic Pixel Castle, which is now making a AAA MMORPG under the codename Ghost, funded by NetEase.</p><p>Riot has also been in the news lately regarding the game Hytale. The company canceled the game in 2025, but its original developer bought the rights from Riot and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-is-off-to-quite-the-strong-start-with-impressive-twitch-viewership-numbers/1100-6537390/" data-ref-id="1100-6537390">released the game just recently to big success.</a></p><p>And in other MMO news, Amazon Games just announced that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-big-mmo-that-started-strong-is-shutting-down/1100-6537436/" data-ref-id="1100-6537436">MMO New World will shut down in January 2027.</a></p>

Executive producer Damon Conn said in an interview that Microsoft's goal is to "bring players back together."</p><p>"There are people who have never been exposed to Halo. Maybe they've always been on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/" rel="nofollow ">Sony</a> products, switched consoles at a certain point, or just missed it at the time. We want to bring players back together," Conn explained to GamesRadar.</p><p>Creative director Max Szlagor added that, "Halo is best played when we have a large, healthy community."</p><p>Releasing Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5 is a "way to grow, expand, and reconnect the Halo community," Szlagor said.</p><p>"We want to honor the Halo legacy on PlayStation, and we're paving the way to expand our Halo universe--that's how we see it," Conn added. "And it's not a small thing. We don't and we won't take it lightly. We definitely feel the weight of it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjbIM0iegY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Releasing Halo on PS5 is also a way for Microsoft to make a lot of money potentially.

<p>Developer Kenny Sun is also promising eight new balls as part of the Regal Update, as well as new passive abilities and "some new features many [players] have been crying out for since launch".</p><p>He's also teasing a "nice surprise" that he and his fellow <em>Ball x Pit </em>devs "don't want to spoil just yet".

            <p>The winter abates, the days begin to lengthen, the snowdrops creep forth from their burrows, and the raiders of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> carry on raiding Arcs. Developers Embark have also done another round of interviews, in which they discuss plans for ARC Raiders updates in 2026, and in particular, address the question of whether to implement a player-trading menu and/or some kind of auction house feature. Right now, you can only officially barter with NPC merchants. 
</p>
<p>Briefly, the developers are concerned that such features would sabotage how players themselves organically assign value and significance to particular items. They worry it would encourage us to see everything as currency – an argument that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">echoes thoughts to RPS</a> from the launch period last year. They’re keen to maintain the enchantment of encountering another wanderer in the waste, and trading items by dropping them on the floor. They sort of don’t want it to feel too much like an “extraction” game, in effect. Ideally, all of that stuff needs to happen in the world itself.
</p>
<p>"We're not building an auction house or anything like that,” design lead Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-had-an-auction-house-style-trade-system-at-one-point-but-embark-removed-it-because-it-ruined-loot-it-turned-the-game-into-just-being-about-coins/">Gamesradar</a> in an interview. “Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.”
</p>
<p>As an example of this “social facilitation”, the devs are looking at letting you actually hold out an object to another player, rather than chucking it at their feet (and daring them to let their guard down a fraction while they push the button to pick it up).
</p><p>Watkins had more to say on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/2026-plans-embark-interview">PCGamesN</a>, describing player-trading as a “very tricky aspect” of games like ARC. "You can see it in other games that have like a more traditional auction house, especially once [in-game] currency becomes involved, I think we [would] diminish one of the central aspects of our game, which is caring about the items you find and what [their] use cases are,” he said, “rather than it being: 'I'm going to go into the world to maximize profit, take all that money out, and then just buy the things I need.'
</p>
<p>"I think any avenue we go down in terms of player trading has to keep that in mind," Watkins went on. "It can't undercut what one of the primary loops of the game is, which is caring about exploring the world, finding the things you need to find, and then caring about getting those things out, rather than, you know, hoarding 3,000 Lance's Mixtapes to sell so you can then buy all your guns on the trading market."
</p>
<p>Watkins does feel that Embark can do a lot more with the current NPC trading system, which obviously allows the developers to maintain direct control over the game’s economy. And if auction houses are off the menu, it’s very possible Embark will expand the off-map side of the game by turning the secret human citadel of Speranza into an actual walkable hub area. 
</p>
<p>"For me, personally, I love the vibe and aesthetic of a walkable hub, but I would want to preserve the menuing so that you can do it quickly and efficiently, rather than [having to] run to Celeste and then run to my [raider's room], and then 'Oops, I forgot this thing at Shani’,” Watkins told PCGamesN. “But there's also, of course, an immersion factor to that. So yeah, it's something we have discussed, and we'll continue to discuss, and I think there's definitely a good appetite on the team for it as well. It's more about when the right moment to open that door is."</p><p>All this aside, Embark are looking at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raider-devs-want-future-expeditions-to-be-less-about-fat-stacks-and-fomo">creating more varied ARC Raiders expeditions in future</a>. I quite like the idea of a proper trading animation, though I do worry about the possibility of an accompanying sucker punch mechanic. Sike! Perhaps if they foster enough bonhomie at the level of the animations, players could host their own impromptu auctions out in the wilderness.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-Marathon Art Director Talks About The Game’s Evolution And Leaving Bungie]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-development-runner-art-2000661234</link>
            <guid>1410718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> is a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">hero extraction shooter</a>, but it wasn’t always that way. Former franchise art director Joseph Cross detailed his time working on the game in a new interview, including a big change to a core aspect of the game midway through development. He also spoke about <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">leaving Bungie</a> after spending so much time working <em>Destiny</em> and the company’s upcoming multiplayer game.</p> <p>“The game design itself [had] a pretty profound evolution midway through, and that changed the visual psychology a fair amount,” the veteran artist <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">told Mikhail Klimentov’s newsletter <em>ReaderGrev</em> in a new interview</a>. As Cross describes it, <em>Marathon</em>‘s player characters were originally just generic throwaway mercenaries that players would customize to fit their own fantasy. It was only later on that the development team made the shift to actual characters with prescribed backstories, abilities, and unique visual identities.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“You’re going from designing one vehicle in a fleet of a thousand to now you’re designing the Millennium Falcon,” he said. “The psychology changes. I think that gets back to your original question, which is like, art relating to gameplay and at what point do those collide? And that certainly was a big one. In the case of this production it was a fairly significant event, and had to happen incredibly quickly, too.”</p> <p>The hero aspect has become an important part of the marketing around <em>Marathon</em>‘s in-world fiction and a differentiator between it and genre rivals like<em> Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. But it also gives the game one foot in the realm of a genre that some players seem incredibly burnt out on. Elsewhere in the interview, Cross said the game is banking a lot on its striking art style, which borrows inspiration from things as wide-ranging as Nike sneaker culture and Ikea furniture assembly, to help set it apart.</p>

 <p>He said:</p> <blockquote><p>There’s also something about the design of the game, where at a certain point I really did believe that art had potentially more of a responsibility for creating interest than it would if we were working on a different kind of game. The game design, nobody’s reinventing the wheel here. We’re putting compelling spins on established mechanics. The narrative is also not reinventing the wheel. It’s an abandoned space colony where something mysterious happened. We’ve seen this a lot. It’s about how you spin it, and at some point, for better or for worse, I told myself that this is an opportunity for art to sort of step up and provide a level of newness to this world.</p></blockquote> <h2>Leaving Bungie on the eve of <em>Marathon</em>‘s release</h2> <p>So why did Cross, who spent over a decade working on art for the studio beginning with the original<em> Destiny</em>, decide to recently leave before <em>Marathon</em> ships? He said he’s an artist first and foremost, and is increasingly conscious of the limited number of new projects he’ll actually get to work on in his lifetime. “I’m not a founder of Bungie,” he told Klimentov. “This is not my company. And I’m conscious of the number of projects I get to work on in my life. I’m not getting any younger. I’ve spent what will ultimately be 15 years, essentially, on two projects for Bungie: <i>Destiny</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Marathon</i>, with film work in between.”</p>

 <p>Cross decided on his departure just a couple of weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em>‘s new March 5 release date</a> was decided. “The natural cadence of the kind of work that happens post-launch in a live service game, I also understood what that was looking like,” he added. “It’s also true that at the level of seniority that I had, there are challenges there that don’t necessarily exist as an artist, and getting to this phase of a project like this at that level had its own challenges that contributed also.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whether you’re a content creator who relies on great sound or just someone who needs to record audio or interviews, an excellent and affordable mic can be hard to find. DJI is here to save the content creation world again with another affordable product you won’t want to miss out on. You can snatch up the DJI Mic 3 for a discounted price right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">The DJI Mic 3 (2 TX + 1 RX + Charging Case) is up for grabs at Amazon for sale, where you can pick it up for $259</a>. That’s a savings of $70 and 21% less than the normal $329 price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mic that’s great for casual creators and established professionals</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 Bundle (2 Transmitters + Receiver + Charging Case) combines two wireless transmitters, a small wireless receiver and a charging case into a single lightweight portable recording package. DJI describes the system as ultra-light with adaptive gain control for maintaining a consistent volume level regardless of the type of speaker,. It also uses dual-band anti-interference technology to help prevent interference from nearby wireless devices.</p>
<p>DJi states that the combined battery life will provide up to 28 hours of continuous use when taking into account the charging case, allowing you to shoot for extended periods of time before having to charge the case again.</p>
<p>Two clip-on transmitters and a wireless receiver that mount to a camera hot shoe, can be used to create a complete 2 person wireless microphone system. All of these components fit inside the provided charging case that allows all of the components to remain organized and charged during non-use intervals.</p>



<p>The receiver can connect to as many as four wireless microphones and synchronize audio to as many as eight receivers, with four-channel output available for larger production needs. Therefore, you can begin with the two wireless microphones provided, and then purchase additional units to expand your recording capabilities.</p>
<p>Each of the two wireless microphones is capable of internally recording two separate files of 32 bit floating point data, providing a wider dynamic range than typical 24-bit systems, and therefore more opportunities for adjusting levels in post-production.</p>
<p>Additional details regarding power and connectivity include a charging case that not only powers the transmitters and the receiver but also stores all of the provided accessories. In terms of total operation time, DJI rates the system at 28 hours or more, depending on how often you are using each component before needing to recharge the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">If you’re ready to upgrade your mic situation or just want to add another to your arsenal, you can’t go wrong with this setup. Act quickly and get yours before it disappears from stock again.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video game studio sustainability is a tough nut to crack. Projects can have extremely high up-front costs—often funded by investors or publishers—and generate the bulk of their revenue in the short window after release. That means there are long periods where studios burn overhead while little money comes in. The problem is exacerbated if a publisher has a high revenue share or loans need to be paid back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balancing that equation is a key task as the game industry looks to recover from years of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done">mass layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-closes-the-initiative-and-cancels-its-perfect-dark-reboot">studio closures,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> especially for triple-A studios. IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak says there's one strategy that's helped the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> studio become stable: deliberately producing sequels with lower budgets than the original game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Abrak laid out this strategy in a late-November conversation with Game Developer while discussing IO Interactive's ongoing live support for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The studio drives interest (and revenue) through regular updates, including its celebrity-driven "Elusive Target" missions. But before it could enter that cycle, it had to produce the three Hitman games now united under the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> banner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do so, Abrak said the company deliberately produced 2018's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and 2021's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on lower budgets than than 2016 game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which cost about $70 million (Abrak previously disclosed these budget numbers on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemakersnotebook.libsyn.com/exploring-the-world-of-hitman-with-io-interactives-hakan-abrak">Game Makers Notebook podcast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "The investment in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">2016, the start of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a sizable investment," he explained, noting the company maintains its own bespoke game engine called Glacier. "But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which had a higher Metacritic [score] took half of the time and cost almost half of the budget" (around $40 million).He said the sequel was also a bigger commercial success, driving higher returns for IO Interactive.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/independent-game-festival-freeplay-warns-its-days-could-be-numbered" target="_self" data-discover="true">Independent game festival Freeplay warns its days could be numbered</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is in contrast to other triple-A projects at companies like Sony Interactive Entertainment, where sequels like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cost more than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-the-last-of-us-part-ii-i-and-i-horizon-forbidden-west-i-cost-200m-each-to-make">double their predecessors</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to produce despite existing gameplay and technological foundations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was then produced in just under two years, earned the highest Metacritic score of the three games, and cost $20 million, close to a quarter of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s budget. "That's the philosophy—the initial investment is very important and is risky, but how you build on the revolution of that, of making an exciting competitive product, instead of always thinking 'oh, I need to reinvent the revolution every time.'"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-assassin-s-creed-boss-sues-ubisoft-over-alleged-disguised-dismissal-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Assassin's Creed boss sues Ubisoft over alleged 'disguised dismissal'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="IO Interactive's sustainability journey had plenty of speed bumps">IO Interactive's sustainability journey had plenty of speed bumps</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IO Interactive "building on the revolution" of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> culminated in a choice not available to many developers—binding its three games into effectively one product, creating a kind of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron">Voltron</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game that benefits from regular updates. It's an innovative approach that's not necessarily available to all studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And while it's true that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cost less than their predecessor to develop, the studio faced other hurdles along the way. In 2017 former parent company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-puts-i-hitman-i-dev-io-interactive-up-for-sale">Square Enix divested</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from the studio and sold it back to company management. The studio </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-hitman-i-developer-io-interactive-makes-layoffs-to-secure-future">laid off several developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and scaled back the scope of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after losing key financial resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The transition from the Hitman trilogy to the new collected </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> collection also came with trial and error. When </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> debuted on PC exclusively on the Epic Games Store, IO Interactive wasn't initially prepared to let players who'd purchased </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Steam access promised content. A similar controversy rose up a year later when the game was released on Steam. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/01/03/hitman-3-becomes-hitman-world-of-assassination-includes-access-to-1-and-2">Bundling the three games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> product eventually cleared up these issues, ensuring all players received the same amount of content when purchasing the base game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-tweaks-and-clarifies-ai-disclosure-rules-for-steam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve tweaks and clarifies AI disclosure rules for Steam</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is all to say that even with a strong production plan, developers following in IO Interactive's footsteps should watch out for the rocks it's already stumbled on.
