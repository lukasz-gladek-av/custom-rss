		<p>Nintendo had another Direct stream for one of their early 2026 games, putting the weird and wonderful world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream</a>, which is now set to launch for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/Nintendo-Switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 16th April 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct – 29/01/2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNtYngxAs1k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The weird, waking dream cousin to the comparatively sensible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream gives you an island for you to populate with Mii characters and then act as their caretaker. There’s an element of The Sims where they will be able to wander around and find their own things to do and have their own desires, but it’s much less hands on.</p>
<p>It will start with creating your main character and other island residents, with the Mii character creator having been expanded for this game with new options such as face paint, eye-lights and more. You can also set each character’s dating preferences, and then determine some of their base personality. The intention is to create family and friends, but you can also fiddle with these options enough to create a teddy bear, for example.</p>
<p>With people on your island, they’ll sort of do their own thing, but you can prod and push them in a direction. Get two people to meet by picking one up and moving them nearby, and they’ll strike up conversation and probably friendship. &nbsp;They’ll also have desires, so you can hand them food when they’re hungry, give them new outfits and more. Over time, you can mould the characters by giving them quirks, like&nbsp;funny walks, floating, signature greetings, different eating styles, catchphrases.</p>

<p>But then they can have suggestions for people who should meet and give an introduction, or they might develop a crush, fall in love after a typically silly meet cute, and then get rejected. Or confess their love in a situation that you give helpful suggestions for – obviously do it when you’re on a romantic ferris wheel, right? – and suddenly rivals show up for the character to choose between! Drama!</p>
<p>If you get characters to live together, you’ll get to check in on their lives and see how they’re hanging out, their personalities clashing and vibing. Maybe they fight over the TV remote, help each other cooking, or have house meetings.</p>
<p>The island will come to have a bunch of shops for helping you customise, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supermarket</strong> – With daily rotating food, like escargot</li>
<li><strong>Clothes Shop</strong> – Featuring day-to-day clothing and sillier fancy dress</li>
<li><strong>News Station</strong> – The home of MiiNews with bizarre Mii character insert stories</li>
<li><strong>Renovation Centre</strong> – &nbsp;Choose room interiors such as modern minimalist, football stadium, or a fantasy forest</li>
<li><strong>Market Stall</strong> – Get great deals on items, or grab a mystery bag…</li>
<li><strong>Photo Studio</strong> – Pick your background and scene, choose the Miis to fill the spots and snap photos!</li>
<li><strong>Island Design Centre</strong> – Buy benches, flower pots, and much more to decorate your island. You can also expand the island and use this as a way to create a big metropolis, multiple joined land patches, and even giant portraits.</li>
<li><strong>Studio Workshop</strong> – Create pixel art patterns that can become item inserts for characters, from drawing a pet to latte art, TV backgrounds, clothes patterns, ground tiles, house exteriors and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade, and on everything we saw in this Direct, it could be pretty darned great!</p>

Along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">a release date</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo has confirm that players will be able to create non-binary Miis in the new game <em>and</em> that they'll be able to select dating preferences for their characters.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>, and in a game where customisation and creation is off-the-charts, more gender and relationship options should be a given. It <em>should've</em> been a given in 2013, but Nintendo is making up for it this time around.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067msyvwi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, when creating your Mii, you'll be able to select from three genders: Male, Female, and Non-binary. And you can also select your Mii's dating preferences, again between the three gender options. You can select one, more than one, or none of them. Essentially, you can date whoever you want — or no one at all.</p>

<p>This is a <em>huge</em> win for many fans of Tomodachi Life on the 3DS, which drew criticism back when it released in Japan in 2013. Initially, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/tomodachi_collection_new_life_features_same_sex_marriage_for_men_but_not_women">a bug appeared to allow same-sex relationships in-game</a>, which Nintendo later patched out. Nintendo followed up the patch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/04/nintendo_provides_some_context_to_2013s_tomodachi_life_same_sex_marriage_controversy">with some clarifications</a>, but fans were understandably still unhappy that the option to date whoever they wanted wasn't available.</p>
<p>This prompted the 'Miiquality' social media campaign ahead of the game's Western release, with Nintendo of America addressing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/tomodachi_collection_new_life_features_same_sex_marriage_for_men_but_not_women">the controversy shortly after</a>. Then, two days later, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/nintendo_apologises_for_disappointing_many_people_over_tomodachi_life_same_sex_marriage_issue">the company issued an apology</a>, stating "if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players."</p>
<p>And, given today's Nintendo Direct, it seems like the developers have stuck to their promise, which is fantastic to see. Now we can all spend time with Hugh Morris however we want, romantically or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although one, if not the <strong>most iconic sequence</strong> in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has already been recreated in<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, there are still a lot of beautiful moments left to recreate in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em>. One of these moments, which takes place near the end of the original, was one the series director was looking forward to recreating, and he believes the team did <strong>full justice to it.</strong></p>



<p>As reported in a recent <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">livestream</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vinesauce</strong></a> had the chance to participate in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a casual gathering </strong>which took place after a promotional event for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em></strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> </strong>with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in New York City earlier this month. Unsurprisingly, the<strong> third part of the remake trilogy</strong> was briefly mentioned when Hamaguchi-san revealed which <strong>part of the story yet to be remade he was more looking forward to.</strong></p>



<p>Through an interpreter, Hamaguchi-san said that the moment he was looking forward to recreating the most was <em>"Cloud finding himself with the help of Tifa,</em>" which is one of the <strong>most intense and emotional parts of the Final Fantasy VII story</strong>. While he did not discuss much about how the scene was recreated in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</em>, Hamaguchi-san stated that <em>"they nailed it,"</em> a strong statement that is sure to make every fan of the game quite excited about what is in store for the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>

<p>Besides seeing the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">emotional impact</strong> this particular moment will have with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">current-generation graphics</strong> and with the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> superb voice acting</strong> that Cody Christian and Britt Bratton already delivered for Cloud and Tifa in the first two entries in the series, it will be very interesting to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much the scene will have been changed</strong>, with Tifa's brief first venture in the Lifestream in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which doesn't happen in the original, and Cloud's already being partially aware of his past and the truth behind the Nibelheim incident. No matter what, I know I am really looking forward to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Gamers Are Not Actually Opposed to AI, But Rather People Exploitation and Slop”, Says Dev Behind AI-Powered Game Bobium Brawlers]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/</link>
            <guid>1419847</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Game developer <strong>Studio Atelico</strong> is announcing its AI-powered debut game, <strong>Bobium Brawlers</strong>, today. It's a turn-based card and dice creature battler game currently targeting mobile platforms (iOS to start, where it's set to launch later this year) with a specific twist: players can create the creatures that will be in their deck simply by describing them to the so-called Studio Atelico AI Engine. </p>



<p>Crucially, the AI engine will run on-device, ensuring privacy, low latency, and no additional costs. Because of this, Bobium Brawlers will only run on models equipped with relatively recent versions of the <strong>Neural Engine</strong>, probably from <strong>iPhone 13</strong> onward. Of course, the developers also created many decks and cards to train the engine to follow those examples when creating new cards.</p>



<p>In a remote presentation attended by Wccftech, Art Director <strong>Mollie Boorman</strong> explained that S<strong>tudio Atelico employs a team of human artists who have created extensive training assets</strong>. These images were paired with descriptions to train our model. She clarified that <strong>this game simply could not have been made without AI</strong>, as it allows players to create unique artwork in minutes. However, they are not using AI for everything.</p>



<p>Moreover, the studio paid artists to develop the visual style and to create the bulk of the non-creature art featured in Bobium Brawlers, and <strong>continues to pay them for the styles they created, including royalties for creatures generated in-game using their training assets</strong>. Their ethical approach was described as distinctly pro-artist, pro-player, and pro-human, <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/game-ai-art-without-losing-your-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in a blog post on their website a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>After the presentation, given the strong anti-AI stance of many hardcore gamers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as seen recently with the debacle surrounding <strong>Larian</strong> and their upcoming <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), it's no wonder that the very first question in the roundtable interview addressed the elephant in the room: is the studio ready to face backlash?</p>



<p>Studio Atelico CEO and co-founder <strong>Piero Molino</strong> explained that he sympathizes with the profound reasons behind this growing sentiment among gamers, but also clarified that he doesn't believe gamers are actually anti-AI; rather, they are opposed to "slop" and the exploitation of humans that is sometimes associated with it.</p>



<p><em>I understand that stance for two reasons. One, because of how most tech companies are adopting this technology without providing for the people who made it possible, which are, in the case of image generators, the artists whose images the generators have been trained on. It makes total sense why there is this kind of pushback; I totally understand that. We are approaching it from a different point of view: paying artists and giving them royalties on what is being generated. </em></p>



<p><em>We do not want to exploit anyone; we want to use that technology to create new mechanics that were not possible before. <strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and "slop." These are both things that we are trying very strongly to avoid</strong>. We are supporting the people who make it possible to create these models and we are not creating slop. We are trying to have a specific art style that is tailored to our specific game, thanks to the work our artists are doing. We hope to disentangle the general sentiment towards AI and show what is possible when you use it in a very positive way.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Later in the interview, Molino added that in the very first version of Bobium Brawlers, <strong>some parts of the AI Engine will run in the cloud, but only a very small amount</strong>, and the studio plans to move those on-device as well in the future. Because they are just small parts, the cost for Studio Atelico is very low: less than one cent per creature creation overall. Molino reckons bringing the cost of AI engines in games to zero or close to it is crucial for the technology to actually spread in more titles.</p>



<p>When it comes to the game mechanics, the duels will be quick 1v1 battles that blend card mechanics with dice-rolling action. Players will be able to use clever combos and tactical improvisation, rather than grinding or chasing the meta, to win matches.</p>



<p>The bigger question, though, is whether you agree with the studio's approach and the CEO's view on why gamers are so vehemently anti-AI. Let us know in the poll and comments below!</p>

            <guid>1419844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>DayZ</strong> creator <strong>Dean Hall</strong> and <strong>Rocketwerkz's</strong> PvE sci-fi survival game <strong>ICARUS</strong> makes its console debut next month, on <strong>February 26, 2026,</strong> publisher <strong>GRIP Studios</strong> has announced. This comes after it was revealed in October 2025 that the game would be making its way to consoles at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<p>The console version will include the base game and the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>, which includes eleven additional animals between three new cats, five new dogs and three new horses, each with their own levels, talent tree, and requirements to help them survive alongside you.</p>



<p>The game's arrival on console comes five years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-the-co-op-survival-game-from-dean-hall-just-got-delayed-to-november/">it first launched on PC back in 2021</a>. While the game didn't arrive in the best shape, in the last six years, Rocketwerkz has consistently updated and improved the game and has been rewarded with a dedicated player base.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ICARUS: Console Edition Launches 26.02.26 | Pre-order Bonus Revealed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GTFL29dXa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>With the New Frontiers expansion adding the alien region of <strong>Prometheus</strong>, players jumping into ICARUS for the first time will have <strong>128km2</strong> of ground to cover and conquer as they try to survive the hostile world around them.</p>



<p>When GRIP Studios announced ICARUS would be coming to consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/">Wccftech had the chance to speak to the game's creator, Dean Hall,</a> who confirmed a few bits of info worth remembering as we approach its console release date.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is no crossplay between PC and console players, nor is there crossplay between PS5 and Xbox Series X/S console players. If you want to play with your friends, you'll all have to be on one platform.</p>



<p>Of course, that could change with GRIP Studios continuing to work towards adding crossplay support, but there's no guarantee it'll happen. The same goes for a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> edition, something that GRIP Studios won't necessarily focus on until after the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S editions are out the door.</p>

<p>What's more, if you pre-order <em>Icarus </em>on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, you'll get access to the Pet Companions Pack DLC, which, as the name suggests, adds a number of adorable animals to pet and look after.</p><p>News of <em>Icarus</em>' console release date comes just a couple of weeks after Rocketwerkz and founder Dean Hall announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rack up almost a million sales for itself</a> during the most recent winter Steam Sale.</p><p>Hall also said that <em>Icarus </em>had managed to shift just shy of 250,000 "DLC units", although since the game has a number of smaller packs available in addition to its major expansion, that could just mean a whole bunch of what are effectively microtransaction purchases.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar, <em>Icarus </em>is a survival game created by Dean Hall, one of the key players behind zombie sandbox <em>DayZ</em>. It's a PvE-focused affair that sees you (and, optionally, your squad) heading down to a planet on which terraforming has gone wrong and trying to survive its dangers.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Icarus </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013354/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 26th.

              <p>A smattering of classic<em> Final Fantasy</em> games are now available to buy and play via Good Old Games. It’s the first time any games from Square Enix’s popular RPG franchise have been made available on GOG, and to celebrate, the newly added titles are currently on sale.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/four_iconic_final_fantasy_titles_are_here">GOG announced</a> that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/final_fantasy">four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games were now available on the PC gaming storefront</a>. If you were expecting the first four entries into the series to be the first ones to arrive on GOG, you’ll be in for a surprise when you look below to check out the list of FF games added today.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy III (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VIII – Remastered</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IX </em>– $8.40 ($21)</li> </ul> <p>GOG says these entries “represent different eras of the series” which might help explain the scattershot release. But I guess you gotta start somewhere? All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> RPGs on GOG are also part of the store’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Good Old Game preservation program</a>, ensuring they will work on modern PCs for years to come, even if Square Enix removes them from sale or doesn’t want to update them in the future, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-warcraft-1-2-classic-remaster-drm-preservation-1851711097">something that has happened before</a>.</p> <p>“Few video game series have shaped the medium quite like <em>Final Fantasy,”</em> said GOG in a news post on Thursday. “For decades, it has defined storytelling in games, pushed technical and artistic boundaries, and created worlds and characters that resonate far beyond the screen. Today, we’re proud to announce that four landmark entries in the franchise are coming to GOG!”</p>

 <p>All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are available now. I expect more will be added in the future. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-caught-using-ai-generated-artwork-2000663836">Now, go tell GOG to stop using gross AI art for banners</a>.</p>

Once meant to be humanity’s second home, it is now a hostile frontier of toxic skies, savage wildlife, and relentless storms. Every drop from orbit is a fight for survival. Build shelter, craft weapons, hunt for food, and seek your fortune in exotic matter.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Survive alone or with up to four players in this uncompromising player-versus-environment survival game from the creator of <em>DayZ</em>.</p><p>The “New Frontiers” expansion is included from the start, transforming <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> into a larger, deadlier but more rewarding survival experience. Discover new maps, missions, creatures, and rewards.</p><p><strong>A Planet That Fights Back</strong></p><p>Icarus resists your presence; poisoned air, lightning storms that tear apart structures, wildfires that spread unchecked, and predators that stalk in the shadows. It feels like the planet itself wants to drive you back into orbit.</p><ul><li>With New Frontiers added from the start, you can explore two 64 km2 maps of handcrafted terrain across forests, mountains, deserts, and caves.</li><li>Harvest every tree, rock, and creature.</li><li>Adapt to extreme weather and natural disasters.</li></ul><p><strong>“New Frontiers” Included</strong></p><p>The Prometheus region, once sealed off by the UDA, is now open. Terraforming failed here completely, leaving raw alien landscapes intact but warped. This expansion expands Icarus far beyond its original borders:</p><ul><li><strong>New Map and Biomes</strong> – Alien grasslands, volcanic wastelands of molten lava, and dangerous swamplands.</li><li><strong>Six Narrative Missions</strong> – A chained story across Prometheus as you pursue a mysterious whistleblower for the UDA.</li><li><strong>New <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Face Needlers, Dracs, Dreadwings, and other mutated apex predators, evolved to dominate these zones.</li><li><strong>New Exotics</strong> – Discover a volatile new exotic with unique effects on the flora, plus new exotic plants and over 30 additional workshop items.</li><li><strong>New Items and Resources</strong> – Mine obsidian, clay, scoria, crystallised miasma, and super-cooled ice; craft 100+ new items including weapons, food, recipes, and building tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Three Ways to Survive</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World</strong> – Establish permanent bases and explore freely.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Timed contracts where extraction is everything.</li><li><strong>Outposts</strong> – Low-pressure zones for creative building and experimentation.</li></ul><p><strong>Progression and Reward</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tech Tree and Talents</strong> – Advance from primitive tools to advanced tech.</li><li><strong>Specialization</strong> – Focus as a hunter, builder, or survivalist.</li><li><strong>Orbital Workshop</strong> – Trade exotic matter for permanent upgrades and equipment. Exotic matter remains the ultimate prize; rare, unstable, and deadly to pursue.</li></ul><p><strong>Solo or Cooperative Play</strong></p><p>Up to four players can share each drop, combining skills and resources to endure. Prefer to go it alone? Survive solo with a Solo Talent Tree for maximum challenge.</p><p>(Note: <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> does not support cross-play.)</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Console Edition</em> Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ICARUS: Console Edition Launches 26.02.26 | Pre-order Bonus Revealed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GTFL29dXa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/icarus-console-edition-launches-february-26]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/theres-a-fresh-demo-for-nioh-3-with-a-week-to-go-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1419796</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>WIth the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> next week on 6th February, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have released a new demo for the game, letting you explore early areas on both PS5 and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>The new demo will let players create their custom character and make a start on the game by exploring the Warring States period and battling through to the Jakotsu-baba boss, with save data able to carry over to the full game. This can all be played solo, of course, but there’s also support for up to three players in online multiplayer, so your buddies can come give you a hand.</p>


<p>Beating the demo by 15th February will then reward you with the Twin-Snake Helmet for the full version of the game – this bonus cannot be earned by those who’s already obtained it through the PS5 alpha demo, though.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 casts you as Tokugawa Takechiyo who has been forced from the shogunate throne by his rebellious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, and must face him and his army of demons in battle for the ages.</p>

<p>New for this game is a quick switch to a second combat style, transforming from Samurai to Ninja in a flash. You’ll make the most of these with the yokai that you battle in the new ‘open field’ setting that greatly broadens the level style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">hands on with Nioh 3 last year</a>, experiencing both this new combat style shifting and open field design. I said, “It’s undeniably fun to switch back and forth between Samurai and Ninja, or just stick with the faster, nippier Ninja in general. No doubt, this is one for fans of the series and the wider genre to pay attention to when it launches in February 2026.”</p>

            <p>After years worth of all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">the other thing</a>, they've just randomly decided now's the time to acknowledge it. Via a Tweeter reply containing that GTA: San Andreas meme no less. I may be a weathered old sailor with cannon fuses tied into my beard and more trips up the rigging than I can count to my name, but I didn't foresee this being how Ubisoft finally acknowledged that Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake.</p>

<p>That's what they've done, though. Years of silence, and then like a well-timed broadside, boom:</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Why now, in response to a seemingly random bloke selling an Edward Kenway-shaped plastic trinket on Vinted? Well, a man of the sea can only assume the publishers' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a>, which reportedly included the Black Flag remake being pushed back into the financial year ending March 2027, factor in.</p>
<p>Those have been quickly followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">redundancy plans</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">unions calling strike action</a> against Ubisoft, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-designer-claims-ubisoft-have-suspended-him-for-alleged-breach-of-the-duty-of-loyalty-over-new-rto-policy">real</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-just-as-if-it-never-existed-following-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-remake-cancellation-actor-discusses-losing-three-years-worth-of-work">toll</a> taken on folks lives rightly taking precedence over chatter about a pirate game.</p>
<p>Perhaps this just the way things have to go these days. The sobering reality of workers being chucked into the sun punching you right in face. Then, when you open your eyes again, the surreal sight of a corporate social media account finally tipping its cap to a long-rumoured remake's existence ages after it'd have made sense to do so is there. Immense and unforgiveable brutality, intercut with the promise of goods people might treasure conveyed in a manner so strange you can scarcely believe. Yo-ho. A pirate's life indeed, I guess.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-all-in-on-portable-power-station-clearance-river-2-pro-generator-drops-40-with-a-5-year-warranty-2000663939</link>
            <guid>1419784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Investing in a power station can be a smart decision if you’re often out and about or want to have a backup option during outages. The best options out there offer multiple ports and a reliable battery life, but they often don’t come cheap. That, however, is changing today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, you can snag the EF Ecoflow River 2 Pro portable power station for just $315 at Amazon, after the retailer knocked 40% off its usual $529 price tag.</a> The offer is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon. Grab yours now, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up (which can be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for a Wide Range of Devices</h2>
<p>The River 2 Pro weighs just 17.2 lbs and features a built-in handle, both of which make it easy to carry the power station around. You’re getting a total of 11 ports, including four AC outlets, one USB-C port, three USB-A ports, two DC outlets, and one car outlet. That’s more than enough to keep all your important devices powered in cases of emergency. Think plugging your smartphone, laptop, an electric blanket, a coffee machine, and lights – all at the same time, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>The output of up to 1600W makes the thing perfectly capable of running around 80% off all your appliances, even high-wattage ones. It can recharge your phone from 0 to 100% 57 times on a single charge, and your laptop for over 10. When at home, it keeps your electric blanket powered for 12 hours, your refrigerator for five, and even your PC for over an hour. That means you can rely on it to get work done during an unexpected outage, plus keep other essentials running for extended periods.</p>



<p>When it comes to recharging the power bank itself, that doesn’t take forever either. You can power it back up via an AC outlet, a solar panel, a Type-C cable, or your car. Using an AC outlet is the fastest option, juicing it back to 100% in just 70 minutes. A 220w solar panel will take around 3.5 hours, while plugging it into a 12v/24v 8A car outlet gets the job done in about nine hours. This flexibility comes in handy when you’re camping in the wild, traveling, or dealing with electricity supply issues at home. Additionally, the LFP battery cells are long-lasting, letting you recharge the River 2 Pro more than 3000 times before dropping to 80% capacity. For reference, that’s nearly 10 years of regular use. What’s more, the power station includes advanced BMS protection that monitors voltage, current, and temperature to ensure longevity. Basically, it’s made to support all your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Included in the box are the power station itself, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and a 5-year service for added peace of mind</a>. Altogether, the EcoFlow River 2 Pro portable power station is great for anyone looking to invest in a reliable power solution without putting a dent in their wallet. This deal makes the upgrade easier than ever. Just make sure you grab the offer before it’s too late.</p>

<p>The Split Fiction game director has revealed that he has received the first draft of the upcoming adaptation’s script. </p>



<p>The movie adaptation of Split Fiction was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-movie-confirmed-with-sydney-sweeney-taking-a-lead-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in April 2025</a>, less than 2 months after the game’s release. It has some big names attached to it, with Sydney Sweeney taking one of the lead roles and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick writing the script. </p>







<h2 id="h-split-fiction-director-has-met-sydney-sweeney">Split Fiction Director Has Met Sydney Sweeney  </h2>

The post features a video in which Josef Fares states that he has received the “first version of the script.” However, he added that he will believe it when he sees it, due to “so much talk in Hollywood”.

One of the writers specialises in fantasy stories and the other in sci-fi, and they have been hooked into a machine that steals their ideas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>When the Denver Broncos season ended in a gut wrenching 10-7 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Conference Championship Game last Sunday, fans took to social media to vent their frustration and mourn the end of a terrific season, a common occurrence in a league with so few dynasties. For a new group of fans, however, this was their first-ever playoff heartbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>New fans adopt sports teams all the time, be it participating in family or community bonding or connecting to a new team through outside media. Thanks to the internet, the latter phenomenon has become much more common, broadening fanbases globally instead of traditional localities from which they drew support.</p><p>This season, the Denver Broncos were in the center of a unique fan experience. Slowly, starting in September, videos of highlights from the team’s wins showed up on social media, overlaid with music from the anime <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, a show about girls with horse traits going to a specialized academy to learn how to compete in horse races. First, anime fans kept posting more and more edits, and more and more people started watching them. Then sports fans started getting in on the trend, adopting the styles similar to anime creators. Eventually, cosplayers who love the characters from the anime started going to Broncos games, hyping the trend up even more and cementing a new community of fans. Cosplayers in Denver routinely started going to games in character and meeting up with other cosplayers for professional photoshoots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://matsustudios.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>MatsuStudios</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>“I love meeting new people, but am painfully awkward. Cosplay breaks down the uncomfortable barriers and gives you an instant connection with someone,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greycloudscos/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Grey, a Denver-based cosplayer</u></a> and <em>Umamusume</em> fan, said about the trend.&nbsp;</p><p>For them, sports have always been a part of their life as an avid snowboarder, but watching professional teams had never been an interest. Their family is from Philadelphia, and diehard fans of the city’s sports teams. Yet, thanks to this blossoming community, they’re showing off Broncos colors in cosplay.</p><p>“Last week, I actually turned on a [Broncos] game voluntarily because of <em>Umamusume</em>.”</p><p><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em> was a Japanese game that released in 2021, as well as an anime series that ran from 2018 to 2023 with 39 episodes over three seasons. But interest in the series, especially globally, revived in June 2025 with the English release of the <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime/"><u>mobile game</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, TikTok user its.a.shyday started posting edits of <em>Umamusume</em> characters mashed up with his favorite NFL team, the Denver Broncos. These videos gained some traction online, but it wasn’t until a video posted on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@its.a.shyday/video/7556058282964684046?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-93QOKx0FBaJ&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>September 30th</u></a> that the edits started to take off and inspire others to join in.</p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@its.a.shyday/video/7556058282964684046" data-video-id="7556058282964684046" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@its.a.shyday" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@its.a.shyday?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@its.a.shyday</a> <p><a title="broncos" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/broncos?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#broncos</a> <a title="umas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/umas?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#umas</a> <a title="umamusumeprettyderby" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/umamusumeprettyderby?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#umamusumeprettyderby</a> <a title="umamusume" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/umamusume?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#umamusume</a> <a title="nfl" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nfl?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">#nfl</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - its.a.shyday" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7556058369199573774?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">♬ original sound - its.a.shyday</a> </section> </blockquote> </figure><p>At the time the Broncos were 2-2 and it was unclear how their season would go. Following that win, the Broncos proceeded to go 12-1 the rest of the regular season and make the AFC Championship Game, one game away from the Super Bowl.</p><p>“Why the Denver Broncos? Well... their mascot is a horse, which fits perfectly with the whole <em>Umamusume</em> vibe,” Shy said in an interview about his process. “It just felt natural to combine the two, and I think people have really enjoyed seeing it.”</p><p>Having first watched the anime in 2018, Shy said he first noticed a few other small accounts creating similar edits and realized there was a potential fanbase crossover. When the edits first started taking off his TikTok account had only around 200 followers, which has since ballooned to just under 10,000. He says that he thinks “at least 100” people have started watching the anime because of his edits.</p><p>“I hope it follows us into next season. I can’t wait,” he said.</p><p>Many NFL <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/arts/television/anime-sports-athletes-pokemon-naruto-dragon-ball.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>players are anime fans</u></a> and have embraced their inner otaku, bringing imagery from popular series and mangas to press conferences and on their gear. Teams like the Seattle Seahawks and <a href="https://www.chron.com/culture/article/texans-social-media-anime-21286614.php?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Houston Texans</u></a> have embraced anime fandom on their social media. The Los Angeles Rams <a href="https://www.therams.com/news/rams-one-piece-game-day-collaboration-sunday-december-3?ref=aftermath.site"><u>even did a gameday collaboration</u></a> with the anime <em>One Piece</em> in 2023.</p><p>With the advent of streaming services, more and more people in the United States are being exposed to anime, leading to a massive upheaval in what a stereotypical anime fan is like, said Sandra Annett, an Associate Professor in Film Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University.</p><p>“Anime and sports fandoms don't generally cross over, since anime is associated with ‘geeks’ and sports are associated with ‘jocks,’ to use the old high school categories,” she said. That being said, Arnett added that “this perception has been changing since 2020,” as more and more western media has embraced animated shows for all ages.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/neon-gensis-evangelion-lehigh-valley-phantoms-phancon/"><div><p>A Hockey Team Recreated The Evangelion Intro For A Stadium Full Of Fans</p><p>Here’s how an American Hockey League team embraced anime—then went viral.</p><p><span>Nicole Carpenter</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Arnett said that another wrinkle that makes this crossover unique is how anime in Japan tends to be targeted towards a more conservative gender role, meaning that a show about horse girls racing may not have the same audience as a sports anime aimed at male viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the United States, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/02/05/taylor-swift-nfl-fans/78050737007/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>nearly half of NFL viewers </u></a>are female, and the league claims that almost 70% of women and girls in the country are fans of the NFL.

<p>Punch up, super star!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After being announced for Switch 2 way back in May 2025, SEGA has today revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</a> will mark the series' long-awaited debut on a Nintendo system on <strong>26th March</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who have missed the details up to this point, this Switch 2 release features full cross-play, so you can battle it out with pals on other consoles as well as rollback netcode support, balance updates, training tweaks, <em>and</em> new moves and combos to slip into your fighting style.</p>
<p>It serves as a pretty beefy upgrade to the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_5">original 2007 game</a>, with the drastically improved visuals showing just how far we've come in the last... 20 years *<em>gulp</em>* R.E.V.O. launched on PS5, Steam and Xbox Platforms back in October 2025, where it went on to pick up some pretty strong reviews — it currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage/">Metascore</a> of 78 based on 15 critic reviews.</p>
<p>If this all sounds very much up your street, the game's Open Beta Test kicks off on 18th February, designed to test "network servers and cross-play performance for the game with the other available platforms," says SEGA. You'll need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to get involved, obviously, but it'll be a good chance to see what the game's all about.</p>

<p>If you're already certain that you're going pick it up, however, then you'll be pleased to hear that pre-orders open <em>today</em>! You can pick up the standard digital edition for <strong>$19.99</strong>, or the digital 30th Anniversary Edition for <strong>$49.99</strong>, which includes all kinds of bonuses like the Legendary and Yakuza DLC packs, the swimsuit costume set, pre-production artwork and more. As with the majority of Sega's Switch 2 output, the physical version is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release"><strong>Game-Key Card</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A physical release of the 30th Anniversary Edition is also available for <strong>$49.99</strong>, including all of the gubbins outlined above <em>and</em> with a double-sided poster to boot.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/</link>
            <guid>1419739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/press-release-webcast">published its latest financial report</a> for the company's second quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, and while the overall company revenue increased by <strong>17%</strong> to a whopping <strong>$81.3 billion</strong>, that increase was driven by its cloud and AI services. Its games division, however, saw a <strong>9% overall drop</strong> compared to last year, bringing in <strong>$623 million</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>The biggest drop on the Xbox side came from its hardware, which saw a <strong>32% drop in revenue</strong> compared to last year. This marks the second straight quarter where hardware revenue specifically has dropped to such a degree, after its first quarter report listed a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenues-see-113-million-decline-amid-hardware-sales-drop-and-limited-gaming-content-and-services-growth/">29% drop in hardware revenue</a></strong>.</p>



<p>It's altogether a sizable, but unsurprising dip, considering the fact that the <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> consoles <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-did-so-badly-on-us-black-friday-sales-it-was-beaten-by-a-console-youve-never-heard-of">sold less than a non-big three, family and kid-dedicated console called the <strong>Nex Playground</strong></a> over Black Friday. It's also not a surprise when you remember that Microsoft raised the price on the Series X/S consoles multiple times last year.</p>



<p>Once with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">global price increase that hit the <strong>United States</strong> the hardest</a>, and then again four months later with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">a price increase that only affected the United States</a>. Pricing your customers out of wanting to buy your console is one way to sell less hardware, and that's before we even get to the other major factor here: you don't need an Xbox to play Xbox games.</p>



<p>Speaking of those games, despite first-party Xbox titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"><strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> selling like hotcakes when it arrived on <strong>PlayStation</strong></a>, revenue from Xbox content and services, which includes its <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>subscription, was also down compared to last year, with a <strong>5% drop in revenue</strong>. A step back from its first quarter results, which did record a revenue increase, albeit by only 1%. </p>



<p>That said, the drop is a particularly damning stat when you consider that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/"><strong>major price spike</strong> that Game Pass saw last year</a> was meant to ultimately drive more revenue from the service, even if it wasn't growing in users. Now, while we can't say for certain that Game Pass users have also taken a dive, since Microsoft hasn't presented those figures, but to see services and software drop after last quarter does add fuel to the arguments that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/">Microsoft has <strong>lost the trust of players</strong></a>, and that last year's price spikes on hardware and services <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">had a negative impact at the time</a>, and could have a lasting impact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/">ultimately drives users further away from the platform</a>.   </p>



<p>In an attempt to be optimistic about the overall drop in revenue in its gaming division, Microsoft chief executive officer <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> told investors, "<em>In gaming, we are committed to delivering great games across Xbox, PC, cloud, and every other device. And we saw record PC players, and paid streaming hours on Xbox</em>."</p>



<p>Later in the call with investors, chief financial officer <strong>Amy Hood</strong> said the company expects "<em>revenue to decline in the mid-single digits</em>" compared to the previous year, though she says that's only due to last year benefiting "<em>from strong content performance, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass</em>." Meanwhile, hardware revenue is expected to continue falling.</p>

<p>Of course, <em>Phasmophobia </em>also has plenty of events planned throughout 2026, including a brand new one-time event and the return of old favorites like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="043f6095-0d10-420d-8bec-e56dd003d4b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Cursed Hollow</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3faae98-97a0-41cc-b045-74499b5ceb42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-winters-jest-event-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dff99f7f-c6cc-4e9a-976a-8a699b4b7222" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Winter's Jest</a>.</p><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>director Daniel Knight says he's hoping that the 1.0 release of <em>Phasmophobia</em>, which still doesn't have a date attached to it, will "feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020".

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has emerged from the giant Easter egg in which he makes games to “debunk a few myths and false assumptions” about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, his forthcoming sticky-fingered life sim. The good news is that he’s been “very productive” lately, though he admits that he “shouldn’t have announced the game so early”, which suggests we’ve a ways to go yet before the first proper Haunted Chocolatier trailer or info blowout.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Myth and/or false assumption number one is that Barone will ultimately abandon Haunted Chocolatier and turn the game into a chunky update for Stardew Valley - much like a patisserie chef tipping the scorched remains of a failed crème brûlée all over an award-winning dark forest gateau.
</p>
<p>
“First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier,” Barone retorts in <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">a new blog post</a>. “But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley and Haunted Chocolatier are separate games. It doesn’t even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same ‘engine’ as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley.”
</p>
<p>
(Full clarification in the interests of public health and culinary decency: you can’t reuse spoiled crème brûlée as a dark forest gateau topping either. You will only injure your digestive system and bring shame upon your family.)
</p>
<p>
The second myth Barone wishes to rebut is that Stardew Valley updates are sneaky testing grounds for Haunted Chocolatier features. “When working on Stardew Valley, I’m not thinking about Haunted Chocolatier, and vice versa,” he clarifies. “I wouldn’t ‘test something out’ in Stardew Valley because that would be unfair to Stardew Valley, and also I don’t want to spoil ideas for Haunted Chocolatier by adding them first to Stardew Valley. Also, Stardew Valley is a different game, so you can’t really ‘test something’ for Haunted Chocolatier in it in an accurate way.”
</p><p>
Myth No. 3 is that Barone is making another Stardew Valley update because he’s “burnt out on Haunted Chocolatier”. Nay, sirrah, you do but jest! Rest assured that Barone is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/concernedape-assures-that-stardew-valley-update-17-wont-delay-haunted-chocolatier-much-it-might-even-release-first">making another Stardew Valley update</a> simply because “it’s a very popular game with a large, ever-growing playerbase, and I still have additional ideas for how to improve it.” 
</p>
<p>
Also, he didn’t say it’s not coming out until 2030, whatever you may have read on some other lousy videogame website operated by FOOLS. “I was asked in 2025 if it would come out within the next five years, and I said ‘I hope so’,” Barone writes in closing. “This is very different than saying ‘it’s coming out in 2030’. The bottom line is, I don’t want to give a release date. The game will come out when it’s done.”
</p>
<p>
I hope you’ve all learned a valuable lesson here about rumour and speculation. Remember that videogames, much like crème brûlées, benefit from extended time in the oven and, dare I say, a degree of emotional detachment. I’m trying to figure out the videogame equivalent for blowtorching the crust. Day-one hotfixing, I guess?

              <p>Working out with your favorite tunes in the background can really give you that boost of energy you need to get moving. If you’re tired of your current buds or over-ear headphones falling off when things get a bit intense, you need an open-ear option that’s designed specifically for workouts.</p>

<h2>Secure Fit</h2>
<p>Open-ear bone conduction headphones feature a wraparound headband and sit outside the ear canal. These rest on your cheekbones just in front of the ears, and transmit sound through vibration to your inner ear directly. Your ear canal stays open to keep you aware of your surroundings, while the lightweight frame makes it easy to have the headphones on for longer periods.</p>
<p>The OpenMove headphones offer a secure fit with the wraparound titanium frame. Whether you’re taking a walk around the town or just running some early morning errands, these stay in place. They’re also ultralight at just 29g, which ensures all-day comfort. As for the performance, Shokz has packed OpenMove with a patented 7th-generation bone conduction technology that pushes deep dynamic stereo sound for all your favorite tracks. Everything from LoFi music to energy-packed songs and even podcasts comes through clearly.</p>



<p>There are dual noise-cancelling microphones that eliminate external noise while isolating yours. The result? Clear phone and video calls, even when you’re in a packed subway or a busy cafe. You won’t have to constantly repeat yourself or apologize for the background noise. Additionally, the open design keeps you aware of what’s happening around without having to take the headphones off completely.</p>
<p>Sweaty workout sessions or light rain won’t be a problem either, thanks to OpenMove’s IP55 rating. Battery-wise, a single charge offers up to 6 hours of continuous listening. It’s not massive, but it’s still enough to support you through daily workouts, runs, and walks. Recharging is made easy with the included USB-C cable, which juices them back up in no time.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to treat yourself to open-ear headphones that not just offer a stable fit but also deliver powerful sound, the Shokz OpenMove sport headphones are an excellent option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6941/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 for these, but you can pick one today for just $50.</a> Again, the offer won’t be around forever. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147</link>
            <guid>1419721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Since the wacky life sim series kicked off in 2009, Nintendo’s </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span> has been like a big, beloved dollhouse where players watch their Miis get into the weirdest relationships possible. There’s just been one caveat: until today, Miis have never been allowed to be gay.</span></p> <p><span>Just seconds into Thursday’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg"><i><span>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </span></i><span>Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo confirmed that players will finally be able to make their Miis queer through a surprisingly inclusive settings menu that occurs during the usual Mii creation process. Players can pick each Mii’s “dating preferences,” allowing them to date and marry multiple genders (or none at all).</span></p>

 <p><span>Possibly more impressively was the game’s use of the word “nonbinary” as a third gender option, which comes as a surprise for fans—in recent Nintendo games like </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>, the developer has evaded the topic by including two ambiguous options called “styles” that are still tied to traditional perceptions of gender. Adding the term, and an entire third gender option, is a </span><i><span>massive </span></i><span>step forward for the developer.</span></p> <p><span>In 2014’s </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span>, Miis were forced to be heterosexual and be solely male or female, so queer players resorted to using various mods. Another common workaround for the marriage issue, and my personal favorite, was setting one Mii up as the other gender and just ignoring the game’s pronouns (and annoying little comments on them disliking any gendered clothes they wore).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664149">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo’s decision to leave gay marriage out of </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life</span></i><span>, the first game in the series to be released outside of Japan, drew quite a bit of criticism. In 2014, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fighting-for-gay-marriage-in-a-nintendo-game-1572026032"><span>fans petitioned for Nintendo to add gay marriage</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-responds-terribly-to-gay-marriage-petition-1572973952"><span>Nintendo responded pretty harshly</span></a><span>. At one point, there was even </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rumor-nintendo-ending-gay-marriage-bug-in-popular-game-504266729"><span>a rumored bug</span></a><span> that allowed gay marriage, and a strange translation of some Japanese patch notes made fans believe Nintendo had cruelly patched it out.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Just a few days after its first statement, however, Nintendo circled back with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-apologizes-for-not-putting-gay-marriage-in-tom-1574185262"><span>a slightly more empathetic promise</span></a><span>: “We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Players have anticipated the addition of gay marriage to the game since then, so it wasn’t exactly a surprise. Still, after nearly 12 years of anticipation, it’s just a huge relief that we got some confirmation today (with the added bonus of a nonbinary option, which nobody seemed to expect). I’m not the only person who’s relieved after today’s announcement—the livestream’s comments were flooded with gay flag emojis, and a quick glance in the game’s Subreddit makes it pretty clear that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tomodachilife/comments/1qq9fnw/we_wonnnnnn/"><span>everyone else is delighted</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>I personally cannot </span><i><span>wait </span></i><span>to have a more diverse island, and I’m honestly thrilled to make my poor little Miis get into some even messier relationships when </span><i><span>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</span></i><span> releases on April 16.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Esports Nations Cup Reveals Insane $45 Million Commitment to Competitors]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esports-nations-cup-insane-45-million-commitment/</link>
            <guid>1419715</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has today unveiled a monumental $45 million commitment to the players, teams, and organizations participating in the upcoming Esports Nations Cup. The event is set to unravel in Riyadh in November, and it’s in addition to the staggering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2026-prize-pool-75-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$75 million Esports World Cup</a>, which begins in July.</p>



<p>While the Esports World Cup is centered around traditional organizations fielding teams across multiple games, the Esports Nations Cup is a country-based competition circuit that encourages national pride, amongst other things.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-ewcf-has-pledged-120-million-to-esports">The EWCF Has Pledged $120 Million to Esports</h2>



<p>The headline here is that the Esports World Cup Foundation, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has pledged an eye-watering $120 million to the esports space this year alone.</p>



<p>From November 2 to November 29, a host of countries will send their squads to Riyadh to compete across a slew of games, fighting for prize pools, recognition, and geographical bragging rights. In a press release, the $45 million pledge was broken down accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>$20 million in prize money, spread across 16 titles</li>



<li>$5 million in Club incentives for clubs that release and enable their professional players to participate in the ENC</li>



<li>$20 million through the ENC Development Fund, supporting partners with logistics, travel, marketing, and growth</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s hard to see a downside to this venture, as $20 million being set aside to help organizations get to this global stage is admirable, if nothing else.</p>



<p>In the release, the CEO of the EWCF, Ralf Reichert, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>National teams bring a powerful new layer to esports, one that is accessible, intuitive, and rooted in identity and pride. Clubs are the cultural backbone of esports. Nation-based competition expands the stage, creates new rivalries, and gives more fans a reason to care from day one. </p>



<p>Our prize model is designed to keep competition fair and sustainable, rewarding performance while supporting the long-term development of players, Clubs, and national programs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thus far, the EWCF has announced only a few titles out of the 16 coming to the Esports Nations Cup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>



<li>Trackmania</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>
</ul>



<p>More games will be announced in the coming days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty’s iconic map has made its way into Hytale thanks to the hardworking modders. </p>



<p>Hytale is still in early access; however, modders have been hard at work to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Over the past few days, we have seen the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-minecraft-crossplay-mod-has-been-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft crossplay</a>, and more make it to the title. Now, Activision’s iconic FPS franchise has joined the fray as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-now-has-call-of-duty-s-hijacked-and-cod-like-zombies-mod">Hytale Now Has Call of Duty’s Hijacked and Cod-Like Zombies Mod</h2>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/hytale-modders-have-recreated-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>, Call of Duty mods have now been integrated into Hytale. One modder has successfully added maps, including Hijacked from Black Ops 2, among others. Additionally, this mod transforms Hytale into a genuine first-person shooter, allowing players to engage in intense deathmatches with bullets flying from every direction. It also tracks kills and deaths, making the experience as close to a traditional first-person shooter as possible.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, there is a <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/cod-like-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">COD-like Zombies</a> mod that will add “a simple, configurable Zombies’ waves game mode.” The mod will feature round-based waves, automatic round progression, intermission delay &amp; chat announcements, configurable spawn points, proximity-based zombie spawning, and multiple zombie variants. Which other game do you want to see modded in Hytale next? </p>
