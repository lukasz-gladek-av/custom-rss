			<p>Have you ever wondered what would happen if Super Smash Bros. was made into a roguelite? How would the chaotic arena battling of Nintendo’s finest platform brawler work within the rinse and repeat loop of Indie developer’s favourite genre? Those seem to be the questions Gentle Giant Games asked themselves. Their answer? Spiritfall.</p>
<p><iframe title="Spiritfall Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rSJdbb7kHrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With a bold Saturday-morning cartoon aesthetic, Spiritfall instantly charms the eyeballs. You play as a little dead dude with a flaming head who must battle and defeat a whole bunch of creatures and bosses to free the realm from bad stuff. Or something. Look, I have to admit, the plot held my attention for about as long as a TikTok video. It’s generic and hardly compelling, but thankfully it doesn’t get in the way and can mostly be ignored whilst you crack on with all the beat ‘em up fun.&nbsp;And what stupendously enjoyable gameplay it is!</p>


<p>From a map screen, you’ll choose which arena you want to enter next, mostly by appraising which of the many exciting rewards on offer will help you to complete your run. With that decision made, you’re straight into the action. Played from a 2D perspective, combat is fast, frantic, responsive and oh-so-silky smooth. Enemies will spawn and you get to hitting them with an abundance of style, as if Devil May Cry’s Dante went 2D. The more you hit your foes, the higher your combo meter builds and the more your victims bounce around the arena, obliterating themselves against walls, plunging off the edge of the level, or – even better – taking out a few of their evil chums in a satisfying chain reaction of explosions. Just like Super Smash Bros. it’s all about controlling the space, using your directional attacks and charged specials to send enemies flying before they can surround and overwhelm you.</p>


<p>Enemy types are wide and varied, each working with the other in interesting variations of attack pattens to try and catch you out. You thankfully have a very effective dash that will help you reposition to strike from safety, perhaps from a platform above or below, or with an arena wall to your back. The enemy hordes are constantly probing for a weakness in your strategy, leading to demanding dynamic combat encounters that keeps your fingers clicking and your eyes from never blinking. Frankly, it’s ridiculously addictive and kept me coming back for more as the hours rolled by.</p>
<p>This being a roguelite, there’s a conglomeration of power-ups that you get to keep for the run, and a whole bunch of collectibles you can gather to unlock permanent upgrades in the central hub. Spiritfall is delightfully generous in the rapid pace of the progress the player makes, as you are always rewarded with something by the spirits you meet. From damage-dealing dashes, the ability to shoot lightning bolts, or to set fire to the many minions you face, the configuration of character builds is bewildering in its vastness. Overall, the difficulty is configured just right for that one-more-run buzz, with upgrades coming thick and fast, ensuring you make enough progress each time to feel compelled to try again, rather than dispirited and put off by the reset back to the start.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>, there’s an entire armoury of weapons to unlock, each one encouraging a different playstyle and approach. There’s something for everyone, from a straightforward hammer, to a quartet of rapid-punching fists, a bow with long distance attacks or a very complicated chain scythe thingy. I’m sure in the hands of someone more skilled that latter would be deadly, however, in my clumsy hands things got very messy, so I went back to the safe embrace of the hammer instead.</p>
<p>Whilst the gameplay is thrilling and eminently addictive, the characters you meet are bland and empty merchants. Unlike the best examples of this form, there are no intriguing relationships to build here, everyone you come across has just a few limited text boxes to offer by way of characterisation, but little else. Thankfully the combat, pace, and deliriously compelling roguelite loop more than make up for this, resulting in a game that is perfect for the Switch and for facing another train delay with a smile on your face. After all, the lack of a train driver means there is time for another run after all.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-revealed.1183119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Nihon Falcom and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>release date, with the JRPG remake getting a worldwide release later this year.</p>

<p>Back in December, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that the game would be getting a simultaneous global launch sometime in 2025, and now, thanks to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, we know the date: it's coming on September 19th.</p>

<p>As previously revealed, the game will be getting a release on PC and PlayStation 5 as well as Nintendo Switch. It'll be available in two different editions: the standard version and the Bracer Box edition, although we don't yet know what comes as part of the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=7Pcdz7o4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=RKVN5pmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>launches in September.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, it's a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, which is itself part of the wider&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>series (which has been running for much longer than you'd imagine).</p>

<p>The game will tell the same story as the original; it'll follow the adventures of Estelle and Joshua Bright, two "bracers" (think problem-solving bounty-hunter types) who are quickly drawn into a "conspiracy that threatens the very heart of their homeland", according to Falcom.</p>

<p>Since it's a remake, though, you can look forward to improved visuals across the board, plus "refined gameplay" that will allow you to choose between turn-based combat and real-time fighting.</p>

<p>You can also expect new voiceovers in English and Japanese, and, of course, you'll have the option of choosing which one of the two you want, so you don't have to suffer through the English dub if you don't want to. I'm sure it's perfectly fine, but I'll be picking Japanese. Sorry.</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013078" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p>We just had to write this one up, because it’s not every day that you find out there’s going to be a new game for the Mega Drive – or Genesis if you’re of the American persuasion. Yes folks, someone has decided that releasing games on modern consoles is too passé, too easy, and instead decided that they’d bring a new title to a console that’s been dead and buried for nearly three decades. That game? Earthion, an old-school scrolling shoot ’em up, which will release on physical cartridge for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, alongside PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earthion Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PP59afi7FD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Even more exciting than a new cartridge, is the fact that it also boasts a 27-track soundtrack from legendary composer Yuzo Koshiro, whose previous works include Streets of Rage, ActRaiser and The Revenge of Shinobi. So, not only is it going to look like the 90s and come on a 90s cartridge, it’s going to sound like the 90s as well.</p>
<p>Earthion has been created by Japanese dev team Ancient Corporation – owned, in fact by Yuzo Koshiro – and it’s a space-themed 2D side scrolling shooter that sees you taking control of ace pilot Azusa Takahashi through 8 levels of space mayhem, each with unique environments, enemies and huge, screen-filling bosses.</p>


<p>This being a modern retro title, players will be able to configure scanlines and emulate CRT TVs when playing on modern platforms. Mega Drive players should be just fine without. There will also be mutiple difficulty levels, a challenge mode, a level password system and online leaderboards, though here the Mega Drive meets its match, and you’ll just have to get your friends round to compete against like in the good old days.</p>
<p>Earthion is due to arrive later this year for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. You can wishlist it now on Steam!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that Hazelight's co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, and the studio has also provided updates on when we can expect the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>games to arrive.</p>

<p>As part of its 2024-25 earnings report, EA reveals that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has sold "nearly four million units" since launching in March, although developer Hazelight <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> it had passed that mark.</p>

<p>This figure means&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has racked up another two million sales for itself since the beginning of March; the game reached the two million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">inside a single week</a>, having already reached a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">within its first 48 hours</a>.</p>

<p>As well as a sales update for&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, EA also revealed when we can apparently expect new&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>games to arrive; both are due to land in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which means EA has until March 2026 to release them.</p>

<p>EA has already been drip-feeding information about the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>via its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>, whereby it continuously requests community feedback in order to shape and inform the development of the game.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, EA originally announced it was coming to Early Access in 2025 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">last year</a>, although when it does, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't be launching with any kind of offline mode</a>, unfortunately. You'll have to look to Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> if you want offline skating sims.</p>

Based on a real killer of the same name, Kempler would describe killing his grandmother just to know what it was like to kill someone with the type of methodical tone usually reserved for explaining a casserole recipe. Joe also had chillingly pragmatic reasonings for his murders, but he’s lost his cool on a number of occasions, showing the vulnerable humanity submerged under his psychosis. Kempler came across less as a sane human and more of a body that only exists to fulfill its murderous desires.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-recommend-id="image://99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Erzsebet Báthory looking devilish" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Erzsebet Báthory looking devilish" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-recommend-id="image://99ddfcf1dc8e403f43c9e756bad74055" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Erzsebet Báthory looking devilish" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t really a fair fight.

Joe is perpetuating incel behavior and toxic masculinity masked as love at a murderous level. Erzsbet is channeling ancient dark energy, usually from the blood of towns she’s had massacred, with the intent on bringing the apocalypse. She once burned a priest in front of his congregation just to prove she was more powerful than the god they prayed to. That’s evil on a biblical scale. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90db7f5384a27d17dafdbc55b354fb75" data-recommend-id="image://90db7f5384a27d17dafdbc55b354fb75" data-format="webp" data-width="1000" data-height="563" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pablo Escobar looking menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pablo Escobar looking menacingly " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90db7f5384a27d17dafdbc55b354fb75" data-recommend-id="image://90db7f5384a27d17dafdbc55b354fb75" data-format="webp" data-width="1000" data-height="563" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pablo Escobar looking menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re talking about Pablo Escobar the man or Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) the character in <em>Narcos, </em>he’s a maniac who would do anything to feed his power addiction. I wouldn’t say one life is more valuable than another, but the deaths of certain people do come with different consequences than the death of others. So, when Pablo had the depraved confidence to assassinate politicians knowing the governmental battle that would follow, it showcased a thirst for control that was dangerously blinding. If we’re talking evil, I would say flooding the home country you claim to love with a deadly drug, and even deadlier foot soldiers enforcing your rules to protect that drug empire is pretty evil. Joe’s killings were one at a time. Pablo bombed an entire flight that killed over 100 people, including children, without blinking an eye.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-recommend-id="image://0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-format="jpg" data-width="1486" data-height="991" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vecna ready to attack" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vecna ready to attack" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-recommend-id="image://0324c4985d922bdbd47df8e6e6845493" data-format="jpg" data-width="1486" data-height="991" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vecna ready to attack" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Similar to <em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em>’s Erzsebet Báthory, Joe is no match for a telepathic, otherworldly demon that can kill you without touching you. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-vecna-secrets-netflix-game-vr-1849752681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-vecna-secrets-netflix-game-vr-1849752681"><em>Stranger Things</em></a></span><em> </em>baddie Vecna’s (Jamie Campbell Bower) killings were disturbing because of how inhumane they looked.

In the series centered on a gruesome winner-take-all competition between destitute and desperate people, The Front Man monitored and orchestrated every nuance like a sadistic god entertained by the torture of his subjects. He shot his own brother in cold blood after the man uncovered the truth, choosing loyalty to a murderous system over family.  This sicko loved the thrill of murder so much he disguised himself as a contestant in his twisted game only to shoot the same contestants he endeared himself to. Joe romanticized his killings almost as narrative tropes in a trashy romance novel, a perspective that led to further delusions. The Front Man saw human life as expendable as that of a video game character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8d19bbf53bf3c37524d5639e37eed69f" data-recommend-id="image://8d19bbf53bf3c37524d5639e37eed69f" data-format="jpg" data-width="873" data-height="634" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frank Underwood holding court" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frank Underwood holding court" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d19bbf53bf3c37524d5639e37eed69f" data-recommend-id="image://8d19bbf53bf3c37524d5639e37eed69f" data-format="jpg" data-width="873" data-height="634" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frank Underwood holding court" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Netflix’s early dominance was built on Frank Underwood’s (Kevin Spacey) blood-soaked hands that were probably just getting done with strangling a journalist. Joe Goldberg was a sadistic serial killer, stalker, and terrible erotica writer, but at least he didn’t have the governmental power to gut Social Security funds for millions or almost started a war with Russia to improve his public approval. Frank would probably be jealous of Joe trapping people in a soundproof cage, but what made Frank crazier than Joe was his willingness to treat millions of lives with reckless abandon and emotional indifference. Joe was a serial killer who confused obsession with love. Frank was a monster who knew the difference and relished in every death he caused. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that's now available for download for free introduces a highly requested feature that is only available in a limited capacity in the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Dresscode mod developed by YIIS, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1062?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a system that lets users change character outfits and weapons in-game dynamically. The tool not only supports all the base game outfits, requiring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1071">another mod</a> to unlock those not normally available via the changing booth, but also modded outfits, of which quite a few are available online. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="FF7R Dresscode Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbOMnUSq_UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth modding scene is not as big as that of other titles, plenty of great mods have been developed since the game's PC launch early this year. While the first few mods were, unsurprisingly, on the simple side, the unofficial additions made to the second entry in the remake trilogy have gradually become better and better, and have gone as far as adding completely new <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters</a>, such as the Turks Rude and Reno.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games released this generation by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

Sadly, though, we’re going to have to wait until May 26, 2026, to actually play Lucia and Jason’s story. So, in the meantime, why don’t we think about all of the Rockstar games we’ve already enjoyed over the years and rank them for fun?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has developed and released over 30 games since its creation in 1998, and is responsible for famous series such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Manhunt. But which comes out on top? Just to clarify, you won’t see the likes of LA Noire or Max Payne 2 here, as we’ve strictly gone with Rockstar-developed games, rather than ones the studio has published. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account my personal enjoyment of each game over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/screenshot-2025-05-07-at-12-08-59-1746616161781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 is simply my favourite game of all time, so it was a pretty easy S-tier pick for me if I’m honest. It’s (perhaps unsurprisingly) joined its predecessor and GTA 5 in that category – both pioneers of the cinematic open world genre. I also have a particular soft spot for Max Payne 3 and its bullet time ballet, as well as GTA San Andreas (a game I played at a way too young age). Down at the bottom in the D-tier, we have the likes of Austin Powers: Oh, Behave! and Welcome to My Underground Lair!, a game that literally nobody in their right mind wants to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Vice City is better than GTA 4? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of Rockstar’s games yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We may have only seen two trailers so far, but where do you think GTA 6 will end up ranking when all is said and done?

Eagle-eyed fans spotted that the presidents on the cash seen in a screenshot of the club in GTA 6 are the same as those from Red Dead Redemption 2’s cigarette cards (Thaddeus Waxman and Franklin Hardin).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this is an incidental detail, and GTA and Red Dead existing in the same universe does not amount to much at the end of the day (although some are now suggesting Jason may be a descendant of Arthur Morgan, given the two look sort of alike). But it shows that there are connections between the two Rockstar IPs that may be strengthened further when GTA 6 comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto some juicy stuff. There is a brief moment in the trailer early on when Jason walks into his house, and the camera moves into what looks like an over the shoulder, third-person perspective. There is little sign of gameplay in Trailer 2, but fans are theorizing that this cutscene may seamlessly transition into the beginning of GTA 6, with players thrust into controlling Jason as he walks around his house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it may be the case that GTA 6 features two of these sections: one for Jason and one for Lucia, the game’s second playable protagonist. The theory here is that GTA 6 will feature a similar transition into gameplay moment for Lucia, helping the player get to grips with the dual protagonist gameplay ahead of the time-skip to when Lucia leaves prison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on, fans are focusing their attention on an image transition on the recently updated official GTA 6 website, which sees the camera swing around from spotlighting Jason to spotlighting Lucia as they share an embrace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if this is a character select screen that might display when you load the game. The expectation is you’ll be able to swap between Jason and Lucia during gameplay, but perhaps GTA 6 gives you the chance to pick between the two upon getting back into the game, and if so, this could be what we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of theories on the nature of Jason and Lucia’s relationship and where the story will take it. I’ve seen everything from speculation that Jason is an undercover cop to either Jason or Lucia or perhaps even both dying at the end of the story. Most seem convinced either Jason or Lucia betrays the other at some point, which would be criminal. Perhaps we’ll get to choose via an optional ending system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a note on the Jason is a cop theory: Jason tells the prison security guard, when picking up Lucia, that he might have been there before. In what capacity? Later, an older cop says, “Us cops, we’ve got to protect each other,” before the trailer cuts to Jason shooting at a moving car.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This leads on to a theory that GTA 6 may feature a third playable character that Rockstar is keeping secret so it’s a surprise to fans, and that this older cop may be it. Could you shift perspective to a cop hunting down Jason and Lucia during the story?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is a brilliantly silly fan theory: previous GTA games are <em>films</em> in the world of GTA 6. Phil Cassidy, the arms dealer from Vice City and GTA 3, is at the heart of this theory. In those games he’s missing an arm, but there is a character seen on Jason’s TV during the GTA 6 trailer that looks a lot like Cassidy — except he has both arms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s happening here? If this is indeed Cassidy, then how does he have both arms? Could the GTA 6 Cassidy be Phil Cassidy’s son? Or his grandson?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding to the confusion is GTA's seperated universes structure. The GTA series is divided into three distinct parallel universes, officially named by Rockstar North as the "2D Universe", "3D Universe," and the "HD Universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2D Universe includes the original top-down GTA games developed by DMA Design. The 3D Universe starts with GTA 3 and includes its prequels, such as Vice City. And the HD Universe starts with GTA 4 and includes GTA 5, GTA Online, and the upcoming GTA 6, with each game set in the same year it was released. Following this, GTA 6 will be set in 2026, aka the modern day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, while these are meant to be distinct parallel universes, there is a lot of crossover between them, with shared place names, characters, some lore, and more besides. But certainly no-one was expecting Phil Cassidy from Vice City to pop up in GTA 6, as it makes the 'distinct parallel universes' thing even trickier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps having GTA’s 3D Universe games as films in the ongoing HD Universe would help resolve these issues. We do see what looks like Phil Cassidy on Jason's TV, after all. Or, this Phil Cassidy has nothing more than a fun Easter egg Rockstar added to GTA 6 to spark exactly this kind of speculation.

                <p>With Nintendo announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/">Mario Kart World as an $80 launch game</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft also confirming</a> that its first-party titles will be sold at the same price, it looks like gaming is about to get a lot more expensive. Similarly to how base video game prices increased from $60 to $70 starting in 2020, other publishers will likely start to charge more for their products, but EA isn't currently planning to join this trend.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A session of its Q4 and FY2025 earnings conference call, EA was asked whether it would adopt a similar approach to other companies and adjust its "pricing power" for key IP in the future. "Our business is very different today than it was even just 10 years ago," EA CEO Andrew Wilson explained.</p><p>"In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, well that's still a part of our business. It's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond. At the end of the day, whether we’re doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p><p>"From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current strategy at this point," EA CFO Stuart Canfield added. It's worth noting that EA makes a <em>lot </em>of money from microtransactions. EA recorded $5.34 billion in this department in its 2025 financial year, and in comparison, video game sales brought in $2 billion in sales.</p><p>These comments come on the back of EA's publication of its fourth-quarter results for the three months ending on March 31, 2025. Wilson said that the company "significantly exceeded expectations" thanks primarily to games like EA Sports FC in Q4, The Sims, and Split Fiction. Live-service revenue also increased by 1% to $1.42 billion during this quarter, The Sims experienced the best growth in the history of the franchise, and total Split Fiction sales are nearly double what EA expected from the Hazelight Studios-developed game.</p><p>At the same time, it hasn't been smooth sailing at EA, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/">as hundreds of workers were laid off</a> and two "early-stage" incubation projects at Respawn Interactive were canceled.</p>

                <p>Payday 3 developer Starbreeze Studios has announced that it has reached an agreement with Plaion to acquire the publishing rights to the game. The company says that this deal will allow it to accelerate its content-development plans for Payday 3, and "pursue broader strategic opportunities" for the Payday franchise.</p><p>To secure the deal, Starbreeze issued $3.4 million in new shares--representing 10% of its outstanding share capital--with the bulk of the sales going toward repaying Plaion under its previous Payday 3 agreement and settling "certain outstanding" claims. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-enters-into-agreement-regarding-the-publishing-rights-for-payday-3-and-carries-out-a-directed-share-issue-of-class-b-shares-amounting-to-sek-33-million/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze has hinted</a> at new Payday projects in its announcement, as it'll continue to work with Plaion on "future Payday franchise" projects as part of its long-term strategy.</p><p>Following on the heels of the successful Payday 2, Payday 3 got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2023. The game was beset with various technical issues, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-sales-and-player-numbers-significantly-lower-than-hoped-for/1100-6521109/">low player numbers</a>, and a mandatory online-only requirement that proved to be very unpopular with the Payday community. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-ceo-is-gone-after-games-bad-start-and-low-player-numbers/1100-6521797/">Starbreeze's CEO Tobias Sjogren left the company in 2024</a> and the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-developer-knows-you-arent-satisfied-with-the-game-and-will-show-a-plan-next-month/1100-6520387/">announced plans to improve the game</a> through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-developer-knows-you-arent-satisfied-with-the-game-and-will-show-a-plan-next-month/1100-6520387/">various patches</a> as part of an effort titled Operation: Medic Bag.</p><p>Beyond Payday, Starbreeze is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dungeons-dragons-game-is-a-multiplayer-co-op-adventure-from-the-makers-of-payday/1100-6519684/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game for all major platforms</a>. Not much is known about the game, but it is expected to be released in 2026.</p>

                <p>If you've ever played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, you'll be familiar with the creeping overwhelm that can happen when returning to the game after a while, or if it's your first time playing. There are a lot of menu options, quests, triumphs, challenges, and more all housed within a complicated UI that many people seem to struggle to navigate easily. I recently returned to the game after a three-month hiatus and found myself blindly clicking to find the menus I needed--and that's as someone with more than 3,000 hours in the game.</p><p>During a reveal stream for the new expansion, The Edge of Fate, Bungie also outlined many quality-of-life upgrades and updates coming to the game. The most notable of these is a complete overhaul to the game's UI, which is now known as the Portal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858"></a><figcaption>The new Portal in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png"></figure><p>The Portal is a streamlined activity-selection screen, instantly showing the activities available at that time. There are different subsections within the Portal depending on the type of activity you want to play. These are split into Fireteam, Pinnacle, Crucible, and Solo Ops sections. Solo Ops is a new category that splits off smaller, shorter, self-contained gameplay sessions for those who want to play without the need for a fireteam.</p><p>You can also tailor the activities on offer depending on the rewards you're seeking. There are 50 new gameplay modifiers, which allow for the most customization in Destiny 2 so far. Activity rotations are now curated to provide variety and something new.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859"></a><figcaption>The Portal splits subsections into clear activities</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png"></figure><p>From looking at the improved UI and the introduction of the Portal, it's already clear that Bungie may have fixed the most frustrating problem with its space shooter to date. As an avid Destiny 2 fan I've found myself trying to convince my friends to jump in, but with a complex New Light experience that dumps new players into the game with little direction other than suggesting to follow a marker for a bit to see what happens, they were reluctant, to say the least.</p><p>Now, with the Portal, the next logical activity is highlighted in the bottom right of the interface, whether that's a new campaign mission, or the next activity you need in order to complete a specific quest or triumph.</p><p>The Portal will be added with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate release date</a>, which also introduces new Destiny 2 armor systems, weapons, and locations. The first of those new locations, Kepler, will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">customizable difficulty</a> options, further deepening your ability to play the game exactly as you'd like.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@grizzlybear1"> GRIZZLY BEAR</a>, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 VS GTA 5 GRAPHICS AND DETAILS COMPARISON" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ih0mVAGQfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise release of the game's second trailer</a>, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others.</p>
<p>Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a>, worldwide. The game was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/"> unsurprisingly</a> delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.</p>

            <p>Physical games remain vital to Nintendo players and developers should not "underestimate" this, an exec at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has said.</p>
<p>CD Projekt is currently getting ready to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">launch Cyberpunk 2077 on the Switch 2</a> and, unlike many games set to be released on Nintendo's new console, on its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch Cyberpunk 2077 will offer a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it.</p>
<p>This puts CD Projekt in the relative minority, as many other third party studios are instead favouring 'key cards' for their own Switch 2 releases. These key cards don't actually contain game data, and instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device.</p>

<p>But while there has been a general lean towards digital media over the past few years, CD Projekt says it has used its learnings from releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the original Switch when deciding upon a physical Switch 2 release for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>Having Cyberpunk 2077 as a "cartridge with a plug and play experience" on Switch 2 was "the right thing to do",   CD Projekt's VP of business development Jan Rosner told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>. The exec noted the original Switch's internal storage was "way lower than it is now", and a "game like The Witcher 3 would take up to 80 percent of your internal memory if you don't have an external memory card".</p>
<p>Nintendo players "are quite receptive" to that "plug and play experience", Rosner furthered, and so CDPR knew having a physical cartridge version of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 with no download required was "a goal that we wanted to achieve" from early on.</p>
<p>"Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere," he said, adding he doesn't see "a reality where we're just having all games digital" for a while yet.</p>
<p>"It's especially important for the Nintendo audience," the exec continued. "We maybe could have got away with [a key card], but is there a point? The right thing to do was to have it out on the cartridge with a plug and play experience."</p>
<p>Rosner advises other studios to "not underestimate the physical edition", saying this form of media is "not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CD Projekt</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the same conversation, Rosner said he believes that we will see "more and more third-party titles on the [Switch 2], which we may not necessarily expect" on the original Switch.</p>
<p>"The previous generation has proven to be so successful, and there [are] so many more players to be reached with that, and I think that the [console's capabilities] will surely allow it," he said.</p>
<p>This seems like a more than reasonable assumption. After all, along with Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Hazelight's Split Fiction will also be a Switch 2 launch title</a>. Other third party titles also confirmed for the platform include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a>, although these won't be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date">available on the console's release</a>.</p>
<p>So, with all that said and done, does it seem likely we will also see a Switch 2 version of The Witcher 3 further down the line? Well, the studio is skirting that question for now and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-the-witcher-3-get-a-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-skirts-issue-for-now-as-its-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077">CD Projekt told Eurogamer it is "all in on Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition" on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with Nintendo goes back to the original Nintendo Switch, where we released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We were happy with how that game was received by players so, when we heard about the more powerful Nintendo Switch 2, we immediately thought it would be the perfect platform for Cyberpunk 2077," CD Projekt's gameplay technical design expert Filip Downar told Eurogamer, adding that the studio was "thrilled" to be working with Nintendo again.</p>

The former is paid content while the latter will be available to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Rite of the Nine, a "fresh take on dungeon diving for both seasoned dungeon crawlers and those stepping into the depths for the first time" that is already available to all players for no additional cost. While the dungeons themselves — Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher, and Ghosts of the Deep — will be familiar to some, even the most hardened Guardian can expect "unique twists" in which you'll reconnect with Orin and refreshed dungeon weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on July 15, we'll get the brand-new expansion, Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate, a "multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions." A paid-for expansion, The Edge of Fate will reintroduce us to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, as two characters "step into the spotlight" — new ally Lodi and Warlock Vanguard, Ikora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion will take place on new destination Kepler, described as "inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." Expect new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific abilities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, on July 15, "major core game innovations" will roll out, including revised armor and gear systems "to create richer opportunities for buildcrafting" and a new activity selection screen called the Portal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players will be able to easily choose between Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and the newly introduced Solo Ops," Bungie explained. "Fireteam Ops and Pinnacle Ops reinforce quick fireteam action and longer-form cooperative content, while the new Solo Ops activities are specifically designed for solo players who want short, self-contained gameplay sessions without the need for a fireteam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, players can tailor activities to match their desired gameplay and the specific rewards they are chasing. 50 all-new modifiers will allow deeper gameplay customization and offer greater challenges for players, while curated activity rotations will ensure there is always something new to chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As typically happens with a new expansion, pre-order sweeteners are available, including an instantly unlockable Exotic Ghost and Legendary Emblem.

Alalshikh acquired American publication The Ring back in November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the tweet, the untitled game will feature original characters and combine "The Ring’s unmatched authority in boxing with game developer Dimps’ decades-long experience in crafting classic games."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Together with legendary Japanese video game designer Takashi Nishiyama, I am proud to announce a forthcoming boxing game presented by The Ring featuring original characters. </p><p>This strategic partnership between myself and Nishiyama brings together our unmatched authority in… <a href="https://t.co/LRWyyZzkpz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LRWyyZzkpz</a></p></div>— TURKI ALALSHIKH (@Turki_alalshikh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Turki_alalshikh/status/1919238688808051145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Dimps is Takashi Nishiyama’s company. Its most recent game was Freedom Wars Remastered, a reworking of a PlayStation Vita game for modern consoles released in January 2025. According to the tweet from Alalshikh, development of the boxing title will begin soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Saudi Arabian royal family has become increasingly invested in Japan’s gaming industry in recent years. In April 2024, it was revealed that 100% of Japanese game company SNK’s shares were now owned by the Saudi Crown Prince’s foundation. The Ring Magazine has also been involved in promoting SNK’s upcoming Fatal Fury: City of Wolves, hosting a <a href="https://www.boxxer.com/events/fatal-fury-chris-eubank-jr-vs-conor-benn-26-apr-2025-tottenham-hotspur-stadium-london/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>boxing match collaboration</u></a> at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London on April 26, 2025.

It will be interesting to see whether The Ring and Dimps’ new boxing game goes for a realistic or rule-breaking approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

In a post on its <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/3eFYYUUqzOpOSv086XWMh9/starfield-update-notes-may" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Bethesda called for feedback, and published patch notes, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update does little more than add a few new features and make bug fixes, which means Starfield players are still waiting for news on potential DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space-set RPG Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years. But it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite reaching 15 million players, some wondered whether Bethesda might walk away from Starfield to focus on its other franchises. Bethesda itself has said it has "exciting things" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">speculation that <u>Starfield</u> would soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5</a> ramped up after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website. The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans were left wondering whether Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game would soon make the jump to PS5.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-starfield-companions-and-crew" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to forget about Starfield given all the attention on Oblivion Remastered, its players are hoping that Microsoft and Bethesda go big on Starfield at its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct">Xbox Games Showcase broadcast</a> on June 8.

            <p>EA won't be raising the price of its games, as the company aims to "deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase".</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson responded to a question on whether it would be following the likes of Nintendo and Xbox in raising the price of its new releases this year.</p>
<p>Wilson noted how the "pricing power" of the business is very different today than a decade ago, with physical releases a "significantly smaller" part of the business and a range of price points from free-to-play to deluxe editions "and beyond".</p>

<p>"At the end of the day whether we're doing something that costs a dollar or we're doing something that costs $10 or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase," said Wilson. "And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p>
<p>EA CFO Stuart Canfield surmised the company has "no changes in the current strategy at this point".</p>
<p>The company's latest financial report states EA's net bookings for the last financial year totaled $7.355bn. It's essentially flat, with FY24 totalling $7.43bn and FY23 totalling $7.34bn, evidence of the resilience Wilson spoke of.</p>
<p>Interestingly, live services represented 73 percent of total net bookings for the latest financial year. Further, EA's American Football franchise exceeded expectations by reaching over a billion in net bookings, helping EA Sports to its biggest net bookings year ever.</p>
<p>The Sims also had "double digital growth" in the most recent quarter, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-praises-split-fiction-hugely-successful-launch-as-game-passes-another-sales-milestone">Split Fiction has now sold almost 4m units</a> since its release in March.</p>
<p>In short, the company is doing very well. And with the continued success of its annual sports games and high revenue generated from live service games, there's clearly no need to raise the price of its games just yet.</p>
<p>Speaking to wider economic factors, Wilson said: "Even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macro-economic downturn, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by fans for raising the price of its games with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, as its flagship launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will cost £75/$80. The company has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">stated this is not a new "benchmark"</a> but an example of "variable pricing".</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">raised the price of its Xbox consoles</a>, with some new games rising to $80 by the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sponge away the dross and ephemera of my life and you're left with a series of moments in which I wonder: is <em>now</em> the right time to get into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-legend-of-heroes">Legend of Heroes</a>? I've been planning to play Nihon Falcom's 17-part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series ever since a respected peer gently suggested that my enthusiasm for Final Fantasy and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> marked me out as a Basic Bitch, and that if I ever want to experience a <em>real</em> role-playing game, I should give LoH a go.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I am held back by a number of things: 1) the Legend Of Heroes games are mega-normous, possibly 2) because they're meandering and overstuffed, for all their quality, and 3) nobody I've spoken to can agree on which I should start with. I did have a breakthrough recently, coming to the conclusion that I should get the ball rolling with The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky, the sixth game from 2004 - it's the one I see most often in GOAT threads, and the first in a distinct subseries. But now Nihon Falcom have ruined everything by plotting to remake it. Titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</a>, the remake will launch on 19th September (as revealed in Famitsu, via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19">Gematsu</a>). Here's the most recent trailer.

<p>
If you're familiar with Trails In The Sky, the key differences here are: new HD visuals, new voiceovers, and "the choice of traditional turn-based combat or all-new, real-time action combat", as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/">the Steam page</a>. Great: not only do I now have to decide whether to play the original game or the remake first, I also now have to pick between old and new flavours of battling. Why do you vex me, Nihon Falcom.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I consistently hear about the Trails games is that the NPC and world writing are absolutely excellent: generous to the point of exhausting, with every NPC worth returning to. If you've played it, please do not leave a comment expounding upon these or any other virtues. It will only add to my choice paralysis. I've read that anger freezes into depression if left unexpressed. Is there a point where FOMO metamorphs into a full-on midlife crisis?

That button is blacked out on the regular ROG, though will likely be replaced or removed in its production version.</p><p><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/"><em>91mobiles</em></a> found listings for the ROG Ally 2 at the Indonesian certificate, and <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked"><em>VideoCardz</em></a> linked those to an <a href="https://device.report/fccid/msq-mt7922a12l">FCC listing</a> for the Wi-Fi module included in the two devices, which includes photos of the hardware. That listing also reveals some limited specs, which include a 7-inch, 120Hz LCD display — about the same as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">the first generation</a> — with an 8-core, 36W AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme CPU included in the Xbox edition, and a less powerful 4-core, 20W chip in the white version.</p><p>The design has also been altered, with more molded controller grips on each edge, rather than the blocky, sloped design of the ROG Ally. That leaves the hardware as a whole looking thicker than before, but perhaps it’ll be more comfortable to hold.</p><p>With certification already under way, it’s likely that a release is around the corner. Asus often launches hardware at Computex, which begins on May 20th — just one day after Microsoft’s own Build conference begins on May 19th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
