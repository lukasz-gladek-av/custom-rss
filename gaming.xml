            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There aren’t many games I recommend as wholeheartedly as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><span>2021’s </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i></a><span>. GoodbyeWorld Games’ brisk, beautiful narrative adventure game is a devastating, cathartic, and clever project that rolls a lifetime’s worth of ups and downs into its quick 90-minute play time. Its eye-tracking control scheme is one of the most meaningfully frustrating ones I’ve experienced, as it skips through entire segments of its story every time your webcam sees you blink. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>, the follow-up from Nice Dream Games, extrapolates this idea into a 3-and-a-half-hour experience, and it feels like turning a really tight Pixar short into a feature film, for good and ill.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>has the same sentimentality running through its veins that made </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>an incredibly heartwarming story despite the tragedy at its center, but it’s far less introspective. The new release</span> <span>is the story of a baby named Isaac who, somehow, has adult-level intelligence, though he can’t communicate that to his frazzled mother, spritely sister, and suspiciously chill father. But because he has an adult’s intuition, he can observe all the chaos of their lives and try his best to be a helpful son and brother. Sometimes that takes the form of just being a chill baby who isn’t causing trouble; at other times, he gets a bit more hands-on. What can a baby who can barely crawl do as his family navigates all their adult bullshit? A lot, actually, because Isaac has psychic powers.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>was entirely built around eye-tracking tech as a bit of narrative design, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s implementation of a webcam is far more mechanical in the traditional sense. Blinking activates Isaac’s psychic abilities in a way that often changes depending on the situation. It can shut down machinery, help you clean up a mess in your bedroom, and if you close your eyes and turn your head, you can listen in on your family’s worried thoughts. In this game, blinking is basically an extra button that certainly still feels novel, but it’s not quite as effective in what it communicates. </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>made an entire mechanic out of “blink and you’ll miss it,” but when </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>uses the same webcam-based control scheme, it feels like something that could have just as easily been communicated by pressing a different button on your controller. In a way, it feels more like a reference to the team’s previous history than it does something truly integrated into everything </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>seeks to explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the later game sequences, in which </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>sheds some of its focus on its supernatural family story in favor of some surprisingly dark science fiction and espionage twists, have you blinking as Isaac navigates mazes of obstacles and threats to his safety, and the game registers these inputs based on where your cursor is if you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard. I played through all of </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>with headphones to listen in on my family’s thoughts and a webcam to blink my psychic will onto the world around me, but in its effort to stretch out </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>’ concise ideas into something longer,&nbsp; </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>fails to develop as strong of a grasp on why it’s implementing these ideas, beyond the team wanting this approach to gameplay to feel like a signature facet of their work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642520"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642520">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to keep comparing </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, but the contrast between the two is one of the most interesting things about Isaac’s journey. It’s about twice as long, but doesn’t feel like it overstays its welcome, even if it’s lacking the same singular vision. The game’s psychic set pieces are more mechanical, but they’re doused in a childlike mischief and naivete that is delightful, and that makes the moments when reality intervenes as devastating as any slap on the wrist you received as a kid. Despite Isaac’s adult-level intellect and grown-ass voiceover from </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span>*</span> <span>actor Lewis Pullman, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>hits at childhood shame, embarrassment, and familial resentment like they’re all raw nerves. Then it gradually becomes about so many other things that even gesturing at its many twists and turns risks spoiling it entirely.</span></p> <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>runs with every idea it has with a childlike confidence, but it’s also such a different story by the end than it is at the start that I wouldn’t be surprised if people find that one half of its tale resonates with them, while the other falls flat. When it’s at its best, it feels like being cradled and read your favorite story; then come moments when it’s as if the reader got bored with one story and picked up an altogether different one. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in a heartwarming message at the end, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster getting there. At least it’s worth riding for the highs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 9‘s Vivi Has Finally Been Banned From Magic: The Gathering]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/vivi-ornitier-cauldron-ban-mtg-final-fantasy-2000642504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9%E2%80%98s-vivi-has-finally-been-banned-from-magic-the-gathering.1349158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vivi is a small and unassuming Black Mage caught in an existential crisis in<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy IX</em> and an absolute wrecking ball <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364">in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The clever, lovable riff on a classic RPG archetype was responsible for what many considered the most busted deck in the card game’s current format. Fans have been waiting for him to be banned from Edge of Eternities Standard for months. Today, it finally happened.</p>

 <p>Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-november-10-2025">revealed</a> its updated banned and restricted list on November 10 as promised and, sure enough, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</a> was on it. The 0/3 Wizard gets a +1/+1 counter and deals 1 damage to each opponent every time you cast a noncreature spell, but that’s not all. Once per turn, players also get to use Vivi to generate red and blue mana equal to his power.</p>

 <p>At just three mana to play, Vivi’s a very powerful, very versatile card. Pair it with <a href="https://aetherhub.com/Metagame/Traditional-Standard/Deck/ur-soul-cauldron-1348701">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>, which stacks more +1/+1 counters and gives creatures access to all exiled creatures’ abilities, and you have a recipe for the most dominant and annoying deck of the year.</p>

 <p>“God, Vivi-Cauldron decks make for miserable games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1nbwgh6/rant_god_vivicauldron_decks_make_for_miserable/">wrote</a> one player months ago. “The worst part are repetitive, monotonous play patterns and waiting for my opponent to take 5-minute turns when they had lethal on board after 30 seconds.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3">https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3</a> <a href="https://t.co/bADvMaFx4u">pic.twitter.com/bADvMaFx4u</a></p> <p>— Dr. Perplexed (@drperplexed) <a href="https://twitter.com/drperplexed/status/1987959578399535473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As a result, Vivi Cauldron was dominating top-deck lists and driving up the prices of the relevant cards to ridiculous post-launch levels. Some players were looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1mj8va3/the_vivi_cauldron_deck_is_8001000_in_paper/">prices of over $400</a> to build competitive decks with Vivi Ornitier, only falling <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631015/magic-final-fantasy-vivi-ornitier?srsltid=AfmBOooPpIF-JpPxhFkm4z1dPrbgI3gTepv91SKyFS8973Cjz2PhqdFp">below $30 apiece</a> once the autumn hit. Things got so bad in competitive <em>MtG </em>that Wizards of the Coast stepped in back in September to try and quell frustrations.</p>

 <p>“With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span>, and speculations on ’emergency’&nbsp; bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in,” read a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement">blog post from September</a>.</p>

 <p>While Wizards didn’t act then, it took the unusual step of bumping up its normal ban date by two weeks and promised a stricter crackdown on broken cards in 2026. The saga of Vivi Ornitier, while great for <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans happy to see one of the series’ unsung heroes shine, reinforced skepticism that many <em>MtG</em> players have had for <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">the Beyond Universes sets,</a> which some feel prioritize flashy fan service at the expense of obvious power creep.</p> <p>“To open up the Standard format for innovation and a wider variety of decks, it’s clear we need to disrupt the <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span> combo,” Wizards wrote in today’s banned card update. “That interaction is too much stronger than the rest of the format. We are opting to ban Vivi Ornitier as it is the card that’s more likely to create future balance problems if allowed to remain in the format. We believe Standard will be more fun and diverse without Vivi Ornitier in it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, called Endgame, has been revealed by Activision. The open-world mode, which will unlock after completing the campaign, furthers the multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>With Black Ops 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer is the main focus</a>. Its campaign, playable solo or co-op, does differ from previous entries, but it plans to expand on the narrative of Black Ops 2 and the Mason family. Despite returning to the somewhat-controversial futuristic settings of past games, it’s still poised to be one of 2025’s biggest titles. Ahead of its November 14th release, the team has revealed a new mode that plans to expand the narrative after the credits roll.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-endgame-mode-unlocks-after-campaign-goes-open-world">Black Ops 7’s Endgame Mode Unlocks After Campaign, Goes Open-World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a Dev Talk, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-endgame#PvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as well as a blog</a>, Activision has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally announced</a> that a new launch mode will be available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Titled Endgame, it’s unlocked after players complete the 11 main missions in the base campaign. In the mode, you and up to three other players will be dropped onto an island called Avalon and take on various objectives. </p>



<p>The mode will allow for up to 32 players to one map and be divided into four sections, each with various recommended levels. You get to choose between four Operator classes and customize your loadout before dropping. In addition, progress in the mode contributes to your overall ranking, unifying all modes for experience. More details about the mode can be found on the blog, linked here.</p>



<p>An open-world style of gameplay was tried before in Call of Duty with 2023’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/review-modern-warfare-3-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> to little praise. Still, it seems like the team is committed to delivering a great new experience for fans. If anything, it does encourage players to try out the campaign and get a cool reward for doing so. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares against the usual Multiplayer and Zombies modes and, if successful, return for future games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seven Deadly Sins: Origin Preview: It's a Whole Vibe, and the Combat’s Not Bad, Either]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combats-not-bad-either</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combat%E2%80%99s-not-bad-either.1349149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you go into a game not really knowing much about it. I knew exactly three things going into Seven Deadly Sins: Origin: one, it is based on the popular Seven Deadly Sins manga/anime; two, it is an action-RPG; and three, that I could play it on PC or PS5. I looked at it long enough to decide that it could be up my alley, and then dived into its closed beta test blind. And I’m happy I did. Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is an impressive game, even with its gacha mechanics, and I enjoyed hanging out in its world and spending time with its characters. Oh, and the combat? That’s not bad, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven Deadly Sins: Origin follows Prince Tristan of Liones and Tioreh. After stumbling upon a strange cave inside a tree (that’s not a typo), our heroes discover a mysterious pendant called the Book of Stars that seems to have mystical powers neither of them fully understand. When they emerge from the cave after a knock-down, drag-out brawl against a surprisingly large and hostile golem, our heroes discover that the world is a little different than when they left it. The topography’s changed, creatures that are supposed to be extinct are running around in living color, and Hawk – everyone’s favorite flying ham – was being chased by a dragon. He’s not really sure how he ended up here – he could have sworn he was in Purgatory – but he’s down to clown with Tristan and Tioreh while they figure out what’s going on. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and this weird black corruption is springing up all over, long-dead heroes are showing up to cause problems, and there’s this mysterious scholar named Clotho who seems to know both everything about the Book of Stars, which can magically restore broken things, and where Tristan and Tioreh are going to be before they get there. Time travel shenanigans? Multiple timelines? Something funky’s going on, y’all, and our intrepid crew are going to get to the bottom of it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What sells The Vibe™ of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is how it looks. It’s absolutely stunning.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story here is fun (and very well-acted, though there was no English dub in the beta, so everything I heard was in Japanese), but what sells The Vibe™ of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is how it looks. It’s absolutely stunning, but what impressed me most was how well-animated everything was. There’s a particularly great scene where Tristan is trying to hand over the Book of Stars, only to find it’s stuck to his hand, that had me rolling, but there’s a lot of really great moments here. Seven Deadly Sins: Origin has a story to tell, and you can tell its developers have taken that responsibility seriously.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s a solid action game here, too. Origin is an action-RPG at heart, and there’s meat on this combat’s bone. In addition to a standard defensive dash (the only way you’ll be blocking in Origin is with your face), each character comes with a standard combo, a couple of special attacks, and an ultimate that can range from calling in some fireballs to transforming into a demon. These distinctions are what gives each character flavor, and I really enjoyed playing around with them, whether I was buffing my standard fire attacks with Tioreh or using Howzer’s wind-based strikes, and everything in-between. And yes, characters like Diane are here, too. Just… smaller than you might figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since each character’s abilities are associated with an element, it’s good to have a balanced team. You can have up to four characters traveling with you at once, and switch to them on the fly. Play your cards right, and they’ll even come in with an attack. The twist is that your whole team shares a health bar; there’s no switching characters when you’re running low on health to save the day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is about managing your cooldowns, landing hits when you can, and most importantly, not getting hit. Origin is kind enough to show you where large attacks are going to be ahead of time, and smaller hits generally have enough windup so that you can get out of the way if you’re paying attention and not just mashing buttons. This isn’t Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but there’s some juice here, and combat feels good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isn’t Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but there’s some juice here, and combat feels good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not all about hitting things with all manner of sharp and blunt objects. You can also collect materials in the world and use them to craft potions to keep you alive in a pinch, cook a delicious meal, or upgrade your characters with permanent stat buffs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot to explore. Soon after meeting Hawk, I could ride him around, and like seemingly every video game released since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you can climb on objects in the environment if you’ve got the stamina for it, and glide down from high places. All of this is good because the world of Britannia is absolutely massive. You can teleport around if you activate the fancy fast-travel stones scattered around the environment, but that means you gotta find ‘em first. So, you know, be prepared to do a little walking. Or pig-riding.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But spending time in the world means you’ll get to do Origin’s sidequests. They’re simple stuff, and, as you’d expect, not nearly as well-produced as the story beats, but I enjoyed trying to help out a crying kid and got a kick out of a castle worker who was so lazy that I had to deliver food for her. Stuff like that makes the world feel more lived in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing about Seven Deadly Sins: Origin that gives me pause, it’s the gacha-ness of it all. I’m inherently wary of gacha and other reward systems built on gambling, and Origin is one of those games. It seems fairly easy to get enough currency to roll the dice, but the beta throws currency at you, and it’s hard to get a sense of the economics of something when that happens. Whether or not that will be true in the full game remains to be seen. The UI also feels designed for a mouse and keyboard in a way that makes it awkward to navigate on a controller, especially when you’re managing a lot of gear. It’s not gamebreaking, but it’s something I wonder about when it comes to a full release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent about five hours with Seven Deadly Sins: Origin, unlocking several characters, opening up the ability to party up with other players, and taking the main quest far enough that Tristan and Tioreh got to the point that they’d demonstrated enough skill to be trusted to head to the Fairy King Forest. That seemed like a natural place to stop, but before I did, I wanted to take on one of the beta’s optional bosses. In my case, it was a red demon who belched fire and had a thing for belly flops, and another weird looking thing with arms that were doubling as legs. I couldn’t beat either, mostly because I just wasn’t doing enough damage. My choices were clear: level up, get more gear, and play more gacha to Get My Numbers Up, but I opted out. I’d seen the fights, which were fun enough that I wanted to play them again if I jumped in at release, and I was tired of fiddling with the inventory screen. End on a high note.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, going into a game blind can be the best thing you can do for yourself. I enjoyed spending time in Seven Deadly Sins: Origin’s world, hanging out with its characters, and riding around a flying hog. And yeah, the fighting stuff part was pretty solid, too. I’m always wary of gacha elements in games, but the core of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin got my attention. The only question is whether it can hold it when it comes out next year. I wouldn’t mind a rematch with a couple of those bosses, but I’m not in a rush. They’ll be there when I return to Britannia.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combats-not-bad-either]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If there's a common complaint about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311" data-mce-href="/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, it's that the game can be punishingly hard at times. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577" data-mce-href="/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/">PC Patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but the game's newest update goes even further by nerfing the damned Muckmaggots that make things so difficult in Bilewater and the Putrified Ducts.</p><p>The Muckmaggots previously ate Hornet's silk with impunity, and even binding these creatures forced players to use what little silk they had to hold them back. The update makes it easier to clear out the Muckmaggots with the Wreath of Purity, which gives Hornet a chance to heal herself by using a second bind.</p><p>Silksong's Chinese translation has also been updated with fan-made translation by Team Cart Fit. Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">praised the new translation</a> by calling it "well-versed in the (quite dense) narrative and lore of both Hollow Knight games" and thanked the members of the team for letting the studio use it. The earlier Chinese translation drew criticisms from native Chinese speakers and led to the game being review-bombed.</p><p>Some of the other beneficial changes in the patch include the elimination of the same delivery in a row from couriers, as well as enabling rumble comparability with more controllers. However, the game is making Gurr the Outcast a little bit harder to fight by decreasing the time he stands unmoving.</p><p>The latest patch is currently only available for PC users, but Silksong players on consoles will get it in the near future. The complete patch notes are included below.</p><h2>Hollow Knight: Silksong Patch 4 (1.0.29242) Notes</h2><ul><li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation to use fan translation provided by Team Cart Fix.</li><li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support.

			<p>ARC Raiders continues to hit new heights of success for developer and publisher Embark Studios, which has confirmed that over the past weekend, across all available platforms, ARC Raiders surpassed 700K concurrent players.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a>, we can get a look at any game's concurrent players to help gauge how it is doing popularity-wise and, to a lesser extent, sales. But neither PlayStation nor Xbox shares player numbers in the same way, so the number of players on console remains a mystery, for the most part.</p>



<p>So while we can't know exactly how many players ARC Raiders had on PlayStation and Xbox consoles over the weekend, looking at the SteamDB page for the game, we can see that most of those 700K came from PC, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">a new peak of 462,488 players playing ARC Raiders on Steam alone just yesterday</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Raiders!<br>It's been a little over one week since we opened up the tunnels for you to head Topside, and this past weekend we reached over 700,000 concurrent Raiders on the surface! 🥳<br>We're so happy to have you all here!<br>The many different ways you play and participate in ARC… <a href="https://t.co/Do6bAhWf4o">pic.twitter.com/Do6bAhWf4o</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1987930324156678210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's another milestone for the game, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">reportedly already surpassed 2.5 million copies sold</a> (most of those, unsurprisingly, coming from Steam), and has not fallen below 100K concurrent players on Steam since it launched on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that it has definitively had a strong launch, the question becomes whether Embark Studios can turn the strong launch into a strong month, into a strong first year, and beyond. For now, ARC Raiders is having its moment in the spotlight in the gaming industry, but that won't mean much if the game isn't around in a couple of years.</p>



<p>Not that it's likely to disappear anytime soon. Embark Studios has already proven it knows how to make a multiplayer game people want to play and keep it going with The Finals, and ARC Raiders is having a bigger launch than The Finals. </p>



<p>Either way, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders continues to evolve. Embark <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">currently has the game roadmapped for the rest of 2025</a>, though there's nothing publicly on the schedule yet for 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Company Used Fake Reddit Posts To Advertise Game, Then Deleted The Evidence]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/company-used-fake-reddit-posts-to-advertise-game-then-deleted-the-evidence.1349122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Trap Plan, a large video game marketing company, admitted that it used multiple fake Reddit accounts to help promote a game called <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em>, pretending to be “authentic” fans and players who just happened to discover the mech game and wanted to share it with others. Trap Plan has since deleted the post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ot0nvg/game_dev_admits_to_large_astroturfing_campaign_on/">but not before folks on Reddit spotted it.</a></p>

 <p>On November 9, <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/about-us">Trap Plan</a> CEO and “marketing expert” Pavel Beresnev posted a short article to the agency’s official website. The post, titled “How we promote <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em> on Reddit,” goes into detail about how the agency used multiple Reddit accounts to create over 40 posts across multiple subreddits, including r/pcmasterrace and r/PlayStation5, to create “a wave of organic visibility before the next Twitch activation.”</p>

 <p>“The content varied from short clips and GIFs to&nbsp;‘I found this game…’ discovery-style posts,&nbsp;screenshot threads, and&nbsp;light discussion prompts about tactical mech combat and movement mechanics,” explained the CEO. “We avoided direct promotion and focused on&nbsp;native conversation formats. Players discussed the game naturally — asking questions, comparing it to&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MechWarrior</em>, and sharing opinions about tactical mechanics.”</p>

 <p>According to Beresnev, in order to make the posts feel “authentic,” the team played the game, recorded footage, and posted about what they had played. “This created a steady stream of credible, varied content that matched Reddit’s organic tone,” said Beresnev.&nbsp; After sharing some stats about the campaign’s effectiveness, the CEO concluded the post by saying, “Most players didn’t even realize they were part of a marketing effort.”</p>

 <p>At some point in the last 24 hours, the post was seemingly <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">deleted from Trap Plan’s website.</a> If you try to read the Reddit marketing article now, it just takes you to a 404 page. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110014044/https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">However, it was saved by someone via the Internet Archive</a>, allowing us to see the post as it appeared on Sunday.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Trap Plan and <em>WarRobots</em> developer My.Games about the post and the Reddit marketing strategy.</p> <p>As many pointed out on Reddit, this is far from the first time we’ve heard about a marketing agency or publisher using fake accounts to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/">create an astroturf campaign for a video game</a>. But it is odd to see a marketing agency’s CEO so publicly and directly confirm what was done and how it was done. It makes you wonder how many social media posts on sites like Reddit and Twitter are actually written by real fans and how many were trying to trick you into becoming part of a larger marketing campaign.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, you have the next CoD game, but also the continuation of the Black Ops saga. It allows Treyarch to flex its muscles once more, and if you can’t wait to play Black Ops 7, knowing its launch times is the perfect weapon.</p>



<p>Between a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> content, Black Ops 7’s fascinating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endgame</a> content, and the usual year-long multiplayer madness, you’ve got a lot to keep you busy in BLOPS 7. The title neatly wraps up this mini-chapter in Call of Duty history, which can lead to a nice break for Treyarch as it works on its next entry.</p>



<p>For now, let’s enjoy Black Ops 7 and find out its launch times.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-live">When Is Black Ops 7 Live?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Do the robot! Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 first goes live at 9:00 PM PST on November 13.</strong></p>



<p>Whereas November 14 is considered the default release date for Black Ops 7, a small handful of areas technically get access on November 13—lucky you!</p>



<p>We know many of the launch times for key regions around the world. To make this easier, here’s a complete list showing you each highlighted region and what time and date Black Ops 7 is available there.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Launch Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">11:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EST</td><td data-align="center">12:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">BRT</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">6:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">SAST</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">KST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEDT</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM-November 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there is no early access for the Campaign, Zombies, or Multiplayer this year in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>There’s not much to add. There was initial speculation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Campaign and Zombies were set to release four days early.</a> However, while Activision didn’t address the speculation directly, the company covered the rumor by stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-early-access-activision-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 doesn’t have early access</a>—breaking all of our hearts in the process.</p>



<p>Still, there are only a few days to go now. As long as you have your referenced timezone on hand, you should know when the new Call of Duty goes live in your digital storefront. Furthermore, for more help on this, we also have an in-depth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 preload guide</a>, showing you how to set this up and enable you to play the second Black Ops 7 drops!</p>



<p>It also covers the game’s excessive file sizes across all formats. We hope this and our other CoD guides are answering your biggest questions about the latest CoD release.

The short begins with Homer being given some useful exposition from resident <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">The Simpsons</a> scientist Professor Frink, until Homer turns the scientist into new version of Fortnite banana Peely (soon to be available as a skin to battle pass holders).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Homer causes a rain of giant donuts to fall down from the sky — something players will experience this coming week in-game — Springfield's residents turn against Homer. The second half of the short then seemingly sets up <em>next </em>week's Fortnite theme, where Homer manages to clone himself and somehow create a form of zombie army.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite plans to release a further two Simpsons shorts which will be available online or via Disney+ across the latter half of its Springfield mini-season, which is due to culminate in a big in-game live event on November 29.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Todd Howard isn’t a big fan of talking about his video games, but in a new interview he has discussed Fallout 4’s divisive dialogue system — and where he thinks it went wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> — which turns 10 today, November 10, alongside the release of an Anniversary Edition — broke away from what the post-apocalyptic role-playing game franchise had done in previous entries and gave the playable character a voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only that, but Fallout 4 shifted the traditional first-person, zoomed in camera perspective for dialogue in favor of a dynamic, third-person camera perspective more in keeping with a cinematic, Mass Effect style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Fallout 4 dialogue is typically determined by a handful of short summaries, usually lining up with positive, inquisitive, sarcastic, and negative responses. It is not possible to select exact answers, and some players criticized the dialogue choices for not having a meaningful impact on the outcome of conversations, quests, or events either way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Fallout 4 went on to become a hugely successful release for Bethesda, with 12 million copies shipped to retailers within the first 24 hours representing $750 million in revenue, Fallout fans never really warmed to its dialogue system, and indeed there are a number of mods available that make significant changes to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> (the one where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">he reveals The Elder Scrolls 6 is still some way away</a>), Bethesda development chief Todd Howard singled out Fallout 4’s dialogue system as something from one of his games that failed to “resonate” with fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,” Howard said. “How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way. Players want to role-play more and we had a voiced protagonist. The actors were phenomenal, but a lot of players were like, ‘That's not the voice I hear in my head.’”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Fallout Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It was telling that for 2023’s Starfield, Bethesda reverted to a silent protagonist with lines of dialogue the player could choose from and the first-person perspective seen in The Elder Scrolls games and pre-Fallout 4 entries in the Fallout series. It seems likely that Bethesda will leave Fallout 4’s dialogue system behind, so I don't expect to see it in the upcoming The Elder Scrolls 6, for example, or indeed Fallout 5, whenever it gets around to making that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a more positive note, Howard said he thinks Fallout 3 has the best opening of any game he’s worked on (I agree!), Starfield has the best gunplay and “gameplay in areas” (agree on the gunplay bit, not sure on the gameplay bit), while the varied landscape of Fallout 76 is “really good” (yep, I'll give him that). Skyrim is, “tonally and player agency-wise… really good,” Howard added, and I doubt anyone would argue with that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Those additional options should be welcome news for fans looking for new ways to play PC games of a certain era. The PC Gaming Wiki <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Direct3D_2-7_games">lists over 400 titles</a> written with the D3D7 APIs, and while most of those games were released between 2000 and 2004, a handful of new D3D7 games have continued to be released through 2022.</p>
<p>The D3D7 games list predictably includes a lot of licensed shovelware, but there are also well-remembered games like <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, and the original <em>Hitman: Codename 47</em>. WinterSnowfall writes that the project was inspired by a desire to play games like <em>Sacrifice</em> and <em>Disciples II</em> on top of the existing dxvk framework.</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/issues">known issues with certain D3D7 titles</a>, WinterSnowfall writes that recent tuning means “things are now anywhere between decent to stellar in most of the supported games.” Still, the project author warns that the project will likely never reach full compatibility since “D3D7 is a land of highly cursed API interoperability.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect this project to expand to include support for even older DirectX APIs, either, WinterSnowfall warns. “D3D7 is enough of a challenge and a mess as it is,” the author writes. “The further we stray from D3D9, the further we stray from the divine.”</p>

This was because discovering Waypoints and uncovering fog of war from the map was tied to Diablo 4's zone-based Renown system, which partially reset each season.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fzBb0OsE0AY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 11, that will no longer be the case. In an interview with Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuQ</a>, lead live game designer Colin Finer said players who skip the campaign at the start of a new season will have all Waypoints unlocked. Skipping the campaign requires players to have completed it once before.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big change that will make the start of each new season go significantly faster, as players will no longer need to mount up and manually travel to various locations, unlocking Waypoints along the way. Instead, Waypoints will be available from the start, letting players quickly and easily travel to wherever they need to go, which should substaintially speed up the start of each season.</p><p dir="ltr">The change goes hand-in-hand with one of Diablo 4's other big Season 11 changes, as the game will be removing the current Renown system that Waypoints are tied to in favor of a new Season Rank system. Many of the most important rewards from Renown, like additional skill and Paragon points, will instead be tied to completing seasonal objectives as part of Season Rank. Altars of Lilith, another aging piece of Diablo 4 that saw players exploring the map and was tied to the Renown system, are also seeing a big change. They are being reworked to no longer grant permanent stat boosts and will instead grant experience and other minor rewards when discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Other huge system reworks coming in Season 11 include significant changes to how Masterworking and Tempering gear works, adjustments to defense and healing, updates to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-monsters-are-getting-deadlier-and-smarter-in-season-11/1100-6535477/" data-ref-id="1100-6535477">monsters smarter and more deadly</a>, and the reintroduction of leaderboards in the form of a new challenge dungeon called The Tower.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11 is set to begin on December 9. Blizzard has not yet officially announced Diablo 4's second expansion, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">expected to arrive in 2026</a>, and just might introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evidence-of-a-diablo-4-paladin-class-may-have-just-leaked/1100-6533963/" data-ref-id="1100-6533963">Paladin class</a>.</p>

		<p>January is a month that most people don’t like. It is cold, dark, and wet. However, the plus side to January is that you can stay inside, get cosy, have a warm drink and relax. Coffee Beans is aiming to replicate some of that vibe with its cosy cafe sim Tailside, which has been given a release date of January 21st.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR9YeieTIj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tailside will let you design your cafe, serve drinks to customers, and follow mini storylines. There are no time pressures to adhere to so players can take things at their own pace. As you make progress, new items and drinks will be unlocked, along with new visitors to the cafe. Tailside will also have a sandbox mode allowing players to decorate the cafe however they wish. Additionally, Tailside will allow players to import their own custom characters into the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim/">A demo for Tailside</a> is currently available on Steam ahead of its January 21st release date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls 6 "Still a Long Way Off", Says Todd Howard]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-6-still-long-way-off-todd-howard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-6-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard.1349050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>director and Bethesda studio head Todd Howard has some bad news for you: the game is not launching anytime soon.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with GQ, Howard says that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>(which still doesn't have its&nbsp;<em>Morrowind&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>-style secondary title) is "still a long way off", although it is "the everyday thing" on which Bethesda is currently working.</p>

<p>Howard says that his "perfect version" of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>'s launch is that "it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear", calling the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdrop</a> a "test run" that "worked out well". It sounds like&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>may well have no fanfare at all when it does eventually release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-6-long-way-off-oblivion-remaster.jpg?itok=myWmu2Au 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-6-long-way-off-oblivion-remaster.jpg?itok=bcTz3QMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>shadowdrop like&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>?</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Howard has set expectations for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>. Back in September 2023, he said that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">would launch in "2026 or later"</a>, and that it probably wouldn't appear on the PlayStation 5. Of course, that may well have changed in the interim, given Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">new multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The last we heard of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>&nbsp;was in February this year, when Bethesda announced that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc" rel="nofollow">hold a charity auction</a> allowing the winner to create their very own character to appear in the game. We still don't know where the RPG will take place or what its story might look like.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>was originally announced all the way back in 2018. The reveal was so long ago that it predates Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-acquires-zenimax-media-for-75-billion" rel="nofollow">acquisition of Bethesda and its parent company ZeniMax</a>.</p>

<p>When the game was announced, it was through a trailer that simply showed a logo for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, along with a rural fantasy landscape. To date, that's still all we have in terms of the art direction and location for the highly-anticipated RPG.</p>




<p>It remains to be seen whether any more news on&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>will be revealed in the near future (or, indeed, throughout the rest of next year). Stay tuned for more.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Anyone that's spent any amount of time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> recently will already know that the thing the game needs right now isn't new features, its fixes. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-huge-into-the-unjust-410-update-fires-out-over-200-bug-fixes-plus-some-weapon-balancing">massive patch dropped last month bringing</a> in over 200 bug fixes (you know, the technological kind of bugs), as part of the dev team's promise to get the game in running order again. That promise even extends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">holding off on adding new stuff</a> for the time being. When it comes to new stuff, however, one thing you shouldn't expect for the time being is cross progression.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-has-no-plans-to-add-cross-progression-even-though-arrowhead-ceo-says-wed-love-to-as-other-things-take-priority/">GamesRadar</a>, when asked by a member of the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Discord server if there were any updates on cross progression, community manager Katherine Baskin had this to say: "We have no plans to add cross progression currently." That obviously kind of says it all, yet all hope on the feature is not necessarily lost.
</p>
<p>
Later on, responding to similar questions regarding cross progression, CEO Shams Jorjani explained, "[for what it's worth] we'd love to add cross platform progression, but other things take priority." There doesn't appear to be what those other things are, but we can probably assume that those aforementioned bug fixes are a part of that. Not to mention the fact that live service games are a tricky thing to balance, especially considering they essentially facilitate entire economies. Doesn't sound like an easy thing to translate across platforms.
</p>
<p>
When we may see such a thing, I can't tell you, it sounds like a while away. So, if it's that much of a problem for you, perhaps you can try out one of the million other live service games that are out there. You're spoiled for choice!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-official-20w-usb-c-charger-for-iphone-sells-for-pennies-and-it-includes-a-5-foot-cable-2000642458</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-official-20w-usb-c-charger-for-iphone-sells-for-pennies-and-it-includes-a-5-foot-cable.1349044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger costs $20 and doesn’t even include a cable, forcing iPhone buyers to pay extra just to charge their new devices at proper speeds. Anker has positioned itself as one of the few third-party brands sold directly in Apple Stores and it earned Apple’s stamp of approval for quality and compatibility.</p>
<p>The good news is that right now, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two-pack of Anker 20W chargers currently sells for just $15 on Amazon, down from the standard $18 price</a>, and each unit includes a 5-foot USB-C cable. You’re essentially <strong>getting two complete charging solutions</strong> with cables for less than the cost of Apple’s single charger alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Anker Earned Apple’s Trust and Your Money</h2>
<p>The <strong>20W output provides the fastest charging speed currently supported by iPhones</strong> which brings an empty device to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes. That’s really fast and something important for those rushed mornings when you forgot to charge overnight or need to top up before going out in the evening. Power Delivery ensures compatibility across the entire iPhone lineup from the iPhone 8 forward and it will work seamlessly with iPads that support fast charging, AirPods cases, and various other USB-C devices.</p>



<p>But that’s not all: the <strong>dual-port design on each charger</strong> brings with it some unexpected versatility that Apple’s single-port adapter simply can’t match. You <strong>get both a USB-C port and a USB-A port on each unit</strong>, and lets you charge two devices at the same time without needing multiple wall outlets. If you’re using the USB-C alone, it’ll continue to pump out the full 20W while the USB-A adds additional charging capability for any older devices or accessories that haven’t yet made the switch to USB-C.</p>



<p>That compact form factor makes these chargers truly portable without the bulk that seems to afflict too many high-wattage adapters. The<strong> foldable prongs on the US version fold flat against the body</strong> so the sharp metal pins won’t catch on clothes or scratch other items in your bag. The size is small enough to fit in crowded power strips without blocking the adjacent outlets, which addresses one of the most annoying things about big charging bricks: they tend to monopolize multiple spaces.</p>
<p>The<strong> included 5-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> provide you with enough length to comfortably use your phone as it charges, even when the outlet is located inconveniently. Apple’s own cables are only 3 feet, which in turn makes you sit strangely close to wall outlets or sacrifice active use of your phone during charging. The extra two feet of cable length completely alters charging from a restrictive tether into something that allows natural movement and comfortable usage of the device.</p>
<p>For $15 for two charging solutions with cables included, this <strong>Anker pack is 75% less than buying two of Apple’s official chargers</strong> that would run you $40 plus the additional cost of cables.</p>

<p>Activision is getting ready to launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14. With that preparation comes an update to the Call of Duty app on various platforms, and one platform needing the update is PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app on PS5 requires around 100GB to install. This update includes Multiplayer and Zombies while a separate Campaign pack is needed for that section of the game. And while that should be it to get ready to playing Black Ops 7, if you still want to play either Black Ops 6 or Warzone, you’re going to have to do more after the updating the HQ app.</p>



<p>After the new update, you’re going to be <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1987931198442643822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">required to reinstall</a> both the Black Ops 6 and Warzone packs if you want to keep playing those games and their modes. It’s an extra step and more time to play the games that were already previously installed. And, because the app update is mandatory for everyone, there’s seemingly no way around it on PS5.</p>



<p>Are you going to reinstall Warzone or Black Ops 6 to keep playing on your PS5 after the Call of Duty app update, or are you just going to wait now for Black Ops 7?

                <p>While From Software may be turning some of its heads toward <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-duskbloods/">The Duskbloods</a>, the whole team isn't done with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> yet, as the Japanese developer is working on DLC for the rougelike/souls-like that’s apparently slated to launch by the end of March 2026.</p><p>According to a second-quarter earnings report, parent company Kadokawa revealed that Elden Ring Nightreign "performed well beyond initial expectations." The goal for the Japanese publishing conglomerate is for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign, and its DLC to reach "further sales growth." To achieve this, the company said From Software has "multiple game titles in the development pipeline, both for consoles and mobile platforms."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> I Was Wrong About Elden Ring: Nightreign...</p>
      </div>
<p>"From Software is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025), Elden Ring Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," Kadokawa said in the report, which was released on November 6. "A mobile game for [the supernatural mystery monga] Oshi no Ko is under development (distribution is planned to begin in 2026)."</p><p>Fiscal years are broken into three-month quarters. "FY2025" normally means the end of the 2025 fiscal year, which is September 30 in the US. But because From Software and Kadokawa are Japanese companies, fiscal years are different there, with "FY2025" pointing to March 31, 2026; this is the end of the 2025 fiscal year for Japan. Not to spell it all the way out, but this suggests that Nightreign DLC should come out before March wraps. Everything is tentative, though, and until From Software announces it, take all of this with a grain of salt.</p><p>Still, this could be good news for a Nightreign community that’s been clamoring for DLC since the game's Deep of Night mode, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/">made the rougelike/souls-like way harder</a> than it already was. Despite being well received by critics and fans after its May 30 launch, Nightreign has slipped to a "mostly positive" Steam rating, with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raventg/recommended/3515610/">a handful</a> of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/katarinabluu/recommended/3515610/">recent negative reviews</a> criticizing From Software for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CAXX/recommended/3515610/">the lack of add-on content</a> to the game.</p><p>Elden Ring's Nintendo Switch 2 port was moved out of 2025 to a nebulous 2026 window due to "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/">performance adjustments</a>," with From Software wanting to polish this version as much as possible. Meanwhile, The Duskbloods, a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-create-your-own-character-in-the-duskbloods-but-you-can-customize-one/1100-6530631/" data-ref-id="1100-6530631">appears to be a slight departure</a> for the notoriously single-player-focused studio, but don't worry: From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">the team isn't abandoning what it's best known for</a>; it's just experimenting right now.</p><p>As such, the Japanese studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-unannounced-from-software-game-will-reportedly-be-coming-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6533277/" data-ref-id="1100-6533277">reportedly has a multiplatform title</a> that's so far in production it could release next year. From Software seems very busy.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/following-firings-and-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-plans-to-keep-pressure-on-rockstar.1349029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>At the end of October, Rockstar abruptly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?ref=aftermath.site"><u>fired over 30 workers</u></a> in what Independent Workers’ Union Of Great Britain (IWGB) – the games-focused branch of which was helping the workers organize – called "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry.” Since then, Rockstar has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?ref=aftermath.site"><u>claimed</u></a> that workers were “discussing confidential information in a public forum,” but IWGB has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum?ref=aftermath.site"><u>countered</u></a> by saying that the alleged public forum was a private union Discord, and the only other people in it were union organizers. Last week, workers, organizers, and those sympathetic to their cause convened outside publisher Take-Two’s offices in London and Rockstar’s offices in Edinburgh, Scotland <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-employment-protests-outside-take-two-and-rockstar-north-offices-as-fired-staff-deny-leaking-company-secrets?ref=aftermath.site"><u>to protest</u></a>. As long as Rockstar refuses to reinstate those affected, the IWGB Game Workers Union says there’s more where that came from.</p><p>"We believe the [firings] were unlawful and retaliatory – connected to the workers' collective activity of organizing at Rockstar," IWGB Game Workers Union co-founder Austin Kelmore told Aftermath. "This action by Rockstar came shortly after reaching 10 percent of eligible workers at Rockstar in the union. … IWGB intends to pursue every legal avenue available to ensure the members are reinstated and receive interim relief effectively.”</p><p>On the same day as last week’s protests, Rockstar announced that it was <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-postponed-again-to-november-2026?ref=aftermath.site"><u>delaying <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></u></a> from May 2026 to November 2026, which followed an original release date of fall 2025. Publisher Take-Two attributed the latest delay to a decision to give the “team some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve.” The announcement came as part of the company’s quarterly results, not an uncommon time for this kind of news, but firing over 30 workers in what was supposed to be the final stretch of development certainly won’t help the game get over the finish line.</p><p>"[The Friday before last], and then [last] week as well, some of the workers have stood outside of Rockstar North in Edinburgh with a big banner of IWGB Game Workers, and a bunch of their coworkers have come out,” said Kelmore. “I went on Monday and went to the office, and coworkers were coming out and talking about just how much they valued the people who were fired and how integral they were to their teams. Some people who have been fired had been there for years and years and years. [With] the knowledge they accumulated, people were like 'We don't know what we're going to do now.'"</p><figure><figcaption><span>IWGB</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar, for its part, has reason to be squeamish about <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> leaks, following <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/09/21/grand-theft-auto-vi-leak-rockstar-rumors-youtubers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a massive leak</u></a> of a much-earlier-in-development version of the game back in 2022. But Kelmore, the IWGB, and fired workers don’t believe that’s the central matter at hand in this case.</p><p>"I was dismissed without warning, without evidence, and without a chance to speak for myself – all because I talked with colleagues in a private union chat,” said <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1986405925976940722?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement from a fired Rockstar worker</u></a> relayed to the crowd during the London protest. “We weren’t leaking anything or trying to harm the company. We were supporting each other, trying to understand our workplace and make it better. To lose my job for that is deeply unfair. No one should be punished for being part of a union or for speaking honestly about their work.”&nbsp;</p><p>The protests drew large crowds of game developers and other allies – including <a href="https://x.com/Ross_Greer/status/1986433987791729139?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a contingent from Scotland’s green party</u></a> – and fired Rockstar workers were encouraged by the turnout.</p><p>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account,” a worker who was granted anonymity out of concern over ongoing negotiations said in a statement to Aftermath. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</p><p>“Rockstar has produced some of the most profitable products in the history of entertainment media, and it is the workers who have written, coded, and developed those games who are responsible for that," Patrick Harvie, a member of the Scottish Parliament, said in a statement to Aftermath. "It is the workers who make these games so profitable and legendary amongst the gaming community. Yet, the company has sacked dozens of them for simply exercising their right to unionise and demand better terms and conditions in their workplace, and Scottish Greens are proud to stand alongside those workers in Edinburgh."</p><p>This is not the first time in recent history – never mind the reports of <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466?ref=aftermath.site"><u>crunch on <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> and other projects</u></a> from 2018 – that Rockstar has shown disregard for workers, nor that workers have organized to push back. Last year, IWGB and Rockstar workers <a href="https://aftermath.site/rockstar-return-to-office-grand-theft-auto-vi-crunch"><u>voiced concern to Aftermath</u></a> about a mandatory five-day-a-week return-to-office policy that they feared would lead to crunch and a loss of key employees, especially among those with disabilities. At the time, employees said Rockstar also used security to justify that decision, which similarly just so happened to confer greater control over the labor force. Back then as well, workers felt that the cost of losing staff outweighed any benefits Rockstar’s new edict could provide.</p><p>"Having people who've been through [the end game of a project before], who know what to do in that situation and know what's the best decision to make to solve a problem, is better than having people who haven't had that experience – who might make mistakes they otherwise wouldn't if there wasn't this pressure,” a Rockstar employee who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly told Aftermath last year. “Losing key people in teams would be very, very bad."</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A dismissed employee at Rockstar reads a statement: <a href="https://t.co/wkIDU28NRJ?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/wkIDU28NRJ</a></p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1986405925976940722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Now, following the 2025 firings, IWGB believes that Rockstar workers were unfairly dismissed and hopes to get them reinstated while they go through the UK and Scotland’s employment tribunals, which are specialized courts that handle labor disputes. Regardless of the outcome, IWGB at least hopes to get workers paid for the tribunal process’ duration. In the meantime and throughout, IWGB also plans to provide workers with financial support and a figurative megaphone with which to make noise.</p><p>"The main thing is taking care of the workers in the short term and making sure that they've got the support they need both from the emotional standpoint of [the fact that] they were hit with something that is dramatically changing their lives and also financial support, whatever that might look like,” said Kelmore. “As for how long [tribunals] take, they can take quite a while, which is why we're trying to apply additional pressure with protests, and the workers are making themselves visible outside of offices and not just going away. We want Rockstar to know that this is not something that we're going to take lightly."</p><p>This marks a change in strategy for the IWGB Game Workers Union, which was founded in 2018 and has been organizing UK game workers behind the scenes ever since. As of now it boasts over 1,500 members, but it has mostly kept its specific efforts on the down low so as not to blow up workers’ spots. Earlier this year, IWGB’s labor bore fruit in the form of the UK industry's "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-devs-at-zaum-form-the-uk-industrys-first-recognised-videogame-union?ref=aftermath.site"><u>first recognized video game workplace union</u></a>" at <em>Disco Elysium</em> studio ZA/UM.</p><p>Now, as IWGB and fired workers go on the offensive against Rockstar, Kelmore believes the Game Workers Union is entering a new phase of its relatively young life.&nbsp;</p><p>"Prior to this happening, we haven't ever really had people standing outside of companies with IWGB banners and organizing in a very visible way,” he said. “But this has changed that. When companies do something like this, you can't just slink away and hide anymore. It's a very public thing. It helps give people confidence that they can stay, because they have nothing to lose. They've already been fired. So they can be very public and organize and fight back. I think we are slowly starting to go over the curve of completely hidden to more public actions, and I anticipate more of these in the near future, too."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware's parent company, Kadokawa, has <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/information/">published its earnings results</a> for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, and included in the results is the company's take on the performance of Elden Ring Nightreign, and some insight into future plans for the spin-off title.</p>



<p>We know that Elden Ring Nightreign was one of this year's hit titles because not too long after its launch in May 2025, FromSoftware confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">Nightreign had surpassed 5 million copies sold</a>. That's absolutely nothing to scoff at, especially for a multiplayer spin-off title that could have just as easily gone the other way, since many of the people who play FromSoftware games do so for their single-player games.</p>



<p>Now, we know directly from Kadokawa that Elden Ring Nightreign "<em>performed well beyond initial expectations</em>," the company writes in its earnings results. That said, Kadokawa's overall sales from its gaming division decreased compared to last year. As strong as Elden Ring Nightreign's sales were, they were not strong enough to surpass the impact that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree had last year.</p>



<p>"<em>In Gaming, sales decreased despite the domestic and international strong performance of Elden Ring Nightreign, compared to the previous year, which benefited significantly from the contributions of the Elden Ring DLC</em>," writes Kadokawa.</p>



<p>On the slide specifically going over its Gaming segment, under the 'Future Outlook' section, Kadokawa confirms that "<em>FromSoftware is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025)</em>."</p>



<p>It's great to have confirmation that new DLC is in the works. Since Nightreign's launch in May, we've had updates that added <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-tsunami-warning-earthquake/">a new Duos mode to the game</a>, new, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-has-just-become-more-challenging-with-the-introduction-of-the-everdark-sovereigns/">more challenging boss fights,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-mode-out-now/">a whole new difficulty tier</a>, making the game even more difficult if you wanted to increase the challenge further.</p>



<p>However, beyond that, to say its post-launch support has trickled out slowly would be an understatement to several players, many of whom have taken to the game's Steam page to leave negative reviews, specifically citing a lack of post-launch support. </p>



<p>One player who has a little over 166 hours recorded in Nightreign <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198822376274/recommended/2622380/">left a negative review on Steam</a>, writing, "<em>I am a long time FromSoftware fan and I genuinely love Elden Ring Nightreign, but the state of this game is a joke. The post launch support is practically nonexistent. It has been months since release and we got no new boss, no new map, no new characters, no events, nothing. For a game of this scale, that is embarrassing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>My girlfriend and I put many hours into this game at first, but once we finished it there was absolutely no reason to return. The game feels abandoned and the players who supported it from day one are being ignored. The developers need to wake up. If this is the level of effort Nightreign is getting, I truly fear for the future of Duskbloods. At this rate, why should anyone trust or invest in those projects</em>."</p>



<p>With a release window of 'sometime before the end of FY2025' for new Nightreign DLC, though it's good to know that it is on the way, that could mean it doesn't arrive until March 2026, which could very well be too little too late for players like the Steam reviewer above and others.</p>



<p>Of course, we could see the DLC release before the end of this year, which could change things around for Nightreign. If it is set to arrive before the end of 2025, then we might even see it at <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">Sony's State of Play Japan event tomorrow</a>. Otherwise, hopefully, we aren't waiting too long for more Nightreign DLC.</p>

<p>Modder Halk Hogan, the creator of the project, detailed the extensive list of changes: <em>"You can expect a huge number of improvements in the upcoming HDRP version. Many things that were previously untouched or were just of lower quality will now be significantly better and will complement the beautiful world of The Witcher 3! A lot of additional objects and surfaces will no longer be flat and will receive 3D depth, many textures will be of even better quality, and also various monsters and more animals will be finally reworked."</em></p>

<p>The HD Reworked Project is one of the most impressive texture overhaul mods ever released for the game developed by CD Projekt Red. Over the years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-12-0-ultimate-to-release-on-september-19th/">the project has enhanced the vast majority of the game's textures</a>, improving visuals considerably, especially at high resolutions such as 1440p and 4K on PC.</p>



<p>The quality of work produced by Halk Hogan was deemed so impressive that an older version created for the original 2015 game was officially implemented in the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-looks-amazing-on-pc-when-it-works/">Next-Gen update</a>, allowing console users on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S to enjoy the visual overhaul that PC players had experienced for years.</p>



<p>Still, the official implementation wasn't enough for Halk Hogan, who returned to the project following the Next Gen release to provide even better textures to a game whose visuals continue to shine nearly 10 years after its original launch.</p>
