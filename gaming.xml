		<p>Bethesda’s bringing some goodies to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, following up on announcements last year with release dates and a shadow drop. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-4">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> is out this month on 24th February, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s</a> ambitious Switch 2 port will arrive in on 12th May, and it’s also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> will arrive on Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="These Bethesda Softworks games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-M-B7X_E2R0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fallout 4’s port to Nintendo Switch 2 ought to be the more straightforward one. Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition is an upgraded bundle of the decade old RPG, combining the base game with all its official add-ons and a curated set of 150 Creation Club game mods. This is a feature match for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-for-its-10th-birthday/">the PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC version that launched last year</a>.</p>
<p>While the mods will add a heftier burden to the game’s visuals (and Bethesda aren’t exactly known for the optimisation of their RPGs), we’d hope that they strike a good balance with Fallout 4. Certainly, it needs to be better than the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-switch-2-review/">Switch 2 launch of Skyrim</a>, which had bags of added latency that needed hurried patches to take the worst off.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, though, is much more ambitious. Originally released for Xbox Series X|S and PC in December 2024, before being ported to PS5 last April, it’s a current gen game that features ray traced global illumination for its light and shadow throughout. The Switch 2 hardware does support ray tracing, but its GPU comes in shy of the minimum bar that MachineGames set for the game on PC or Series S. That said, idTech is often fantastically well-optimised for all manner of system specs, so hopefully they can sprinkle some magic dust on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now across Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PlayStation 5. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review of the main game</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

		<p>Capcom games were sprinkled through the Nintendo Direct today, the company has announced that demoes for two of their upcoming games will drop onto Nintendo Switch 2 today. If you’re curious to see what Pragmata and Monster Hunter Stories 3 are like, then you can grab a demo and find out!</p>
<p>It’s also been confirmed that the <a href="https://xcancel.com/PRAGMATAgame/status/2019416240972779807#m">Pragmata</a> demo is available across all its launch platforms, so Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and (already) PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection – Demo Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2paOXQxE3dc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We’ve been hands on with both, starting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-stories-3">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-takes-the-series-mythology-in-a-new-and-exciting-direction/">Dom was able to check out last year</a>. He said, “Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is the obvious next step for the series. That’s taking the graphics and the turn-based action up a notch, while expanding the world of Monster Hunter into newfound territory. The previous two games have given fans a totally different take on the mythology and magic of the series’ iconic creatures, and on early impressions alone, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection looks as though it’s going to carry on that tradition.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> at a Nintendo preview event last week, coming away pretty happy with how the game’s inventive sci-fi puzzle action handled on the console. I’ve written, “Darkness hides a lot of necessary evils in Resident Evil Requiem, but playing through the Sketchbook demo on Switch 2 places Hugh and Diana in a very brightly lit, clean environment, and that doesn’t help matters. There’s maybe some fuzzy upscaling that’s noticeable, there’s 3D model detail that’s reduced far enough to be reminiscent of the moulded look that PS3 era normal mapping presented, and the like. The visual cuts were pretty clear to me when playing on TV, but hopping into the game in handheld mode helped to max them a bit more, and the game was still nice and smooth to play in both settings.”</p>

<p>Rounding out the previews for Capcom, there was a new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem, showcasing both Grace and Leon gameplay, as well as reconfirming that it will launch alongside ports of Resident Evil 7 and Village on 27th February.</p>

<p>The Great Circle awaits</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Looking forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on the Switch 2? Well, good news, because it's finally emerging on 12th May 2026.</p>
<p>Developed by MachineGames of Wolfenstein fame, The Great Circle sees Indy embark on an epic adventure that takes him across Vatican City, Giza, the Himalaya Mountains, and more. Blending first-person action with some neat stealth elements, it's a genuinely great game, and we sincerely hope it translates well to the Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 This June]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After it was rumoured to appear during today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>, once the showcase started, it didn't take too long for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> to appear, with a new trailer showcasing the second entry in the FFVII Remake Trilogy on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, and a release date, with it arriving almost precisely as predicted: on <strong>June 3, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the reliable insider NateTheHate pointed to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/">arriving on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S sometime this year</a>. Following that, yesterday, ahead of today's Partner Showcase, NateTheHate pointed to Rebirth appearing at today's showcase, as it supported a theory they have regarding how <strong>Square Enix</strong> will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">begin its marketing campaign for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Well, NateTheHate was absolutely right about everything so far. Not only did Rebirth appear during the Partner Showcase, but it was also given a release date, which, as he predicted, falls in June, in close proximity to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest.</a></strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 2.5.2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08qdAc3jh8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>For Final Fantasy fans who only have a Nintendo Switch 2 available to them and haven't been able to play any of the games in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy so far, this is great news. Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong> is on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, those players can look forward to jumping into Rebirth when it arrives on Switch 2 this June.</p>



<p>For all other Final Fantasy fans that have already rinsed Remake Intergrade and Rebirth on other platforms, this hopefully means that NateTheHate is also correct about his prediction that, at Summer Game Fest 2026, we'll get our first look at the conclusion of the remake trilogy, which will also hopefully be a multiplatform release.</p>



<p>Speaking of other platforms, the only thing left unclear at the time of this writing is the arrival of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Xbox Series X/S. Presumably, it'll arrive on June 3, 2026, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, just like how Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade arrived on both Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S at the same time. For now, Rebirth's Xbox Series release date has yet to be confirmed. We'll update this article when that information goes live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Saw At Today’s Nintendo Partner Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999</link>
            <guid>1426696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s February. The weather is cold, love is in the air, and there’s a Nintendo Direct to tune in for. Nintendo, as it often does, scheduled it for the ass crack of dawn, so if you were still sleeping or getting ready for work and missed the whole shebang, we’ve got you covered. If you want to watch the stream yourself, you can do so below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p>  <h2><em>Orbitals</em></h2> <p>Kicking things off is <em>Orbitals</em>, a game often described as “anime&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.” The co-op puzzle game sports a retro anime aesthetic and has two players doing co-op-centric puzzles, platforming, and a ton of mini-games. It’s coming to Switch 2 this summer and will support Game Share, so you’ll only need one copy of the game to play with a friend.</p>

  <h2><em>Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse</em></h2> <p>Next up is the next entry in the&nbsp;<em>Paranormasight&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp; The mystery adventure series is going to an island setting where you’ll solve puzzles and a larger mystery. It’s coming out on February 19.</p>  <h2><em>Captain Tsubasa II World Fighters</em></h2> <p>If you’ve ever wanted to live out a sports anime, the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Captain Tsubasa&nbsp;</em>series is giving you that chance with its extreme soccer action. It’s coming to Switch later this year.</p>

  <h2><em>Tokyo Scramble</em></h2> <p><em>Tokyo Scramble&nbsp;</em>is a horror game in which you run around a subterranean world beneath Tokyo while trying to avoid dinosaurs, sometimes activating traps to hinder them. You can play alongside friends by splitting the game’s controls across multiple systems such that one person controls character movement, another steers the camera, and so on. That sounds…frustrating but in a way that would probably make for a good livestream. It’s coming to Switch 2 February 11.</p>

  <h2><em>Valheim</em></h2> <p>Survival game&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 after being just about everywhere else for years. It’ll arrive on the system later this year.</p>  <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Switch 2 Edition</em></h2> <p>If you want to play the original <em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>on the go with better framerate, it’s coming to Switch 2 today. If you have the Switch version, you can upgrade for free.</p>

  <h2><em>eFootball Kick-Off!</em></h2> <p>And we’re back to soccer with&nbsp;<em>eFootball Kick-Off!</em>, Konami’s evolution of its legendary <em>PES </em>soccer series, which is coming to Switch 2 this summer.</p>  <h2><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em></h2> <p><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales </em>is the next HD-2D RPG coming from Square, and it looks pretty despite the silly name. It’s coming to Switch 2 on June 18.</p>  <h2><em>Super Bomberman Collection</em></h2> <p>If you’re feeling nostalgic and want to play all five <em>Bomberman</em> games released on the SNES, including ones that weren’t released worldwide up until now, the <em>Super Bomberman Collection&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 today.</p>

  <h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></h2> <p>The second game in the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake&nbsp;</em>trilogy is coming to Switch 2, so you, too, can play a whole bunch of mini-games and be annoyed by the ending on the go. It’s coming to Switch 2 on June 3.</p>  <h2><em>Pragmata</em></h2> <p>Capcom’s new sci-fi puzzle shooter&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2, and what I played of it last year makes it seem like it’s going to be pretty cool in a kind of nostalgic Xbox-360-era shooter sort of way. It’s coming to Switch 2 on April 24, and a demo is available today.</p>

  <h2><em>Turok: Origins</em></h2> <p>If one dinosaur game was not enough for you or you want one that’s gonna be a bit more action and a bit less running away, <em>Turok: Origins&nbsp;</em>is bringing all that to Switch 2 in the fall.</p>  <h2><em>Kyoto Xanadu</em></h2> <p><i>Kyoto Xanadu&nbsp;</i>is a cross between hack-and-slash and sidescrolling action and&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-style social sim. It’s coming to Switch and Switch 2 this summer.</p>  <h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></h2> <p>Oh hell yeah,&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 and Switch. It’s a great turn-based RPG that I probably would’ve preferred playing on this system the first time around. It’s coming to Nintendo systems on July 10.</p>

  <h2><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</em></h2> <p>The latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy&nbsp;</em>action RPG series is coming to the Switch 2 on July 9.</p>  <h2><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em></h2> <p>If you’ve ever been interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em> but find its dense systems intimidating, the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> subseries is probably a better entry point. The next entry,&nbsp;<em>Twisted Reflection</em>, is coming to Switch 2 on March 13, and a demo is coming out today. If you play it, you can transfer your save data to the full game when it launches.</p>  <h2>Arcade Archives&nbsp;/&nbsp;Console Archives</h2> <p>New games are coming to Arcade Archives and Console Archives, including&nbsp;<em>Rave Racer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Doraemon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Wings Special</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cool Boarders</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos.&nbsp;</em></p>  <h2>Montage</h2> <p>Next up we got some rapid-fire trailers for games like <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> (March 3),&nbsp;<em>Another Eden Begins&nbsp;</em>(Summer 2026),&nbsp;<em>Reanimal&nbsp;</em>(February 13),&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K26&nbsp;</em>(March 13),&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown&nbsp;</em>(February 18),&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> (Switch 2 Edition) (March 25), <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> (February 6),&nbsp;<em>Culdcept Begins&nbsp;</em>(July 16),&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator 3</em> (April 1),&nbsp;<em>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun&nbsp;</em>(March 18), and <em>Tales of Arise – Beyond the Dawn Edition</em> (May 22).</p>

  <h2><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h2> <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>is launching on Switch 2 alongside all other current systems on February 27. Folks who have played the game on the console have said it runs pretty well, though it doesn’t look quite as good, so it’s, ya know, a Switch version of a game. <em>Resident Evil VII&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>will also launch on the Switch 2 that same day. Amiibos of Grace and Leon are coming out this summer and will unlock weapon skins in <em>Requiem</em>.</p>  <h2>Bethesda is bringing games to Switch 2</h2> <p>Wrapping up the show is Bethesda, which is bringing&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>on February 24,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on May 12, and&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>later in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Wastes No Time Coming To Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-switch-2-release-date-trailer-rpg-2000666014</link>
            <guid>1426690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> will come to Switch 2 just six months after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">first game in Square Enix’s remake trilogy</a> arrived on Nintendo’s portable console. It’s also getting a special “boost” mode to help streamline combat.</p> <p>Out on Switch 2 on June 6, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> follows Cloud and co. after they leave the first game’s Blade Runner-infused megacity of Midgar and head out on an open-world-ish adventure to find Sephiroth and save the world. Its peaks are higher than those of the first game but its troughs are also deeper. The big question will be how well the Switch 2 can handle its much larger environments. Valve’s Steam Deck has <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-steam-deck-verified-performance-1851748592">more than struggled</a> with the much more sprawling sequel.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the game looks in action on Switch 2:</p>  <p>The game will arrive with a new “boost” mode, which I’m guessing will come to the existing versions of the game on other platforms as well. If it’s anything like the new settings added to the Switch 2 version of <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em>, it’ll essentially be a combat god mode in which every hit does 9,999 damage and all Materia are maxed out. It’s a way to make the experience almost frictionless for people who might be intimidated by the RPG’s hybrid combat mechanics and just want to get to the next mini-game or cutscene.</p> <p>The speed at which <em>Rebirth</em> is coming to Switch 2 is the real surprise here. While we’ll have to wait to see just how much it tests Nintendo’s new hardware, the move certainly lends more credence to the possibility <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075">that the third game</a> in the remake trilogy, which is reportedly playable and almost finished, won’t be a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive like the others. Hopefully for Switch 2 and Xbox owners, the next game comes to every platform day-and-date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Fans Debate Game’s ‘Death’ From ‘Streamer Influence’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-streamers-death-of-game/</link>
            <guid>1426687</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders was released at the end of October, emerging into a blossoming extraction shooter space and making immense waves. It quickly became one of the most successful games of 2025, smashing sales expectations and topping charts worldwide, both in terms of players and <strong>viewers</strong>.</p>



<p>However, that latter aspect has surfaced in a nasty way in recent days. On social media, the concept of <strong>streamers ruining ARC Raiders </strong>has gained traction from a debate perspective. Many feel that Embark Studios could be listening too much to streamers, a concern that could lead to the game’s ‘death’.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-streamers-ruin-arc-raiders">Will Streamers Ruin ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>In the weeks that followed the launch of ARC Raiders, we saw countless content creators leap head over heels into the game. It made sense, as it was a game that made for excellent content, and for a while, it was one of the most-watched games on Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>It even spawned a creator-backed ‘war’ between the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">Hutch and TheBurntPeanut</a>, which was fun for all of about five minutes.</p>



<p>Now, a comment that surfaced on social media has spawned a somewhat virulent debate, suggesting that ‘try hard, super f***ing losers’ that populate streaming and social spaces will bring about the death of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter (now X), <a href="https://x.com/TheTopGEight/status/2019239505971278265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ghost of Eight wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of duty died because they listened to the streamers. H1Z1 died because they tried to make it competitive. Arc Raiders is going to die if they listen to the streamers. Gaming is dead because of streamers and developers listening to social media, which is mostly filled with try hard, super f***ing losers</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post quickly gained traction, racking up hundreds of thousands of impressions and stacks of comments from the community. In one comment, a user stood on the side of the developer, admitting that ‘streamers are the loudest voices in the room, so devs think they represent the majority.’</p>



<p>In another comment, a user bagged on streamers and their fickle, collective mentality: ‘The same streamers that immediately go and play whatever new game is out. These clowns have zero loyalty.’</p>



<p>In recent weeks, ARC Raiders has suffered under the weight of exploits, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/">cheaters</a>, and a slow update cadence that is rewarding players with <strong>one new map in five months</strong>. Most of the complaints regarding all this come from the streamers that generate audiences in the tens of thousands while playing ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>As another user wrote under Ghost of Eight’s comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I agree. Streamers cry to change things like it’s their own personal playground.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Far too often, we see the power of streamers, as one thing commented on by the likes of shroud brings about a major change in a game. Admittedly, it can sometimes be for the better, but the examples are few and far between.</p>







<p>It’s the PvE vs PvP debate all over again. Do you think streamers are ruining ARC Raiders? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

During the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, the final game announced was Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, which will be coming to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It was featured at the end of a sizzle reel highlighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda </a>games coming to the platform.</p>



<p>Unlike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/fallout-4-anniversary-edition/" id="154845">Fallout 4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" id="54815">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, this game was not given a proper release date. Instead, it was simply noted that it will be released in 2026.</p>

Even if that isn't an <em>official </em>feature (and will probably result in you damaging your Switch 2, so please don't try it), the ability to play Fallout 4 on the go through your Nintendo Switch 2 is an exciting proposition, and we'll be able to do just that when Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition arrives on February 24.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2026/02/05/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-emerges-on-switch-2-this-month]]></content:encoded>

It's a good day for those those interests lie at the intersection of 'spooky' and 'deduction' - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s acclaimed visual novel Paranormasight is officially getting a sequel and it's coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> later this month, on 19th February.
</p>
<p>
The original Paranormasight, subtitled The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, launched back in 2023, offering an engaging, intriguing blend of spooks and investigatory adventure, all tied to a story of dark rituals and murder in Tokyo, Japan. "Paranormasight is a delight," reckoned Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-review-spooky-goings-on-in-tokyo">review</a>. "A mystery, a puzzle, and a ghost story that's genuinely haunted by the player on the other side of the screen."

<p>
So news of a sequel is exciting indeed, and Square Enix has now shared early details as part of Nintendo's latest Partner Direct. Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, as it's known, whisks players to coastal Japan, introducing them to a young pearl diver called Yuza Minakuchi who, while diving one day, encounters another version of himself at the bottom of the ocean.
</p>
<p>But soon, other mysteries begin to plague the island's inhabitants, and - as the adventure unfolds - you'll talk to them, and explore the bay's depths, to uncover the truth of the Mermaid's Curse.
</p>
<p>
So there you go. That's Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, coming to Switch 2 on 19th February.

		<p>Square Enix has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 3rd June 2026, arriving just half a year after the port of the opening entry in the trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH – Coming June 3rd (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKTuMgINNg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally released as a PlayStation 5 exclusive in 2024, it’s great to see Square Enix moving so quickly to bring the middle entry to more platforms.</p>
<p>Looking back on our review at the time, Nic said, “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love. It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>
<p>We have high hopes of how this game will perform. In our review of the first port, Dom said, “The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade arrives in stunning form, with very few compromises made bringing it across to Nintendo’s newest hardware. It’s an essential purchase for RPG fans who haven’t had the chance to play this reimagined saga.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/orbitals-looks-like-a-90s-anime-it-takes-two-coming-exclusively-to-switch-2-this-summer/</link>
            <guid>1426603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Reappearing during the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Orbitals is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026, and it looks like an early 90s anime riff on the beloved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> style co-op adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orbitals – An intergalactic co-op adventure! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-bEqd-W8eE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The graphical style really shines through here, really capturing the look and feel of classic Japanese animation to go alongside the familiar looking split-screen co-op. The game sees explorers Maki and Omura setting out from their home to try and save it from an impending cosmic storm. They’ll be making use of separate abilities to support each others’ adventuring, using things like a grapple gun to pull out platforms, or cool lava with a water gun.</p>
<p>The game can also be played across multiple systems using GameShare, so you don’t have to play on TV or with a single Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Announced back at The Game Awards (where we sadly missed its reveal), the game is in development by Tokyo-based indie team Shapefarm, but with assistance from animation house Studio Massket to craft its cutscenes. The game will have both Japanese and English audio dubs.</p>

			<p><strong>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</strong> cloud gaming service <strong>is turning six this month</strong>. As you might recall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidias-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-is-officially-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it launched right as the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> started spreading globally in February 2020</a>. The service has undoubtedly greatly improved over the last few years, convincing more publishers to bring their games to the cloud and also continuously improving the backend technology to raise the bar for cloud gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they did a few months ago with the <strong>RTX Blackwell</strong> upgrade</a>. </p>



<p>NVIDIA took the opportunity to confirm that <strong>GFN users have streamed over one billion hours of gameplay to date</strong>. Given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing memory shortage</a>, it wouldn't be surprising to see even more gamers turning to the cloud to play on PC.</p>



<p>Anyway, to celebrate the anniversary, <strong>NVIDIA is adding 24 PC games to the supported GeForce NOW list this month</strong>, starting this week with the following titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Indika (New release on Xbox, available on Game Pass, Feb. 3)</li>



<li>Menace (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Feb. 5, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic Anniversary Edition (New release on Battle.net, Feb. 5)</li>



<li>PUBG: BLINDSPOT (New release on Steam, Feb. 5, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift (New release on Steam, Feb. 6, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>Delta Force (Steam)</li>



<li>Fallout Shelter (Steam)</li>



<li>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition (Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Roadcraft (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Epic Games Store)</li>
</ul>



<p>The best is yet to come, though, with <strong>CAPCOM's Resident Evil Requiem</strong> undoubtedly set to be the most played GeForce NOW game when it launches in late February. Here's the rest of the February 2026 list:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there were ever a sure bet in life, it's that a video game adaptation will always make someone unhappy. As it turns out, translating a game from an interactive format with no defined time constraint to a non-interactive medium with a limited view time means that some concessions need to be made. In the case of the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, there's an extra problem in that it takes place after <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-new-vegas-at-10-why-its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-strip" rel="nofollow">beloved entry in the franchise with a lot of potential player-defined endings</a>.</p><p>You obviously can't please everyone due to how each of the endings could potentially have massive in-universe consequences. Thus the billion dollar question is which ending did the <em>Fallout </em>TV show go with, or did the writers make up a new ending entirely? Perhaps the best way to answer that would be to examine the status of the Wasteland's major powers as presented by the show.</p><h2><strong>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD</strong></h2><h3><em>Fallout TV</em> | The Brotherhood of Steel</h3><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-tv-season-2-trailer-brotherhood-of-steel.jpg?itok=Cp5uNsbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>What can possibly stand against the Brotherhood of Steel now?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Brotherhood of Steel has the most screen time of any of the major factions in the <em>Fallout </em>TV show. The fact that Maximus, one of the main characters of the show, is a member of the Brotherhood means that we get a lot of insight into what the faction has been up to since the end of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Interestingly enough, the <em>Fallout </em>TV show makes a distinction between both individual Brotherhood chapters and the larger Commonwealth and West Coast divisions of the Brotherhood.</p><p>The Commonwealth Brotherhood of Steel faction is pretty much a direct continuation of the Brotherhood from <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>Fallout 4</em>. At this time, the show suggests that the writers are going with either the Minutemen or Brotherhood ending of <em>Fallout 4</em>. That being said, the <em>Fallout </em>TV show states that the Commonwealth Brotherhood is having some hard times, insinuating that their war with the Institute and possibly the Railroad expended a lot of manpower and resources.</p><p>The West Coast Brotherhood of Steel division is represented by Maximus' chapter and three other Brotherhood chapters. Interestingly enough, the <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> Brotherhood chapter is nowhere to be found. Given that the show would take place in their backyard, one would logically conclude that this particular chapter was rendered non-existent, either directly as per the game's endings or indirectly as a result of their isolation and potential hostility to most of the major players in the region.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Brotherhood of Steel as a whole, they are in the midst of a massive civil war. The West Coast chapters have already started fighting each other, and the Commonwealth-based Brotherhood would almost certainly not be happy that their representative was killed at a meeting organized by the West Coast chapters. To make matters worse, whoever comes out on top on the West Coast will control Area 51 and all of its pre-war tech, guaranteeing that this civil war will be incredibly destructive.</p><h3><em>Fallout TV</em> | The NCR</h3><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-tv-season-2-trailer-ncr.jpg?itok=ihIDDk6j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>No signs of battle and all this equipment sitting around after all this time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While the NCR has been portrayed favorably by the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, the state of the NCR in <em>New Vegas</em> is dire. Indeed, one of the major plot points of the show is that although the NCR was on a path to relative normalcy, the destruction of Shady Sands has contributed to the NCR's current diminished state.&nbsp;</p><p>The small pockets of NCR soldiers that we do see in the show are invariably under-supplied, disorganized, and isolated. Even if the show writers decided to go with the NCR ending of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, it is mostly for naught as their military has withdrawn from the New Vegas area. That the NCR's local detachment of elite Rangers have been reduced to glorified scavengers bodes poorly for a faction that, by all accounts, should have reasonably sturdy logistics and communications systems.</p><p>It should probably be noted that Freeside's inhabitants appear to be quite fond of the NCR. This all but confirms that the NCR had conquered New Vegas for a decent amount of time and then withdrew. If this is the case, then the likelihood of a Pyrrhic NCR victory at the end of <em>New Vegas </em>increases dramatically.&nbsp;</p><p>This is further reinforced by the finale as a full NCR detachment finally shows up, complete with Veteran Rangers and fresh-looking gear. The difference cannot be any more stark as this group is clearly organized and disciplined enough to reclaim Freeside without much trouble. While it remains to be seen if this is indicative of the overall status of the NCR, the fact remains that the manpower and equipment had to come from somewhere. Not to mention the time it would've taken to muster such a force and then march to Freeside.</p><h3><em>Fallout TV </em>| Caesar's Legion</h3><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-tv-season-2-trailer-legion.jpg?itok=pzRDOUb7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-tv-season-2-trailer-legion.jpg?itok=sKyvTX30 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture>
<figcaption>Kevin realized that he won't be caught home alone ever again if he invades everyone else's home first</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In a rather amusing historical parallel, Caesar's Legion is experiencing a civil war after Caesar's death. While the <em>Fallout </em>TV show doesn't specify how Caesar died, the fact that both sides of the civil war are fighting over his not so fresh corpse almost certainly means that Caesar's tumor killed him.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, Caesar's death and the subsequent civil war all but guarantees that the Legion ending of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> is not canon. In fact, it is explicitly stated that if the Legion won the battle for Hoover Dam while Caesar is dead, then Legate Lanius is crowned as the new Caesar. It makes little sense for that to change just because Caesar dies after the Legion conquers New Vegas. In fact, Lanius is never mentioned in the show at all, which would make even less sense if the Legion won.</p><p>One can go so far as to imagine a scenario where Lanius suffered a similar fate to Joshua Graham, punished for failing to conquer New Vegas and forgotten by the Legion. Otherwise you would have to explain how the Legate would allow a civil war with two self proclaimed Caesars to break out, leading to a third, completely different Caesar to be crowned and only then finally rallying the Legion to "reclaim" New Vegas.</p><h3><em>Fallout TV </em>| Mr. House and New Vegas</h3><figure role="group">

<p>The New Vegas Strip finally makes its onscreen debut, and one of the first things that Mr. House says is that things did not go according to plan. For starters, the Strip and all of its casinos are abandoned. To make matters worse, Deathclaws have moved in relatively recently and turned the area into their nest. There clearly isn't an army of upgraded Securitrons on the Strip, active or otherwise, and there didn't appear to be any signs of conflict regardless.</p><p>Freeside on the other hand appears to be thriving. Granted, <em>Fallout: New Vegas'</em> portrayal of Freeside wasn't exactly flattering, but that is more of an issue with hardware limitations than artistic intent. At the very least, it's implied that Freeside is important enough for both the NCR and Legion to have fought for control of the area, with neither side ultimately prevailing over the other before the "robots" and Deathclaws moved in next door.&nbsp;</p><p>As unfortunate as it may be that some of the Kings were Ghoulified in the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, it does shed some light upon the possible canon ending of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. The Legion endings can be ruled out as they explicitly wipe out the Kings no matter what. A Mr. House ending is an option, yet it doesn't explain why the Strip is abandoned. The Independent New Vegas scenarios match the state of Freeside better, though it must've collapsed quickly as it's explicitly stated that the NCR and Legion controlled the area long enough to implement some form of taxation.&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Fallout TV</em> | The Enclave and Vault-Tec</h3><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Look at all that beachfront property!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As one would've expected from the games, the remnants of the pre-war United States government are specters haunting the wasteland. Although the Enclave has the least amount of screen time of all the major factions, they are directly named and still active by the time of the <em>Fallout </em>TV show. To no one's surprise, the Enclave are doing evil things again and it's almost certainly leading to direct conflict in future seasons of the <em>Fallout </em>TV show.</p><p>As far as the Vaults are concerned, they have begun falling into the usual problems. Some are on the verge of running out of resources, others have collapsed due to the experiments being conducted in them, and some have (unintentionally) saved their inhabitants as advertised. Unfortunately for the show's named Vault dwellers, FEV is really being pushed to the forefront this season and we all know how much Vault-Tec loves to store bio-hazardous material in a safe and secure location.</p><hr><h2>Which <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> Ending Is Canon?</h2><p>The writers for <em>Fallout </em>TV's season 2 may not have explicitly chosen any particular <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>ending to make canon, but there's just enough clues to glean out two possible scenarios. The first possibility is that the writers went with the NCR ending. However, the NCR couldn't maintain control over the area and the destruction of Shady Sands prompted their withdrawal from New Vegas. The other likely scenario is that New Vegas won their independence for a while. Yet a handful of Securitrons can only do so much when a city is caught between two competing nation states.</p><p>While this is a rather nihilistic viewpoint, it's not entirely unrealistic. <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> itself points out that the Courier is not able to fix the wasteland on their own. It doesn't matter if you have the perfect playthrough, you're not solving the NCR's institutional rot. There's nothing preventing an independent New Vegas from falling into anarchy once the credits roll either. Even in the event that Mr. House or the Legion won, the Courier is still treated as a useful pawn, nothing more.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>It's a not so subtle rebuke of the great man theory, though that still doesn't explain why every major faction imploded at the same time. The simplest answer might be that Bethesda wants to avoid a scenario where any game's ending could snowball into the creation of a wasteland superpower.&nbsp;</p><p>We can already see hints of this with the Commonwealth Brotherhood of Steel. They went from being the savior of the Capital Wasteland in <em>Fallout 3 </em>to potentially the dominant East coast faction. According to the TV show, the Commonwealth Brotherhood now has credible force projection capabilities that can reach the West Coast as well. At that point, you'd be hard pressed to ignore them in the narrative of future games, especially if old world technology is involved.</p><p>With that in mind, perhaps the show is leveling the playing field in preparation for <em>Fallout 5</em>. Bethesda might have decided that they want to explore all of the United States in the next <em>Fallout </em>game, so it would be helpful if there wasn't one overwhelmingly powerful faction outside of the Enclave. If anything, the <em>Fallout </em>TV show's finale has more or less set up the perfect background for <em>Fallout 5 </em>(whenever that releases). You've got a coast-to-coast Brotherhood of Steel civil war, a resurgent NCR and Legion fighting over New Vegas again, the Enclave, and Mr. House all on the board as potential questlines that probably won't be fully resolved by the TV show.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><span>Developer Build a Rocket Boy might be trying to stage a </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky</span></i><span>-level comeback story for its heavily maligned, frequently mocked 2025 open-world game </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, and it would appear that the developer is attempting to do so without the help of its original publisher, IO Interactive.</span></p> <p><span>This week, </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>received an unexpected new update. Build a Rocket Boy </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/511856483278782537"><span>touts Update 7</span></a><span> as “another step forward in overall polish, guided by player and community feedback.” That statement does line up with the contents of the patch itself, as Update 7 essentially amounts to a list of bug fixes.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the patch notes were followed up by a much grander statement in an official press release. According to Build a Rocket Boy, Update 7 serves “as a reset for the brand and the title” and the beginning of a “new era” for </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>. This statement lines up with the omission of IO Interactive’s branding and copyright info in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM9gc4dauyM"><span>latest trailer</span></a><span> for the game, which seemingly proves that the leak detailing Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive’s split was correct.</span></p>  <p><span>It’s not been a great week, month, or year for </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>. At the end of January, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-mission-mindseye-build-rocket-io-interactive-2000664566"><span>it leaked</span></a><span> that Build a Rocket Boy would reportedly be parting ways with IO Interactive, ending any plans for </span><i><span>MindsEye’s </span></i><span>future </span><i><span>Hitman </span></i><span>crossover. On February 2, co-CEO Mark Gerhard </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>threatened a YouTuber</span></a><span> with a “formal cease and desist demand” via Discord 18 minutes after said YouTuber released a video titled “Leslie Benzies is in the Epstein Files.” Then, yesterday, Build a Rocket Boy’s other CEO, the aforementioned Leslie Benzies, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340"><span>released a statement</span></a><span> denying allegations of sexual assault by an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein.</span></p>

 <p><span>Build a Rocket Boy confirmed that Benzies remains working at the studio despite a wave of layoffs last summer, suggesting MindsEye’s attempt at a reboot will happen under his oversight. This week’s tease promised that a “new expansion that adds end-game content and enhanced world exploration” and multiplayer support are on the way, with details regarding the fresh 2026 content roadmap to be revealed “within the coming months.”</span></p>

<p>You should not underestimate the power of Ninjutsu under any circumstances in Nioh 3. If a boss is performing a big attack, leaving you cowering, you should be hurling some Ninjutsu its way to deal damage and maybe even immobilize it.</p>



<p>Ninjutsu is the secondary aspect of the Ninja style in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a>. Samurai is all about hitting hard; Ninja is about hitting often. Another way to inflict damage (or disable) is by using the best Ninjutsu weapons and gear.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-ninjutsu-you-should-use-in-nioh-3">Best Ninjutsu You Should Use In Nioh 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>OP. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Burrow is hands down the best Ninjutsu ability you need to equip in Nioh 3.</strong></p>



<p>Nioh 3 becomes a different game once you unlock and equip Burrow. Tired of unmissable Boss attacks hitting you? Tired of being struck by those sneaky, irritating combos you can’t remember the sequence for and don’t know how to deal with? Are you also tired of getting hit by annoying mob enemies when you just want to get past? Burrow is the answer.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>This is an absolute game-changer and lifesaver in one. We all know how difficult it can be to dodge or evade a boss’ grab attacks. Why try to dodge when you can quite literally vanish for a few seconds underground? Not only that, but you can emerge behind the enemy and deal extra damage.</p>



<p>It’s much handier for boss fights than it is for general exploration, so bear this in mind. It might be worthwhile swapping it out for something else in the meantime. But given that the biggest timesink will undoubtedly be bosses, Burrow is the clear favorite here.</p>

<p><strong>You get three slots to use in your Ninjutsu setup for Nioh 3, and you should be using Burrow, Cicada Shell, and the Paralysis Shuriken.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-trophy-list-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 Trophy List—How To Get All Achievements &amp; Trophies &amp; Difficulty Rating</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is the best Ninjutsu setup by default. Now, is it an imperative in every situation? Absolutely not, but these are the best three to have together, so let’s explain why.</p>



<h3 id="h-burrow">Burrow</h3>



<p>Pretty much see above. There is few very circumstances where Burrow won’t save your life, give you some kind of advantage, or get you somewhere quicker by evading or sidestepping a mob. It’s the best Ninjutsu, and given what it does, it seems a natural fit for the bottom slot.</p>



<h3 id="h-cicada-shell">Cicada Shell</h3>



<p>You might sense that we’re putting defense and self-preservation as more important factors than offense, and you would be correct. Cicada Shell makes it so that once activated, if you get hit, you will <strong>teleport behind the enemy</strong>. This is another defensive solution that can get you out of a fix and help you deliver some cheap shots.</p>



<h3 id="h-paralysis-shuriken">Paralysis Shuriken</h3>



<p>This one is fairly interchangeable depending on the opponent. If you’re facing a boss, paralyzing them is always a HUGE benefit. Anything that immobilizes a foe, slows them down, and generally gives you a chance to get in some free shots needs to be utilized to the fullest. Plus, if you can synergize the paralysis infliction with gear or Accessories, it will speed up and prolong the effect.</p>



<p>If the boss has a certain weakness, then maybe the fire version of the Shuriken should be equipped, and so on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>YAPYAP isn’t just about casting Spells and causing chaos, as there are plenty of monsters to avoid and counter, some of which are truly terrifying.</p>



<p>Monsters in YAPYAP come in a variety of forms, ranging from the frustrating, but easily defeatable, to powerful Monsters that will quickly end any run if you encounter them.</p>



<p>For tips on how to counter every monster in YAPYAP, Insider Gaming has you covered, and more monsters will be added to this article when counters are discovered.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-yapyap-monsters">All YAPYAP Monsters</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Army up. Image via Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-goblins">Goblins</h3>



<p>The biggest threat posed by Goblins is if they overwhelm you with their numbers, but they can easily be kept at bay by using the Aero Spell with the Wand of Winds. This doesn’t eliminate their threat entirely, however, but there’s an easy way to do that.</p>



<p>With the Grotesque Wand, cast Fish-Yuk at a Goblin to turn them into a fish, which can then be picked up and moved, and you can throw them off the edge into the abyss. If there’s no edge nearby, turning them into fish still allows for a quick getaway.</p>



<h3 id="h-guards">Guards</h3>



<p>Red Knight Guards are one of the most powerful monsters in YAPYAP and can eliminate you with just a couple of hits. They do have weaknesses; however, if you have the right tools in your arsenal, knocking their helmet off is a great way to earn extra Chaos.</p>



<p>Be quiet around the Guards, as they are attracted to your voice, and loop around them to create space, as they are slow movers. With the Wand of Illusions, you can cast the Float Oculus spell and take over a Guard, moving them out of the way, or attacking other monsters with them to clear an area.</p>



<p>The Wand of Illusions can also be used to cast a duplicate of yourself with the Echo Me Spell, which is an easy way to distract the Guards, and the Fish-Yuk Spell can turn Guards into Fish, but there’s a limited time to get rid of them before it transforms back.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-eye">The Eye</h3>



<p>The Eye has an annoying habit of spawning in areas where there is limited room, making it hard to avoid its ranged attack that quickly blitzes through your health bar, but thankfully, it is a static enemy that can’t move.</p>



<p>Breaking the line of sight with The Eye disables its attack, so jump behind anything you can to neutralize it, with walls and pillars being the best options. Once the line of sight has been erased, The Eye will disappear, but it isn’t gone completely and will, more than likely, return.</p>



<p>While it’s not too difficult to avoid The Eye, the real danger comes when it serves as a distraction with other monsters in the area, so be alert. It’s another monster that you can turn into a fish, but there is a short period of time to get rid of it.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-slime">The Slime</h3>



<p>The Slime is a slow-moving cube of jelly that is mostly harmless, as the damage it deals is low, but getting trapped inside the cube will slow you down majorly, making you easy pickings for another monster.</p>



<p>Though they are mostly easy to avoid, unless they’re blocking your exit, they’re also easy to defeat using the Piss-Yuk Spell with the Grotesque Wand, so cast the Spell and make sure to keep a constant flow of noise to increase the rate of urination.</p>



<p>Unlike other enemies, The Slime cannot be transformed into a Fish.</p>



<h3 id="h-spider">Spider</h3>



<p>The Spider is one of the most terrifying monsters in all of YAPYAP, and the best point of action is to just avoid it entirely. Keep an ear out for scuttling sounds, which are a big indicator that an eight-legged freak is nearby, and navigate cautiously.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but sometimes there is no avoiding the Spider. In these instances, the Wand of Fire is the best bet, as it can deal decent damage with Ignis Breath and Ignis Doom, but the most valuable Spell is Ignis Legs, providing a speed boost to help you escape.</p>



<p>Turning the Spider into a fish with the Fish-Yuk spell is an option, but the duration is very short, so use any time to escape and don’t try to pick the fish up.</p>



<h3 id="h-mimic">Mimic</h3>



<p>The Mimic can easily catch you off guard, as it will take the form of you or a teammate, but it is relatively easy to defeat, with most Spels that deal damage effective against them.</p>



<p>Similar to Goblins, the Fish-Yuk Spell with the Grotesque Wand is an easy option, turning them into fish that you can throw off the edge of the map into the abyss, but any damage-dealing spell with the Wand of Fire is similarly effective.</p>



<h3 id="h-gargoyles">Gargoyles</h3>



<p>Gargoyles fall into the same sort of category as Mimics and Goblins, as they’re not too challenging when isolated and can be easily defeated with the Fish-Yuk approach and hauling them off the edge of the world.</p>



<p>The biggest threat posed by Gargoyles is the potential jump scare, as they will start off looking like any Gargoyle statue on the map before springing to life. As such, take good care around these objects, and be ready to fight back.</p>



<h3 id="h-time-ghost">Time Ghost</h3>



<p>There is no defeating the Time Ghost, which appears when you and your teammates run out of time, and it will kill you instantly, and there’s no counter.</p>



<p>Instead, keep a close eye on the countdown at the top-left of the screen, which indicates how much time you have left, and ensure you extract before the timer reaches zero.</p>
