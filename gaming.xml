			<p>The entire staff of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher of multiple celebrated titles, including the well-known cat game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-blade-review-unepic-journey/">Stray</a>, reportedly resigned this month after a dispute with its owner.</p>
<p>According to a new&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjE3NzQyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NzgyMjI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSlBZWklUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.BpoA_wBJDrNbDbgj_LjnVUJQg6SM_vsIzWUEM6v85xE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a>, the publisher's president, Nathan Gary, and his team had been negotiating with Annapurna's owner, Megan Ellison, to spin off the video game division as an independent entity. The negotiations ended when Ellison pulled out, prompting Gary and the other executive to resign. The rest of the staff followed shortly after</span>.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Bloomberg, Ellison confirmed that Annapurna's priority is to continue supporting its developer and publishing partners during this transition. The company is also committed to expanding its presence in the interactive space by continuing to look for new opportunities.</p>
<p>Development teams partnered with Annapurna Interactive are obviously scrambling to understand what this all means for future projects. New president Hector Sanchez, one of the publisher's co-founders who was brought back last month, reportedly told developers that all contracts will be honored and staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>Annapurna Interactive provides various services to partners, including funding, quality assurance, localization, and marketing, so it's understandable the confusion among developers whose projects may never see the light of day if the publisher folds. Among the successful games published by the company are the aforementioned Stray, Cocoon, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, and many others.</p>

According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjE3NzQyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NzgyMjI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSlBZWklUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.BpoA_wBJDrNbDbgj_LjnVUJQg6SM_vsIzWUEM6v85xE">Bloomberg</a>, Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gary and his team had been in the midst of a negotiation to spin the division off into its own independent entity. When Ellison pulled back from said negotiations, Gary and other top staff decided to resign and were followed by around two dozen other staff members.</p>
<p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition,” Ellison told Bloomberg when asked for comment. She also noted the company's commitment to their existing games, as well as expanding their presence in the interactive space across film, TV, and gaming.</p>
<p>This development has led to a bit of a mess as developers partnered with Annapurna rush to figure out what this means for in-progress projects. Annapurna had been tasked with funding games, handling quality assurance, localization and marketing. Game makers working with Annapurna have been scrambling over the last few days to try and figure out if the company still plans to honor those agreements.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company did tell Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain under Annapurna, as well as replace staff who left.</p>
<p>Annapurna is well known for their publishing chops including the critically acclaimed <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="253e212b-e5d4-4268-ba6a-be3eec1408ca" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stray-review">Stray</a> </em>and <em>Outer Wilds</em>. Last month the company announced plans to partner with Remedy to bring <em>Alan Wake</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e85d597-36e4-4a59-b420-c18f463b0f42" href="https://techraptor.net/games/control"><em>Control</em></a> to TV productions.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> - the video game publisher behind the acclaimed likes of Outer Wilds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a>, and Cocoon - has reportedly seen a complete exodus of staff following a dispute with the company's owner, causing "chaos" among developer partners.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, around two dozen employees - including Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and other executives - resigned after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison broke down. Gary and his time had reportedly been negotiating to spin off Annapurna Interactive - Annapurna's video-game publishing wing - as an independent entity, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement with Ellison.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg claims the departures have caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners - who've all signed deals with the publisher to secure the likes of funding, QA, and marketing - as they've sought reassurances about their projects' future. However, an Annapurna spokesperson confirmed to Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez is said to have told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.

"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition," Ellison said in a statement provided to Bloomberg. "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."
</p>
<p>
Annapurna has already announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">broad slate of new titles</a> set to launch over the next few years, including developer No Code's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim, Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's Mixtape, Messhof's Ghost Bike, and Annapurna's first internally developed game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> 2033: Labyrinth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bully-rockstar-pc-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As part of our Back to School week</a>, I <em>had </em>planned on playing through Rockstar's <em>Bully </em>and comparing Jimmy's experience at a strict boarding school with my own.</p><p>I didn't <em>attend </em>a boarding school, but after graduating high school I worked in one for a year in the UK (if you know what a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gap year</a> is, this was mine). I mostly did odd jobs wherever my skillset could best be employed: some sports coaching here, some history and art tutoring there, alongside some general supervision of kids in the boarding house common spaces after school hours. Which all sounds very adult, but I was actually just <em>17 years old </em>when I started the job. Now that I type that out, it seems kinda fucked up. Maybe I shouldn't have been allowed to do that, especially since I was sometimes legally responsible for the welfare of senior students who were 19. One Italian kid I remember had a <em>beard</em>.</p><p>Despite the school I worked at being in England and <em>Bully</em>'s Bullworth Academy being set in <em>New</em> England, I figured there were enough similarities between the two--the uniforms, the strict regime, the weird emphasis on violence and sex so many of the cooped-up kids seemed obsessed with--to write a piece on.</p><p>But then I actually installed and tried to play the PC's <em>Scholarship Edition</em> of <em>Bully</em>, a game I remember from almost 20 years ago as being pretty good, and Jesus Christ. It's bad.&nbsp;</p><p>First up, while the game nominally supported 4K, actually opting for that resolution broke its display, and I had to go into the game's executable options to fix it. Not a great start. It's not the only area we’ve come a long way from since 2006. <em>Bully</em>'s camera movement and player movement aren't tracked at the same speed, so moving the camera around behind the player while also moving the character causes you to run in weird directions, unable to move in a straight line for more than a few seconds at a time. It has text prompts that look like they were lifted from Windows 3.1, and the combat--probably the most important aspect of the game other than Jimmy's ability to cover long distances on foot--is dreary.</p><p>And man, I don't remember the 2000s being this overtly <em>mean</em>. The entire vibe of the game is just bleak, from the design of the school itself to the way every single character is just hugely draining to listen to and be around. I get that it's a product of its time, and a specific idea within that time, but boy, from 2024 it's a borderline repulsive place.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bully Trailer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88KNf0MtU14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I am a man in my 40s who normally has no trouble playing and enjoying games from different eras, but there was something about this game's <em>specific </em>rough edges and narrative focus that brought a hard "no" from me almost instantly. It's not that <em>Bully </em>is old. It's just that it's...bad. Bad in so many ways that I decided to look up its original reviews from the time and had my mind blow. Here's<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/16/bully-collectors-edition-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As has become the standard for Rockstar titles, the characterization and humor in this game is top notch. Bully is easily one of the funniest PlayStation 2 titles we've ever seen and is one of the few pieces of software out there than can legitimately be called a "comedy."</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's wild how low our collective bars were back then for this specific type of experience. So many games and genres can stand the test of time, but <em>Bully</em>, once lauded as a success, now looks and plays like dogshit. And I was playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(video_game)#Scholarship_Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remastered version of the game</a>!</p><p>So sorry everyone, I am <em>not </em>going to be comprehensively comparing my own boarding school experiences with those found in <em>Bully</em>, because I am not going to be playing all the way through this game when I could be doing literally anything else. Maybe that'll change if Rockstar ever get around to properly remastering--or even remaking--it, but given the fact you can already buy it on PC, warts or not, I'm not going to be holding my breath.</p><p>Just so you don't think I'm entirely ducking out from my original pitch, though, what I will say about my boarding school experience from what little I played/remember of <em>Bully </em>is that while there were <em>some </em>similarities between the kids at my school and Bullworth Academy--namely, an extreme obsession with sex and violence (as separate concepts, not both at the same time), the kids I was living with were still...kids? Sure, they'd get in fights a lot, but they were still identifiably kid fights, not the 80's college movie x nature documentary shit that <em>Bully</em> is so obsessed with.</p><p>And when you hung out with them or asked them about their future plans or what they'd done on the weekend, they were, once again, just kids. As opposed to everyone in <em>Bully</em>, who exists somewhere on a spectrum between "exhausted stereotype" and "overwrought villain" in the way so many other Rockstar characters did until we were <em>well </em>into the 2010s.</p><p>Looking back at <em>Bully</em>, it's hard to recommend almost any of it. If you want to play a 2000's Rockstar experience (I know this was developed by Rockstar Vancouver, not the North team, but it's still got the star on the box), <em>Vice City </em>remains the pinnacle. And if you want to play a game set in a boarding school, where there's loads of fighting and romantic options and lessons to attend and a world to explore outside the classroom, then just...go play <em>Persona 3</em> instead.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

		<p>Valve has launched their broad overhaul to the family game sharing in Steam with the new Steam Families system. This replaces both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing?snr=1_2108_9__2107"><span data-tooltip-text="store.steampowered.com">Steam Family Sharing</span></a> and <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6B1A-66BE-E911-3D98"><span data-tooltip-text="help.steampowered.com">Steam Family View</span></a>, and will require you to set up your family group anew, but gives renewed flexibility for a lot of multi-user gaming situations.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Steam Families" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b248W74jcFc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A family group gives members access to Family Sharing, Parental Controls and the new Child Purchase Requests.</p>
<p>The biggest change for Steam Family Sharing is that, instead of sharing a single person’s library, it now brings together up to six people and all of their combined games. All of their owned games are still individually owned and purchased, but are pooled together in a game library which can be played on a game-by-game and license-by-license basis – so if two people own the same game, then any two family members can play that game at the same time. Additionally, someone can play a family member’s game, even if another game is being played.</p>


<p>The biggest thing to be aware of, if you join a family group, is that if you leave a group, you cannot join another family for one year – you can go back to the last family group, though, without waiting.</p>
<p>There are also limits to the game library, with developers and publishers able to exclude their games from Family Sharing, just as they could with the old system. Most are included, though. You can view <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=62">all games tagged with ‘Family Sharing’ here</a>, which shows the very latest games like Space Marine 2 and Black Myth: Wukong included. You can also filter your existing library to see what’s available to share.</p>
<p>Further to game sharing are parental controls, with adults able to manage and control child account access through restricting access to Steam features, setting age gates, playtime limits (with reporting, and the ability to approve or deny requests for temporary access. New Child Purchase Requests let kids ask for a game or DLC purchase via Steam, which is then approved and paid for by the adult, but added to the child’s account.</p>
<p>For more details <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/054C-3167-DD7F-49D4">see Valve’s detailed FAQ</a></p>

Once a game was downloaded a certain number of times and had made a specific amount of money, Unity would start charging developers a Runtime Fee every single time someone installed any game developed using Unity, like <em>Pokémon GO </em>or <em>Cuphead</em>. Many smaller devs and creators criticized the decision and claimed it would lead to developers abandoning the engine to avoid paying thousands of dollars in install fees. This could have led to game delays and there was even fear that some devs might remove older games from sale, preventing players from re-installing them in order to avoid the Runtime Fees.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unity-runtime-fee-news-twitter-developers-godot-unreal-1850848538&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unity-runtime-fee-news-twitter-developers-godot-unreal-1850848538">All of this was a giant mess</a></span> that eventually led to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unity-engine-runtime-fees-install-changes-devs-1850865615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unity-engine-runtime-fees-install-changes-devs-1850865615">Unity partially walking back some of these decisions a week later</a></span>.

And now, after <em>all that</em>, the company is fully ditching the install fees completely.</p><p>On Thursday, in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on Unity’s website</a></span>, CEO Matthew Bromberg announced the news that “effective immediately” the company was removing all Runtime Fees from the engine.</p><p>“I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form,” said Bromberg.</p><h2 id="h13936"><a id=""></a>Unity reveals price increases for some plans</h2><p>So Runtime Fees are gone and Unity will return to a subscription model. Bromberg confirmed that Unity Personal licenses will remain free until a game brings in over $200,00 in revenue or funding. Meanwhile, starting in January 2025, Unity Pro subscriptions will increase by 8% and cost $2,200 a year. Unity Enterprise will also see a price increase of 25%.</p><p>Unity Personal will remain free, with the revenue and funding ceiling increased from $100,000 to $200,000, giving developers more flexibility before being subjected to Unity’s fees. The Made with Unity splash screen will be optional for games developed with Unity 6, set to launch later this year.</p><p>Starting January 1, 2025, Unity Pro will see an 8% price increase, raising the annual subscription fee to $2,200 per seat. Unity Enterprise will experience a 25% increase, with new minimum subscription requirements for customers generating over $25 million in annual revenue. These changes will apply to all new and existing subscriptions from that date. (Because these licenses involve major companies, the prices can vary based on different packages.)</p><p>Bromberg stressed in his blog post that Unity will continue to increase prices as it needs to, but will only do so annually via subscription fees going up. It won’t try to squeeze pennies out of every developer using the engine based on how many times people install your game.</p><p>“Canceling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners,” said Bromberg.</p><p>“Thank you all for your trust and continued support. We look forward to many more years of making great games together.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some love them and others hate them, viewing the spin-off largely as a cringe cash-grab with little involvement from series creator Akira Toriyama. Plus, the popularity of <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, which continued the original storyline and pretended like <em>GT</em> was a bad dream, suggested the misfits might not get top-billing anymore despite being mainstays of the previous <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> games. Why waste a slot on Great Ape Baby? Save them for optional DLC and let the sickos goes wild.</p><p>But nope. The motley crew of alternate-future <em>Dragon Ball</em> hunters will be playable from the jump. The <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>subreddit was full of blown minds today. “Chat is this real???? Omfg we back !!!!!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff2fe7/chat_is_this_real_omfg_we_back/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff2fe7/chat_is_this_real_omfg_we_back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read one thread</a></span>. “My denier-ass getting roasted but I’m happy anyway,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff1h4o/my_denierass_getting_roasted_but_im_happy_anyway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff1h4o/my_denierass_getting_roasted_but_im_happy_anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read another</a></span>. <em>GT </em>believers have spent the day <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff1ij4/it_was_real_lmfao/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff1ij4/it_was_real_lmfao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrating</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff0p6t/gt_deniers_rn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1ff0p6t/gt_deniers_rn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rubbing it in</a></span>. But not everyone’s onboard. <em>GT </em>haters just see another string of slots that won’t go to characters they actually like, and there’s no shortage of <em>Dragon Ball</em> icons who<em>&nbsp;</em>deserve to get the call-up. <br></p><p>There are only 10 slots left unrevealed now, with less than a month to go before launch. The biggest roster ever was still never going to satisfy everyone. Even <em>GT</em> stans aren’t completely satiated. Super 17, a buff, grown-up form of the android after he’s wished back to life in the spin-off, wasn’t among today’s roster additions. Fortunately, <em>Sparking Zero </em>will also be on PC, and fans can mod in whoever they want to their hearts’ content. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div><p>A beloved board game from 2002 is getting a brand new edition. Recently, Awaken Realms and Ravensburger launched a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Puerto Rico Special Edition</em>: a modern streamlined remake of the original. The project was fully funded three minutes after going live on Gamefound.</p>

<p>According to its Gamefound <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/awaken-realms/puerto-rico-special-edition">campaign page</a>, <em>Puerto Rico Special Edition</em> is an improved definitive release of the original euro game.

<p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) has issued a statement on Microsoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest round of layoffs</a> that sees another 650 people let go from the company. </p>



<p>The CWA, which admittedly doesn’t represent anyone laid off in the latest layoffs, still represents workers within Microsoft, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-developers-have-formed-a-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers on World of Warcraft</a> within Blizzard. They say they are disappointed to see more layoffs from “one of the world’s largest and most profitable corporations”.</p>



<p>“Every worker deserves a voice on the job and a say over the impact of job cuts,” Samuel Cooper, Senior Producer at World of Warcraft and member of WoWGG-CWA, said via the statement. “While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve ‘long term success’ without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common. </p>



<p>“We stand in solidarity with everyone who lost their job&nbsp;today&nbsp;and encourage all video game workers to join with us and form unions so we can protect each other.”</p>



<p>While unions can’t fully prevent layoffs, the CWA says that they do help employees when it comes to how the layoffs are handled in general.</p>



<p>The CWA added that it remains “committed to supporting workers at Microsoft and throughout the tech and video game industry who seek to form a union and improve their workplace.”</p>



<p>What do you think of the layoffs at Microsoft and the CWA’s statement? &nbsp;Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Unity, maker of a popular cross-platform engine and toolkit, will not pursue a broadly unpopular Runtime Fee that would have charged developers based on game installs rather than per-seat licenses. The move comes exactly one year after the fee's initial announcement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">a blog post</a> attributed to President and CEO Matt Bromberg, the CEO writes that the company cannot continue "democratizing game development" without "a partnership built on trust." Bromberg states that customers understand the necessity of price increases, but not in "a novel and controversial new form." So game developers will not be charged per installation, but they will be sorted into Personal, Pro, and Enterprise tiers by level of revenue or funding.</p>
<p>"Canceling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," Bromberg writes.</p>
<h2>A year of discontent</h2>
<p>Unity's announcement of a new "Runtime Fee that's based on game installs" in mid-September 2023 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230912135629/https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates">Wayback archive</a>), while joined by cloud storage and "AI at runtime," would have been costly for smaller developers who found success. The Runtime Fee would have cost 20 cents per install on the otherwise free Personal tier after a game had reached $200,000 in revenue and more than 200,000 installs. Fees decreased slightly for Pro and Enterprise customers after $1 million in revenue and 1 million installs.
</p><p>The move led to almost immediate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/game-developers-unite-against-unitys-new-per-install-pricing-structure/">backlash from many developers</a>. Unity, whose then-CEO John Riccitiello had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/theres-no-royalties-no-f-ing-around-riccitiello">described in 2015</a> as having "no royalties, no [f-ing] around," was "quite simply not a company to be trusted," wrote <a href="https://insertcredit.com/opinion/unity/">Necrosoft Games' Brandon Sheffield</a>. Developers said they would hold off updates or switch engines rather than absorb the fee, which would have retroactively counted installs before January 2024 toward its calculations.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Unity's terms of service <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/wait-is-unity-allowed-to-just-change-its-fee-structure-like-that/">seemed to allow for such sudden shifts</a>. Unity <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/unity-makes-major-changes-to-controversial-install-fee-program/">softened the impact of the fee</a> on Personal users, removed the backdated install counting, and capped fees at 2.5 percent of revenue. Unity Create President and General Manager Marc Whitten <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/unity-exec-tells-ars-hes-on-a-mission-to-earn-back-developer-trust/">told Ars at that time</a> that while the fee would seemingly not affect the vast majority of Unity users, he understood that a stable agreement should be a feature of the engine.
</p><p>However coincidentally or not, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-retiring-effective-immediately/">Riccitiello announced his retirement</a> the next month, which led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/game-devs-say-riccitiello-leaving-unity-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction/">some celebration among devs</a>, but not total restoration of trust. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">massive wave of layoffs</a> throughout the winter of 2023 and 2024 showed that Unity's financial position was precarious, partly due to acquisitions during Riccitiello's term. The Runtime Fee would have minimal impact in 2024, the company said in filings, but would "ramp from there as customers adopt our new releases."</p>
<p>Instead of ramping from there, the Runtime Fee is now gone, and Unity has made other changes to its pricing structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity Personal remains free, and its revenue/funding ceiling increases from $100,000 to $200,000</li>
<li>Unity Pro, for customers over the Personal limit, sees an 8 percent price increase to $2,200 per seat</li>
<li>Unity Enterprise, with customized packages for those over $25 million in revenue or funding, sees a 25 percent increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>"From this point forward, it’s our intention to revert to a more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis," Bromberg wrote in his post. Changes to Unity's Editor software should allow customers to keep using their existing version under previously agreed terms, he wrote.</p>

            <p>There's no greater tool in video games than a grappling hook. 2022's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grapple-dog">Grapple Dog</a> knew that, making it the core ability of its platforming. The ability returns in sequel Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines, out today, although there's now a second character to play as for those fools who favour shooting over hooking.

<p>Pablo, the protagonist from the first game, returns with some new powers including fire-dashing, but players can also switch on the fly to a secondary pup, Luna. Luna seems to be Shadow to Pablo's Sonic: an edgy anti-hero with an arsenal of guns that might be better suited to certain enemies or challenges.
</p>
<p>Otherwise it seems to closely follow the formula of the first game. That won't please everyone. Matt Cox found the original pretty frustrating in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grapple-dog-review">Grapple Dog review</a>, as it killed him over and over with big gaps between checkpoints.

<p>"Demanding mastery through repetition can work for platformers, but only if it’s done carefully and thoughtfully, where you don’t have to go slug through long trivial stretches before you get another go at the hard bit. The grappling here feels good when you’re allowed to build momentum, but too many levels are more interested in killing it," he wrote.
</p>
<p>That's pretty negative, and Grapple Dog never clicked with me either in the short time I played. Still, I watch every trailer of the first game and of this sequel and think, yeah, that looks like good stuff. I want to be good at that.
</p>
<p>So here's news of the sequel. I'll try getting into it again. Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines is out now and currently costs £12/$14.39/€13.99 with the 20% launch discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2278790/Grapple_Dogs_Cosmic_Canines/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The break-in allegedly occurred at 3:30 A.M. while  store employees were closing up for the night. The thieves had what appeared to be a knife. After tying up the employees, the two robbers walked out with over $70,000 worth of valuable <em>Pokémon</em> cards.

According to police, before tying them up with rope and covering their mouths with tape, the duo asked the employees which <em>Pokémon</em> cards were worth stealing. The thieves then left with over 100 trading cards worth about $10 million yen or about $70,000 USD. So it seems the employees did a good job recommending which cards to grab.</p><p>Police say the thieves took the two staff members’ phones and wallets, too. No injuries were reported.

<p>As the buildup to the release of Civilization 7 continues, Firaxis Games held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjUdkPW3zLg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer livestream</a> on Thursday afternoon. This hour-plus long session gave players a look at the Antiquity Age in Civilization 7, along with a number of new features coming to the game.</p>



<p>In addition to gameplay from the Antiquity Age, the developers gave a preview of transitioning from Antiquity to the Exploration Age. There was also a new reveal of Greece as an Antiquity Age civilization.</p>



<p>If you want to watch the full stream, you can do so below. However, we’ve also put together a recap of all the key highlights you need  to know about the game.</p>



<p>Civilization 7 releases on February 11, 2025 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Let us know your thoughts on how Civilization 7 is shaping up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/civilization-7-antiquity-age-livestream-recap.157/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the all new Insider Gaming Forums!</a></p>



<h2 id="h-civilization-7-antiquity-age-livestream-gameplay-highlights">Civilization 7 Antiquity Age Livestream Gameplay Highlights</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first unit in the game are Founders. Founders create capital cities in Civilization 7 whereas Settler units establish towns. They are separate units.</li>



<li>Settlers won’t just get captured immediately when attacked. They can now attempt to defend themselves. However, they no longer get captured at all, instead they get destroyed.</li>



<li>Each civilization will have its own original soundtrack (OST) in the game.</li>



<li>Two types of rivers: minor and navigable.</li>



<li>Happiness is a full yield in Civilization 7.</li>



<li>Amina is a confirmed leader for the game.</li>



<li>The first unit you build in the Antiquity Age — Scout or Warrior — only take one turn, so you’ll have them by turn two.</li>



<li>Various terrain will end all movement. These include areas like vegetation (changes based on biome), rough terrain, and wetlands. Some units have the ability to move right through the difficult terrains.</li>



<li>Tech’s don’t unlock tile improvements. Instead, they unlock the yields for them.</li>



<li>No more workers/builders or unit. New Grow City action brings you options for what you can do on various tiles in your city.</li>



<li>City must grow linearly.</li>



<li>City expansion regarding tiles is the same as Civilization 6.</li>



<li>Scouts have a new search skill to reveal the area around them. There’s also a permanent lookout skill for the map.</li>



<li>Discoveries give you small narratives within the game, and options for the rewards you claim.</li>



<li>Each district can hold up to two buildings.</li>



<li>You can take areas such as a woodcutter, and move them to a different tile. You can then relocate the population somewhere else to still take advantage of them.</li>



<li>Eurekas and Inspirations are no longer part of the game. Similar goals still exist, but they don’t give any sort of boost to the tech tree. Instead, they are quests you can accept that yield various rewards.</li>



<li>Special districts are created by combining specific buildings that give bonuses based on the civilization.</li>



<li>Your Happiness yield will help determine your celebrations based on a threshold. The government within your civilization will change the celebrations offered.</li>



<li>Influence is used for diplomatic  actions within the game.</li>



<li>Settled downs can have specialties such as mining, farming, trade towns, etc.</li>



<li>If you go above city limits, you will suffer happiness penalties.</li>



<li>Great People are unique to civilizations.</li>



<li>Roads are created between cities automatically within a certain distance.</li>



<li>Every civilization has a unique wonder that can be unlocked in different ways</li>



<li>Army Commanders are new units. They have different promotion trees such as Assault, Logistics, Leadership, etc. They replaced Great Generals, and can respawn over time.</li>



<li>Your resources can be allocated to specific cities within your civilization.</li>



<li>Milestones are achieved within each age. There are four paths within each age (Culture, Military, Science, Economic).</li>



<li>Moving to the next age sees you take your legacy points you’ve unlocked during your play, and spend them on a variety of perks.</li>



<li>Select elements such as civilization traditions will carry over into your new age and civilization. Entering a new age will have you pick a new civilization that is unique to that age. </li>
</ul>

<p>Another year, another Thunderpick World Championship. This ever-evolving Counter-Strike 2 tournament now boasts a $1 million prize pool, which is the largest single prize ever offered by a sportsbook in a competitive setting. Recently, the full roster of teams was locked in as Thunderpick announced the invited teams that’ll join those that qualified in a series of events held since April 2024.</p>



<p>Last year, the inaugural Thunderpick World Championship took place, boasting a $600,000 prize pool, the majority of which was claimed by FaZe Clan.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>Later this year, the Thunderpick World Championship will come to a close in Berlin, Germany. It has been running in a qualification capacity since April, and in November, everything comes to a head. On a grand stage, some of the best Counter-Strike teams in the business will compete for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize, a record-setting sum.</p>



<p>It was recently announced that the following teams have been invited to compete in the final stages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Heroic</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>They’ll be joining the teams that qualified through a string of events held earlier this year:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bestia</li>



<li>BIG</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>Team Legacy</li>



<li>BLEED</li>
</ul>



<p>In anticipation of the landmark event, Thunderpick’s Kelly Sanders said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Thunderpick World Championship 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most exciting tournaments of the year. With the caliber of teams and record-setting prize pool, we can expect intense competition and high-quality gameplay that will captivate fans and players around the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also noted that GRID remains the official esports services provider and data partner of the Thunderpick World Championship. GRID has long been a spearhead in the world of esports data, offering intricate and intelligent data solutions, tournament tools, and visualisation platforms. </p>

It comes with gold Zelda-themed Joy-Con controllers, a white dock accented with the Hylian Crest and a circular pattern that matches the back of the console itself. The console does not come with the game, but you can grab a copy for a discount at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097B2YWFX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.</p><p>It's a big plus that this special-edition was made for the OLED console, the best of the three Switch models. It has the same internal hardware as the base model Switch, but with some welcome improvements like double the internal storage, a sturdier kickstand, and a wider dock with an ethernet port.</p><p>Naturally, the biggest improvement is swapping LCD for OLED screen tech. The 7-inch display is gorgeous. Nintendo games often have bright color palettes, and the Switch OLED has a wider and more vibrant color range. The other big benefit of OLED displays is they handle black and dark colors better than LCD displays.</p><p>If you decide to pick up the Zelda-themed Switch OLED ahead of Echoes of Wisdom's launch, there are some accessories you could pair it with.</p><p>The official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Legend-Kingdom/dp/B0BZTFWHV9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom Switch Pro Controller</a> originally launched alongside the console for $75. It's been out of stock at major retailers ever since, but you can pick one up for $85 from a third-party seller with Prime delivery directly from Amazon.</p><p>That's a pretty solid price at this point, but you could opt for third-party Zelda controllers to save some cash. One option is this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Nintendo-Switch-Controller-Officially/dp/B0BZMJTD6V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA wireless controller featuring the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and Hylian Crest</a>. It's on sale for only $27, down from $45, and it has two remappable back buttons.</p><p>The Zelda-themed Joy-Con controllers are certainly pretty, but Joy-Cons aren't the best in the ergonomics department. One way to fix that would be to pick up a Switch OLED grip that adds traditional controller handles for portable play. Satisfye released an excellent (unofficial) Zelda-themed grip specifically designed to match the Tears of the Kingdom console. You can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Compatible-Comfortable-Ergonomic-Accessories/dp/B0BZZDMYHW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ZenGrip Pro</a> for $45, or you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Compatible-Comfortable-Ergonomic-Accessories/dp/B0CDD9CFKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">newer ZenGrip Ronin</a>--grants access to the kickstand when the grip is attached--for $50. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Inc-ZenGrip-Accessories-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B0CDNP22W6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ronin bundle with a matching carrying case</a> is available for $70.</p><p>The console comes with a Joy-Con grip for docked play, but if you want a Zelda-themed model, there are a few options for cheap. For $13.49, you can get a grip from PowerA featuring <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Joy-Comfort-Grip-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0B5S1KY83?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Princess Zelda</a>. PowerA also has versions featuring <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Comfort-Nintendo-Switch-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C8MCBRZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Link</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Joy-Comfort-Grip-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CT5HYJ2H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Master Sword</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, you can keep your Zelda Joy-Con controllers pristine by swapping them out for the Tears of the Kingdom-themed Split Pad Pro by Hori. The Split Pad offers a more traditional shape with larger buttons and sticks as well as adding two remappable back buttons. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Split-Legend-Zelda-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C4VN8TTF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Tears of the Kingdom Split Pad Pro</a> usually retails for $60, but it's on sale for $49.22 right now.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Legend-Kingdom/dp/B0BZTFWHV9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller -

Having teased <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s latest season of content last week, EA has more firmly detailed its upcoming Storybook Nursery Kit and Artist Studio Kit DLC releases, which are both now set to arrive next Thursday, 19th September.
</p>
<p>
Starting with The Sims 4's Artist Studio Kit, it includes - as you've probably already guessed - a bunch of new furniture items and decorative bric-a-brac that can be combined to make a suitably chaotic space for Sims to unleash their creativity.
</p>
<p>
"Set up your new easel in the centre of your studio," EA writes, "surrounded by tools of the trade – a variety of brushes, colourful paint cans and new inspiring still-life objects that Sims can paint from reference or draw creativity from." Expect drawers and shelves, tubes of paint, sketchbooks, palettes, plus a new tablet and woodworking table.

<p>
As for the Storybook Nursery Kit, this one's been developed in conjunction with renowned Sims 4 creator SixamCC. The theme here is 'balancing the joy of a new arrival with elevated charm', and its included ojects are all designed to look as if they were "passed down through generations and will be passed down to future generations, ensuring a legacy of elegance within each family".
</p>
<p>
"Bring your newborns, infants and toddlers into a space that balances sophistication and whimsy with delicately crafted toys, appealing wallpaper, a dreamy mobile, and more," continues EA's blurb, "available in colours that range from rich and moody darks to delicate pastels of a bygone era." It'll also feature "ornate cribs, bassinets and beds, a sweeping canopy and a tasteful chandelier".

</p>
<p>
And as for what's next, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">previously revealed</a> the free Reaper's Rewards Event is coming to The Sim 4's base game on 24th September, and the still-mysterious Life and Death Expansion Pack is due to launch on 31st October - with more details being shared on 3rd October.

That’s because in addition to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve"><strong>Steam Deck LCD</strong></a> with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%23%3A~%3Atext%3D64GB%2520and%2520512GB%2520Steam%2520Deck%2520LCD%2520models%2520are%2520on%2520sale%2520through%2520September%252026th%252C%252010am%2520Pacific">64GB of storage</a> once again selling for $296.65 (around $52 off), the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%23%3A~%3Atext%3D64GB%2520and%2520512GB%2520Steam%2520Deck%2520LCD%2520models%2520are%2520on%2520sale%2520through%2520September%252026th%252C%252010am%2520Pacific">512GB version</a>, complete with its fancier antiglare etched screen, is selling for a new low of $336.75 (about $112 off). These are some exceptional deals on the two Steam Deck models that are being phased out.</p><p>Whichever Steam Deck you choose, you’re getting an excellent PC gaming handheld with a seven-inch, 1280 x 800 display that’s compatible with many games on Steam. It may be a couple of years old and not as nice as the refreshed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> model, but it’s hard to beat even the cheapest Deck when it comes to playing indie games and even some massive open-world AAA titles that are tuned well for it — like <em>Elden Ring</em>. Plus, it’s such a flexible platform that allows you to install all kinds of things, including apps for in-home console game streaming, GeForce Now cloud streaming, and even a whole Windows OS.</p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join nearly 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p>The Steam Deck started out a little buggy and unfinished when it came out in early 2022, but after frequent updates and the addition of new features via software, it’s now an easy recommendation for even the non-tinkering types. Other formidable handhelds have come after it, but many are either clunkier to use (thanks, Windows) or, in the case of the excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, much pricier.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><em><strong>Correction, September 12th:</strong> This article initially listed the 256GB Steam Deck LCD as selling for $296.65, but it’s the 64GB that’s discounted to that price. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
