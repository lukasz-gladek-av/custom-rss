			<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was an early success for Ubisoft in 2024, or so it seemed anyway. It was the first relatively big game to launch this year and it got rave reviews, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco's 9/10 on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action game features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, sales haven't been nearly as positive, at least compared to Ubisoft's pre-release estimates. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to YouTuber Gautoz</a>, who talked to various members of the Montpellier office, there won't be any sequel and the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team is also practically disbanded.</p>
<p><em>You have to understand that internally, the writing was on the wall a few weeks after the game launched at the beginning of the year. By Spring, it was pretty clear – just a few patches, a DLC, and that was it. The more optimistic folks in the core team repeatedly pitched a sequel project, but then it turned into a struggle to get the green light for two DLCs, hoping to change the bosses' minds. But it was obvious that the decision had been made quickly, especially with the need for help on other projects with better sales potential.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft usually has a sales curve like a blockbuster—big launch, but this time, it started lower than expected. I've heard a justification that honestly drives me crazy as a gamer: if you let them make another one, it’ll eat into the long-term sales of this one. I've always thought the opposite; with a good sale on the first one, you could actually boost sales.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The production of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown wasn't exactly an issue—far from it, actually. For instance, there was crunch, but we're talking about a production with a really strong collective spirit, which is pretty different from how Ubisoft usually makes games with 80 to 100 people fully loaded on development, which is pretty small in comparison.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a classic big Ubisoft project, but it was a blessing to try out different organizational models. Some teams, like the gameplay team for example, were set up almost horizontally with a lot of listening and consultation. People felt like they really had a say in the project's direction. Plus, it's worth mentioning that the Prince of Persia team had often allowed people who were totally burned out due to too much time spent on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Somewhere along the way, it also helped some people get back on their feet after tough times in their careers. So these days, the big office reorganization at Ubisoft Montpellier is kind of wiping away the last traces of that team.</em></p>
<p>It is unfortunate since Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is arguably one of the very few critical successes enjoyed by Ubisoft lately. However, the company is now focused entirely on improving its sales, and it was even willing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows out of its scheduled November 2024 release window to avoid jeopardizing its signature franchise. They're also backing out of the Season Pass model, canceling early access, and returning to Steam in three unprecedented pro-consumer moves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-new-and-improved-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the new Xbox Wireless Headset was announced. This headset features the same sleek and classic look as the original Xbox Wireless Headset but comes with some new enhancements to make the headset better and provide a more immersive and seamless experience for those who want that surround sound feeling. For those who are interested in picking up the headset, you can purchase it for $109.99, with this new version of the headset officially replacing the original model. The headset is available for purchase now.</p>
<p>To make sure that players are getting the most immersive gaming experience with this new headset, players will be able to use Dolby Atmos for immersive, spatial audio at no additional cost. Compared to the previous headset, the battery life has now been improved and offers players up to 20 hours of playtime. Additionally, the microphone for the Xbox Wireless Headset has been improved, offering a new enhanced auto-mute and voice isolation system featuring Bluetooth 5.3. The Xbox Wireless Headset is available in all-black, with no current plans to create the headset in other colors.</p>
<p>If Dolby Atmos isn't your style, the Xbox Wireless Headset also comes with built-in support for Windows Sonic and DTS Headphone: X. For those who like to be able to hear every single detail during their gaming experience, this is the perfect audio combination. Just in time for October, the month when everyone is braving some new horror games.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't planning on using this headset for the Xbox, it has Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity for both PC and mobile devices, which means that players using this headset will be able to switch between devices without any issue, and there won't be endless fiddling around with the Bluetooth settings to try and get your devices to sync up. Additionally, there are no dongles or extra pieces of equipment that you'll need to use in order to get your headset working.</p>
<p>The Xbox Wireless Headset comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-suggests-samsung-and-google-are-developing-a-pair-of-mixed-reality-smart-glasses-instead-of-a-headset/">Qualcomm</a> S5 Gen 2 technology, providing a low-latency wireless connection, allowing for smooth gameplay and perfect communications between teammates.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/22/xbox-wireless-headset-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> for the Xbox Wireless headset, it is noted that for those wanting to use DTS Headphone: X, you may have to purchase additional content and apps to be able to use it. Additionally, the battery life of the headset depends on a number of factors, including the distance from the console, additional accessories, usage, and more.</p>

<p>The Wolf Among Us 2 has not been cancelled at Telltale Games. </p>



<p>The confirmation comes after rumors began to circulate over the last 24 hours that the game was almost to a point where Telltale “might have no choice but to shelve it”.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-not-cancelled-telltale-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Telltale Games assured fans that the game was still moving forward with development.</p>



<p>As a rule, we don’t comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,” the Telltale rep told the outlet. “But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we’re excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The original poster of the rumor has since deleted the claim.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2017, The Wolf Among Us 2 was first cancelled when Telltale Games had to shut down in 2018. Upon the studio’s revival in 2019, the game’s development was restarted. It was planned for a release in 2023, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-out-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed due to development</a> “requiring more time”. Since then, it’s been silent on when the game could come.</p>



<p>The studio did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/telltale-games-allegedly-fires-most-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff a significant number</a> of people in 2023, however, according to former cinematic artist Jonah Huang.</p>



<p>What do you think of the state of The Wolf Among Us 2 amid cancellation rumors? Let us know in the comments or the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

(Studio X is the studio behind Throne and Liberty.) It’s unclear at this stage what NCSoft’s troubles mean for ArenaNet, the Bellevue, Washington-based studio behind Guild Wars. Earlier this year, Guild Wars 3 was said to have been in development, although work continues on Guild Wars 2.</p><p>Some video games will be canceled, howoever, alongside layoffs via a voluntary retirement program, the co-CEOs confirmed. "Major changes are inevitable for the survival and future of the company, and we promise active support and compensation to those affected,” they said.</p><p>Earlier this month, Amazon Games announced that Throne and Liberty had seen more than three million players in just a week following its global launch. Originally billed as a Lineage sequel, Throne and Liberty is an MMO with PvE and PvP set in a dynamic and seamless world. It suffered numerous delays over the course of a development cycle spanning several years.</p><p>Throne and Liberty finally launched on October 1 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and soon proved a hit on Steam with an impressive player concurrent peak of 336,300. Throne and Liberty remains one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You can buy it now at <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4b6RA?object_uuid=9d9d368e-e3ef-4ad5-98aa-5ad489dc96fc&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bRxl?object_uuid=9d9d368e-e3ef-4ad5-98aa-5ad489dc96fc&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Headlining the changes is improved audio, of course, as the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-headset">gaming headset</a> features support for Dolby Atmos ("now included at no extra cost," Microsoft said), Windows Sonic, and DTS Headphone:X to provide what Xbox called "immersive, spatial audio that brings games to life in vivid detail."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/xboxa-1729609565011.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It also has improved battery life, with Xbox promising up to 20 hours of playtime. The small print makes clear that "battery life varies significantly" depending on distance from the console, additional accessories, usage, and "other factors," however.</p><p>The microphone is upgraded too, with "advanced auto-mute and voice isolation" allowing for clear audio on the other end and the minimization of background noise.</p><p>Finally, the Xbox Wireless Headset has been redesigned to allow for "maximum comfort" thanks to an adjustable headband, plush earcups, and on-ear controls.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-wireless-headset-review">IGN's review of the original Xbox Wireless Headset</a> returned an 8/10, as we said it "delivers a well-rounded audio setup for consoles with some fine flourishes and a few minor flaws." We'll be testing out the new version in the coming weeks to see how it stacks up against the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-headset">best Xbox headsets</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p dir="ltr">It's been over a decade since a new entry in the Killzone series has come out. Judging from comments by a veteran Guerrilla Games developer, don't set expectations for the FPS franchise to return anytime soon. The team "needed" to shake things up after Killzone: Shadow Fall launched in 2013, according to art director Roy Postma.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, Postma explained why Guerrilla left Killzone behind and set their sights on what became Horizon Zero Dawn. "We were done with it as a team. As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette," Postma said.

Did you have a fine old time in Blackreach, the mazy, Dwemer-built underside of Skyrim's sprawling mountain map? Do you like murdering Ents in slow motion? Do you want to see smells? You might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-axis-unseen">The Axis Unseen</a>, which has just launched on Steam - it's the work of former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile, one of the big brains behind Blackreach.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The Axis Unseen isn't an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, nor is it a work of genre fantasy like Elder Scrolls. It's an open world archery hunting sim, set in a "heavy metal horror" universe, with an appropriately loud soundtrack composed by post-metallurgical maestro Clifford Meyer of Red Sparowes fame.
</p>
<p>
The game's monsters can smell you based on the wind direction, and you can track them based on footprints and blood trails. This isn't some pious exercise in realism, however: you also get a sorcerous bow with arrows that can distort time and change the weather. Arrow effects can be combined, Magicka-style, and there are also unlocks that enhance your senses. "See scent particles," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/">the Steam page enthuses</a>. "Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen." I'm not sure my graphics card can handle colours beyond human comprehension, though the system specs don't look too brutal.
</p>
<p>
I played an early build of The Axis Unseen at GDC's Day Of The Devs this year, and swiftly got myself stepped on by Bigfoot. In the 10 minutes or so before I was stepped on by Bigfoot, I particularly enjoyed the game's shamanistic in-world HUD design, with health, power availability and how much noise you're making visible as glowing glyphs on your wrists and equipment. I wasn't especially blown away by the hunting element, but it's hard to form a clear impression of such delicacies when you're surrounded by game developers bellowing about the afterparty. 
</p><p>
The full game is "20 hours long, more if you're a completionist", according to the Steam page. Graham is reviewing this, I think, or at least, putting together some lengthier thoughts about it. He says he's interested because archery is the only good part of Skyrim, but don't mind Graham - he's always saying things like that.

It’s grim, it’s moody, it’s empathetic to the very human atrocities at its dark heart. It is also, blessedly, pretty short by modern standards. Meaning, thankfully, you won’t be spending the entire month trying to clear this thing.</p><p>But, that leaves a big chunk of spooky month remaining, and needless to say, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is a tough act to follow in terms of that exact horror wavelength. Since Christophe Gans is taking his sweet French time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHDUlTa1CQc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHDUlTa1CQc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing <em>Silent Hill 2</em> to the big screen</a></span>, we’re gonna have to methadone it for this Halloween.

And, of course, they’re led by Scorsese’s current favorite, Leo DiCaprio.</p><p>Not, there’s no twitchy leg monsters or Pyramid Heads running around, but there is an unnerving misty island asylum, a mystery concerning a murdered wife, a subterranean netherworld where the truly insane taunt our so-called hero, a damaged nurse repentant for her actions, and one hell of a twist that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> fans will genuinely appreciate. Basically, all the wonderfully fucked-up psychological torment, guilt, shame, and fear that a lot of <em>Silent Hill</em> media gets wrong, Scorsese gets right without breaking a sweat.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-recommend-id="image://a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Possession." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Possession." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Gaumont</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-recommend-id="image://a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Possession." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you could somehow distill pure not-from-concentrate Divorced Guy Energy and pour it onto celluloid, you’d get something that vaguely resembled <em>Possession</em>. It takes a particularly fucked up, jilted mind to take a film about a marriage dissolving to where this goes, to say nothing of how disjointed and coldly malevolent it turns out.</p><p>James Sunderland got off light. His wife getting a wasting disease and becoming an angrier, more hostile version of herself is one thing. Sam Neill’s Mark is married to a woman (Isabelle Adjani) who leaves their young child neglected in an apartment for hours on end, has a random collection of dismembered body parts in a fridge in a separate apartment across town, had what can only be described as a full-body miscarriage in a subway station, and is apparently having the most incredible sex of her life with a murderous tentacle creature. Mark responds by getting involved in seething, violent arguments with her that end in murder and hate sex. Raise your game, Mary Sunderland.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-recommend-id="image://71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1060" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob's Ladder" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob's Ladder" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tri-Star Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-recommend-id="image://71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1060" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob's Ladder" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This one’s mandatory viewing for cinephile <em>Silent Hill</em> fans, since this film’s DNA is all over the games, from the twitchy faces co-opted for the enemy designs, to James Sunderland literally wearing Jacob Singer’s outfit.</p><p>But the connection is less about the aesthetics than the tone. It’s a story existing in the surreal, incomprehensible middle-ground between life and death, where angels and demons both try to tell poor tortured Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) something he can’t or won’t understand through increasingly violent means. The drama seems to drag until it all falls into place later in the film, but even then, just like the best moments in the <em>Silent Hill</em> games, it’s a mood unlike anything else.</p><p>Oh, and in case anyone’s wondering, yes, there was a 2019 remake; yes, it was real bad.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-recommend-id="image://69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->New World Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-recommend-id="image://69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you aren’t ready for the nasty European flavor of psychsexual horror on film, don’t worry, David Cronenberg has you covered. Cronenberg’s also got Divorced Guy Energy going on, but his approach at least has a conversation about mental health and a therapist involved. Granted, therapy involves turning negative emotions and experiences into homicidal toddlers who murder whoever you talked about in the last session, but, y’know, still therapy.</p><p>As much as it is definitely A David Cronenberg Movie, there’s a lot of sadness and empathy for the factors that made Oliver Reed’s wife the way she is, but mostly a hell of a lot of anger. If you’re one of those people who thought the Maria ending was the way to go in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, this should be your jam, because this basically has the same idea.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-recommend-id="image://5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shudder</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-recommend-id="image://5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the things that a lot of old-schoolers—even the ones who generally liked the remake—complained about with Bloober Teams approach to <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is that there’s a certain level of jankiness, graininess, and brokenness about the original game that’s just gone by necessity. There’s something that hits different about staring into a hallway, your light barely even penetrating the darkness, bouncing off of a vague abstraction of a lived-in apartment building or abandoned hospital, as opposed to a lovingly crafted, photoreal rendition of the same. Your mind just meets the abstraction halfway, and if it’s got any semblance of an imagination, it’ll craft terrors for you that Hollywood money can’t buy.</p><p><em>Skinamarink</em> is 100 minutes of that feeling. A film taking its sweet time, stripping away every guard rail of typical horror media. The two children at its center wake up one night to find out their parents have disappeared. Then the doors. Then the windows. Then the lights. And then the shadows start moving. And then there are voices calling the kids upstairs. And mom’s upstairs. but something is breaking her bones. But you never actually <em>see</em> any of this in any discernible sense. Now, that does require a lot of buy-in from the viewer, because a mind that can’t really surrender its imagination like that will just see a 100-minute movie about two kids watching cartoons and yawn. But still. Turn out your lights, turn off your phone, watch this sucker in silence. You might be surprised where it takes you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-recommend-id="image://7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dimension Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-recommend-id="image://7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Is it an obvious choice? Sure. The original novella is the source of the whole conceit of <em>Silent Hill</em> being covered in fog (<em>Half-Life</em> also cribbed its premise from the original novella). It’s also one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made, if not <em>the</em> best, and ‘tis very much the season for that. It’s also got a slew of great performances across the board, including the late, great Andre Brougher. For the strict gamers, Sam Witwer of <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Days Gone</em> fame has a small but important role here. But more than anything, especially the more we watch real life splinter into weird pseudo-religious fiefdoms dealing with the threat of apocalypse with fear and bloodshed, it’s only become a more powerful and prescient piece of work since it was released. Mrs. Carmody is EVERYWHERE now.</p><p>But yes, on top of all of that, it’s also the only place in non-game media to get your fix of that special feeling <em>SH2</em> gives you right from the start, of following something unidentifiable into the mist, and seeing it get swallowed up by unholy terror by the end. Do yourself a favor: Don’t stream it. Buy it on disc, roll with the black &amp; white cut, it’s a very different ride.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The package includes a remaster of 2011’s <em>Sonic Generations</em> and a brand-new campaign starring Shadow the Hedgehog. Y’all, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is the best <em>Sonic </em>game in the past 20 years, and I spent a good 20 hours running around its open zone finding all the collectibles I could. That means I can give you a few pointers on how best to use your time as you try to reach that coveted 100 percent completion. Here are a few things to know before jumping into <em>Shadow Generations</em>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196055,196646" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h11544"><a id=""></a><strong>Consider playing <em>Sonic Generations </em>first</strong></h2><p>This might seem like a wild thing to suggest, but while <em>Shadow Generations </em>is easily the big selling point of the package, the original <em>Sonic Generations </em>is also here and it feels substantially worse to play. However, part of the reason it felt bad to go back to was because I’d just spent 20 hours in <em>Shadow Generations </em>at that point and gotten used to the tightness of its controls. If you want to play both games, it may be worth hopping into <em>Sonic Generations </em>first, just so you don’t have to go back to something that feels a little dated compared to its counterpart. If you never played the original, it’ll also help contextualize <em>Shadow Generations</em>, as Shadow’s story doesn’t do a whole lot to explain what’s going on with the blue blur and all his friends. It will also explain why you don’t actually fight Sonic in the campaign. Just something to consider.</p><h2 id="h11545"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t try and get a perfect run your first time through</strong></h2><p>Having been a high-score hound in previous <em>Sonic </em>games, I’ve always had a bad habit of trying to get a near-perfect run the first time I play through a level. Don’t be like me. If you fall down a hole or lose all your rings, keep running. It’s always fun when you manage to get an S rank the first go around, but if you’re unwilling to move forward until you make that no damage/no restart run, you’re gonna get stuck and waste time you could be spending seeing new levels and story. Come back to a level later. It’ll be there when you get back.</p><h2 id="h11546"><a id=""></a><strong>If you see a machine part, grab it immediately</strong></h2><p>Some of the many collectibles you’ll find in <em>Shadow Generations </em>are bolts, screws, washers, and other mechanical parts lying around the White Space map. If you see one of these, stop what you’re doing and grab it. Even if you’ve gotta run around the map to find the right bouncer to send you flying to it or floating platform to jump across to get to it, these little fuckers are the biggest pain in the ass to find in all of <em>Shadow Generations</em>. Unlike other collectibles that are either on the map or readily visible, these parts are tucked away in the corners of the map and are tiny enough that you might overlook them even from a birds-eye view. There are 80 of them hidden around the world and by the time you reach those last 15 or so, they make themselves real scarce. Don’t risk forgetting where one is, grab it when you see it.</p><figure id="" data-id="231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-recommend-id="image://231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow stands with Maria and Gerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow stands with Maria and Gerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-recommend-id="image://231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow stands with Maria and Gerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h11547"><a id=""></a><strong>Take screenshots of chests you can’t open at the moment</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>Shadow Generations</em> you will unlock treasure chests around the White Space. Most of them are marked on the map; however, I encountered a handful that weren’t labeled for some reason and had to go looking for them. You open these with keys you find in stages and challenge levels, which means you may stumble upon a chest you can’t open until you’ve played a bit further. When this happens, try to screenshot the area or take note of where the chest is in case it’s one that the game, for some reason, doesn’t show on the map.</p><h2 id="h11548"><a id=""></a><strong>Finishing the game will make collecting easier</strong></h2><p>When you’re done with the main story, you’ll still be able to play levels, run around the White Space, and finish filling out your collection. Shadow gains powers throughout the game that let him traverse different parts of the map, and without getting into spoilers, the final ability you acquire is basically an easy mode button for traversal. So while you should absolutely grab items when you see them, just know this power will make collecting items pretty painless.</p><figure id="" data-id="268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-recommend-id="image://268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-recommend-id="image://268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h11549"><a id=""></a><strong>Take the time to read Gerald’s journal</strong></h2><p>One type of collectible you’ll find are pages of Doctor Gerald Robotnik’s journal. This is for the real lore sickos who want a new look at Shadow’s creation, the doctor’s descent into madness, and even a bit of a peek into series antagonist Doctor Eggman’s family drama. You’ll find these pages on balloons floating around the White Space. Shoot them down with a Chaos Spear attack and then you can read them in the collection room accessible from the pause menu.</p><h3 id="h11550"><a id=""></a><strong>Hard mode bosses and challenges count toward the completion percentage</strong></h3><p>As you play through <em>Shadow Generations</em>, you’ll be able to check your completion percentage for all the stages the game has to offer in the Records menu. However, if you notice you’ve done everything but it still doesn’t say you’ve hit 100 percent completion, it might be because the hard mode bosses and challenges count as separate stages from their normal difficulty counterparts. You can fight these bosses by activating Doom Zone from the Black Doom eyeball mechanism across from the Space Colony Ark entrance. </p><hr><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is getting another level later this year based on the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-gerald-trailer-explained-1851632861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-gerald-trailer-explained-1851632861"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>movie</a></span>, with Keanu Reeves set to voice the antihero in the level.

<p>There won’t be a sequel to The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and the team that built the game no longer exists at Ubisoft. According to a new rumor from <a href="https://x.com/gautoz/status/1848742322319548852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">French journalist Gautoz</a>, Ubisoft has disbanded the team behind the game after it failed to reach internal expectations.</p>



<p>A sequel for the game was also pitched, but the company rejected it.</p>







<p>The news was first revealed during Gautoz’s show on the Origami YouTube channel. The show is in French, but a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-team-behind-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-game-did-not-reach-expectations-and-sequel-was-refused.1016355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user from Reset Era</a> summarized the report.</p>



<p>The report claims that a decision about the future of the game was decided “a few weeks after the release”. It was made clear by Ubisoft that after releasing DLC and cosmetics for the game, support would be done. It was also said that members of the core dev team fought for the aforementioned sequel and even more expansions.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s said that Ubisoft didn’t want another game because those higher up in the company because it could “cannibalize” the potential long term sales of the first title.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to multiple sources on the legitimacy of the rumor. Should any new information come in, this article will be updated accordingly. Until then, please take this information with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.glitched.online/the-wolf-among-us-2-reportedly-facing-development-issues-and-possible-cancellation/">whistleblower</a> claimed development of The Wolf Among Us 2 was in peril, and the team at Telltale were at a "critical point where they might have no choice but to shelve it".</p>
<p>Now, in a statement shared with Eurogamer, Telltale has assured us that work on the game continues on.</p>

<p>"As a rule, we don't comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,"  a Telltale PR told us. "But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we're excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right."</p>
<p>The Wolf Among Us 2 - again set in the world of Bill Willingham's Fables comics - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/telltale-announces-the-wolf-among-us-season-two-days-after-telling-fans-not-to-get-hopes-up">originally announced back in 2017</a>, but development halted when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-walking-dead-developer-telltale-games-reportedly-lays-off-the-majority-of-its-staff">Telltale Games faced significant lay-offs, and was shuttered in 2018</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft has generally been met with middling reviews since its launch earlier this month, but Tomb Raider 2013 writer Rhianna Pratchett has called out one particular element for praise.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Pratchett said she had not yet watched the show herself, but had been "glad to hear the series has touched upon Lara's PTSD after her experiences". Pratchett noted this "was an area we weren't allowed to explore in the games", despite the narrative team wanting to do so.</p>

</figure>
<p>Pratchett spoke to me about Lara's PTSD journey last year, when she revealed that she and narrative designer John Stafford had actually pitched "playable nightmares" to Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics. "I had the idea that she could have these scenarios from the first game that had got kind of twisted in her mind," Pratchett told me at the time. Crystal ultimately did not go for this idea.</p><p>In the Tomb Raider animated series, Lara experiences flashbacks and nightmares relating to her time on Yamatai, and the resulting fallout of those close to her, such as Sam. And this brings us on to another thing Pratchett said she appreciated about Netflix's show: that it focuses more on Lara's personal life outside of hunting for artefacts in every corner of the earth.</p>
<p>"Lara's personal life and friendships and how she navigates the real world have always been fun areas to explore beyond the games," Pratchett told me.</p>
<p>"These were areas that both Gail [Simone] and I touched a lot upon in our runs on the Dark Horse comics -  creating scenarios like Sam fighting off someone with a close-combat cupcake, and Lara taking on bad guys in the depths of the London Underground whilst dressed as one of the Bennet sisters," Pratchett continued, reflecting on her work on the Tomb Raider comics.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's silly, or irreverent, or just refreshing, but exploring that blurry line where the hero meets the human is always wonderfully fertile ground."</p>

<p>As for the future, Crystal Dynamics is currently working on a new Tomb Raider entry with Amazon.

		<p>Metal Slug Tactics has got a release date, and that date is November 5th. Dotemu confirmed the news with a brand new trailer, that also revealed three more playable characters. Those characters are the Ikari Warriors, Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern. You can check out the new Metal Slug Tactics trailer below, which shows the characters in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYLtBnTjdvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There has been a bit of a wait for Metal Slug Tactics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/11/metal-slug-tactics-is-a-tactical-rpg-spin-off-from-the-classic-run-and-gun-shooter/">which was first revealed in 2021</a>. In 2022, developer<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/metal-slug-tactics-developer-acquired-by-focus/"> Leikir Studio was acquired by Focus Home Interactive</a>. Later in 2022, there was more news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/12/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-to-2023/">Metal Slug Tactics was going to be delayed to 202</a>3. Obviously, the game did not release in that year either, but at least it is coming out before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Descriptions for the new characters have been released alongside the trailer too, giving a sense of each one’s playstyle:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Clark Still:</b>&nbsp;Originally hailing from the Ikari Warriors series and previously playable in&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Clark’s immense strength and wrestling experience allows this tanklike ally to relocate enemies on the map and dish out wide-reaching, status-inflicting damage.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Ralf Jones:</b>&nbsp;Also returning for battle from the Ikari Warriors series and&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Ralf is a master of short-range combat, packing devastating punches and the ability to charge at enemies head-on like a raging bull.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Leona Heidern:</b>&nbsp;A newer addition to the Ikari Warriors, Leona is a revered fighter capable of replacing fallen enemies with decoy allies; she can distract and overwhelm enemy forces in her distinct approach to dominating the combat zone.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, Metal Slug Tactics is taking things in a bold new direction. It may feature the same heroes, visuals, and imagery of SNKs arcade classics, albeit from a new perspective. We’re suckers for turn-based tactical RPGs here at TheSixthAxis and, beyond the Metal Slug name, we want to see the milieu of customisation and roguelike elements that are at play when Tactics launches on November 5th for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Switch.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shotgun-king-is-roguelike-chess-with-a-shotgun">Shotgun King</a> developers Punkcake Délicieux have quietly rolled out another ticklish oddity in the shape of Build The Sun, a work-in-progress 2D god sim. In Build The Sun you preside over a tribe of alarming yet cute inkblot creatures, who sometimes remind me of Pikmin and sometimes, of that awful 'roided-up panther monster from the opening stretch of Another World. Your objective is, indeed, to build the sun, because there isn't one: the game's pastoral pixelart world is engulfed in darkness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It starts with a single, scurrying inkblot creature, hefting a solitary flame through the shadows. Who lit that first flame? Does this world have a Prometheus? There is no time to ponder, for a helpful arrow ushers you toward a ready-made pile of sticks. 
</p>
<p>
Hold-click on the pile to ignite it (make sure you actually hold till the fire is ablaze, as the current version of the game will crash otherwise). Now, you have a small circle of light that attracts other inkblot creatures. The fire craves growth, as advertised by silhouetted icons for burnable resources when you mouse-over the blaze. These can be obtained by hold-clicking on things like trees and rocks, causing your industrious followers to automatically cluster and nibble the object down to its rudiments.
</p>
<p>
As the fire develops, spilling the light further and further, the game gets more complex. You don't have to burn all the resources you gather; you can use them to construct things like huts and windmills. I'm not sure what these buildings do yet, after 15 minutes with the current build, but I imagine huts increase your population. Everything is left for you to figure out - there's no guidance beyond the silhouetted icons. It appears there's plenty to discover, or at least, that the process of feeding the conflagration is compulsive. Commenters on <a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/build-the-sun">the Itch.io downloads page</a> say they've been tending to their miniature suns for hours.
</p><p>
The current version of Build The Sun is one of many fruits of <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56">Ludum Dare's 56th gamejam</a>. It was made in 72 hours according to the theme "tiny creatures". "We're definitely going to keep working on this one, so you may also consider this version as a very early demo," the devs note. I wish them all the best with it. I have a thing for weird sun-themed games. If you share that fetish, may I also recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a>?

As a high-tech thriller, the game required a musical score that evoked the science of expert intelligence gathering – and that approach began with the opening cinema. While this prologue sequence focused on the news and popular sentiment surrounding events in recent history, I wanted my score to emphasize technology, so I prepared some satellite telemetry and data entry sounds that I could use during composition:</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7l85AXfC--g" height="nullpx" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s see how that worked in the cinema:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIHsygEcsPc" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a somewhat understated use of science sound design, so let’s now check out a more overt example. In the Spyder video game for Apple Arcade, developer Sumo Digital created an over-the-top 1960s spy adventure starring a tiny robotic spider. Creative direction for the sound of this game included a groovy 60s-style spy score and lots of retro futuristic sound design, so I made extra efforts to inject that famously quirky sixties sci-fi audio palette into my musical compositions:</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/gdc-2024-dial-up-the-diegetics-the-animal-kingdom" target="_self">GDC 2024 Dial Up the Diegetics: The Animal Kingdom</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKBMZSvkXZc" height="300px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were lots of opportunities to spotlight this sound design approach in my score for Spyder.

The Fail Factory VR game from Armature Studio dropped players into the roles of interns manning an out-of-control robot assembly line. It was my job to make the situation feel as comedically hectic as possible. So, along with a peppy jazz style, I absolutely jammed my music full of robot factory sound design. Here’s a taste of some of the sound assets I was using in this project – these were meant to give the impression of “electronics run amok.”:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0X1fAqsBg5g" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can see that, unlike the sound effects I used in Spyder and Shattered State, these sounds for Fail Factory are particularly aggressive and strident. Here’s how that worked during gameplay:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyVaH7tp7oA" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Up to this point, we’ve explored sounds of the environment, vocalizations from our animal friends, and the electronic and technical sounds of science – so now let’s move on to the industrial and mechanical side of things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the faintest clicks to the most thunderous clangs, machines provide a wealth of sonic inspiration. So, let’s start small and work our way up!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Industrial and mechanical diegetics">Industrial and mechanical diegetics</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In The Da Vinci Code video game, The Collective and 2K Games adapted the world-famous novel in which a Harvard professor uncovers an ancient mystery by solving intricate puzzles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that there won't be a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>data update for the 2024/25 season ahead of the release of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1848709640751927326" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the two studios say that although they've been "exploring" the possibility of an update for the existing game, implementing such a thing would be a "substantial undertaking" which would divert "critical resources" from&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the studios say it would be impossible to "lift assets" being used in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>and drop them into&nbsp;<em>FM24&nbsp;</em>"without recreating them in full". Since&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>will contain data from the 2024/25 season, the studios would have to recreate that data within&nbsp;<em>FM24</em>'s engine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25-menus.jpg?itok=JicnpJtr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25-menus.jpg?itok=TSbLvbBN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect this screen to show up-to-date info for the 2024/25 season.</figcaption></figure><p>The same logic applies to "the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported", owing to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will sport (no pun intended) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">an entirely new engine</a>.</p>
<p>Updated assets and data would "both be required to obtain licensor approval", Sports Interactive and Sega say, and despite "a good initial response" from many licensors, the work involved seems like it would simply be too much.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date">intended for launch next month</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025">delayed to 2025</a> after what Sports Interactive called a "difficult development cycle".</p>
<p>The game will boast a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">Premier League license</a> for the first time in the series' history, but it will compromise on various <i>Football Manager&nbsp;</i>mainstay features, including Create-a-Club and other core series mechanics.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is now scheduled to launch in March, but since that date is fairly close to the end of the 2024/25 football (sorry, Americans) season, some fans have been asking after a season update for the existing game to tide them over.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like that won't be happening. If you want to see current data, you'll have to wait for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, which is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010715" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/football-manager-25-console/9NQ4K2ZW5HJV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in March 2025, with versions for the Switch and mobile devices to follow after.</p>

First <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">reported in <em>Game File</em></a> and confirmed by Netflix, the streaming company has quietly closed of one of its studios, the first in the three years since the company began its foray into gaming.</p><p>According to <em>Game File</em>, the shuttered studio was known as Blue. In 2022, Netflix announced it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23411684/netflix-cloud-gaming-studio-pc-tv">hired former <em>Overwatch </em>executive producer Chacko Sonny</a> to run the studio. Since then, Blue had brought on a number of game industry veterans with experience working on high profile franchises including<em> Halo </em>and <em>God of War</em>. Reportedly, Blue was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23686693/netflix-joseph-staten-aaa-game-halo-veteran">developing a multi-platform AAA game for an original IP</a> but was closed before the game could be announced or released.</p><p>Netflix has released a steady stream of games on its platform since the beginning of its gaming experiment in 2021. Though it started with a small handful of hyper-casual mobile games, Netflix’s offerings have expanded to include mobile exclusive ports of iconic games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091183/netflix-games-hades-release-date-ios-march"><em>Hades</em></a> its own internally developed exclusives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163281/cozy-grove-camp-spirit-release-date-netflix-gaming"><em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23787249/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-netflix-playstation-switch"><em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</em></a>.</p><p>Netflix has also acquired or spun-up a number of studios to support its gaming pipeline. The most recent additions were a mobile game studio in Helsinki, a new studio in southern California, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>developer Spry Fox. But with the closure of Blue, Netflix’s trend of expansion may be over as well as its grander AAA ambitions.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273820/intuit-ceo-sasan-goodarzi-turbotax-irs-quickbooks-ai-software-decoder-interview"><h2>Intuit asked us to delete part of this Decoder episode</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"><h2>Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275797/ford-mustang-mache-2025-heat-pump-bluecruise-design"><h2>The 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E gets sportier and more affordable</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275970/tesla-cybertruck-range-extender-worse-deal-delay"><h2>Tesla’s Cybertruck range extender just became an even worse deal</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/20/24274915/alien-romulus-vhs-limited-edition-collectible-release-date"><h2>Alien: Romulus is getting a VHS release</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But according to players on Steam and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g8xo92/sh2_remake_game_breaking_bug_in_labyrinth_need_a/" rel="nofollow ">the Silent Hill subreddit</a>, the new update has introduced a game-breaking bug to the Labyrinth level.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake's Biggest Differences</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Labyrinth is an underground maze of hallways located beneath Toluca Prison. Players will bump into several NPCs while exploring it (including Eddie and Angela), and will also be faced with a couple of boss fights. The Labyrinth also contains a few puzzles for players to solve, and these puzzles are where the problem lies. Upon completing a puzzle that involves rotating a cube, the cube will then disintegrate, allowing players to continue their journey. But as of the 1.04 patch, the cube is no longer disintegrating for some players, leaving them unable to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">On the bright side, Konami and Bloober Team are aware of the issue, and the game's developers have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g9ei4w/bloober_are_working_on_the_labyrinth_bug_fix/" rel="nofollow ">added an in-game notification</a> confirming that a fix is on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are aware of an issue some players may encounter after the most recent 1.04 patch released on October the 21st in the Labyrinth level of Silent Hill 2," the announcement reads. "The fix will be released as soon as possible. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience."</p><p dir="ltr">But for players who don't want to wait for an official fix, a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g8xo92/sh2_remake_game_breaking_bug_in_labyrinth_need_a/" rel="nofollow ">post on the game's Steam page</a> lists some possible solutions that range from simply reloading the game to lowering its frame rate. None of them are guaranteed to work, of course, but for now, they're the only solution for players who are eager to continue their trek through Silent Hill's blood-splattered hallways and foggy streets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/microsoft-reveal-upgraded-xbox-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has unveiled an upgraded version of the Xbox Wireless Headset, bringing a handful of key improvements with longer battery life, an upgraded microphone and more.</p>
<p>The new Xbox Wireless Headset is available today for $110 / £100 and regional equivalent pricing – that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/16/xbox-wireless-headset-pre-order-price-release-date-march/">a notable $10 / £5 price jump</a> over the original headset, but there’s actually a good reason for that, as Dolby Atmos is now included without an additional fee (previously an additional £11/$15 purchase)</p>


<p>At a glance, they’re effectively identical to the original headset, just without the Xbox green rims to the ear cups. There’s now a single green nubbin button on the otherwise all-black exterior. Most of the changes have come on the inside, though.</p>
<p>Battery life now gives up to 20 hours of playtime between charges, there’s an upgraded microphone with enhanced auto-mute and voice isolations, and the headset now features Bluetooth 5.3 for connection to PC and mobile devices. Qualcomm S5 Gen 2 tech has also been integrated for lower latency.</p>
<p>As mentioned, premium spatial audio is no longer an additional purchase, with Windows Sonic still a freebie, Dolby Atmos now included at no extra cost, and support for DTS Headphone:X, which is still a separate purchase.</p>

<p>The original Xbox Wireless Headset launched in 2021, and was an immediate favourite of ours – some disliked the audio balance and got to tweaking the output, but it worked perfectly for us. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/xbox-wireless-headset-review/">our 2021 headset review</a>, Dom said, “The Xbox Wireless Headset is a remarkable feat of engineering, providing a smart and solid build as well as top-notch audio and comfort that are a rare commodity at this price point.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this one’s even better.</p>
