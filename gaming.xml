There only appears to be one version of the PS5 Pro. </p><h2 id="h172666"><a id=""></a>What do I get for that price? </h2><p>The PS5 Pro includes a 2TB SSD, a DualSense controller, a digital copy of <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, and of course, the new console.</p><h2 id="h172667"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I pre-order it now?</strong></h2><p>Not yet! But Sony says pre-orders will go live on September 26. </p><h2 id="h172668"><a id=""></a>Wait, there was a presentation about the PS5 Pro? Can I watch it still?</h2><p>Yes. Here you go. It’s about 9 minutes long. Enjoy. </p><h2 id="h172669"><a id=""></a><strong>How powerful is it?</strong></h2><p>Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5, claims it’s the most powerful PlayStation console ever made. It features 28% more RAM, and a more powerful GPU with 67% more Compute Units. In the presentation, Sony says this will lead to 45% faster rendering.</p><h2 id="h172670"><a id=""></a><strong>What New Features Does It Have?</strong></h2><p>The PS5 Pro will support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution AI upscaling. This is basically Sony’s spin on AMD’s FSR and Nvidia’s DLSS upscaling tech and will be exclusive to PS5. </p><p>In theory, this should let you run games at higher framerates without having to sacrifice high-end visual settings. It will also include WiFi 7.</p><h2 id="h172671"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it still look kinda silly like the OG PS5?</strong></h2><p>Yeah... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-ps5-does-not-look-good-1844002748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-ps5-does-not-look-good-1844002748">it still looks bulbous and a bit odd</a></span>. But now it has some extra stripes. I assume this helps it go faster. </p><figure id="" data-id="a83ee66c1831f1e02a8bcc0e21983d89" data-recommend-id="image://a83ee66c1831f1e02a8bcc0e21983d89" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a83ee66c1831f1e02a8bcc0e21983d89" data-recommend-id="image://a83ee66c1831f1e02a8bcc0e21983d89" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h172672"><a id=""></a>Is the PS5 Pro digital only? </h2><p>Yes. At least, it is unless you add on a separately purchased disc drive. </p><h2 id="h172673"><a id=""></a>Does PS5 Pro support 8K?</h2><p>Yes! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a blog post published by Sony after the presentation</a></span>, the company confirmed its upcoming console will support 8K and VRR, like the PS5 technically does. (But basically, no games support 8K...yet.) </p><h2 id="h172674"><a id=""></a><strong>What games are getting PS5 Pro upgrades?</strong></h2><p>According to PlayStation, a lot of games will see performance and visual boosts on PS5 Pro. We saw <em>Last of Us Part 2, Ratchet And Clank: Rift Apart,</em> and <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>running better and looking nicer during the short video. </p><p>Sony also listed a number of games that will receive updates to become “PS5 Pro Enhanced” including: <em> Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Demon’s Souls, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Forbidden West, The Crew Motorfest, </em>and <em>The First Descendant.</em><br></p><p>Additionally, the company says “8,500 backward compatible PS4 games” will see performance boosts on PS5 Pro, too. </p><h2 id="h172675"><a id=""></a><strong>Will there be PS5-Pro-only games?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>No mention of that during the video or in the blog. I’d say its unlikely. The PS4 Pro never got exclusive games. This isn’t a new console, just a more powerful PS5. </p><h2 id="h172676"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it support my current PS5 controllers and accessories? </strong></h2><p>Yup! Sony says PS5 Pro will support all accessories currently available. </p><h2 id="h172677"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need a PS5 Pro?</strong></h2><p>Do you care about raytraced reflections, higher-quality shadows, 60 fps, and improved draw distances? If not, then you can probably just continue to enjoy your PS5 and not worry about this upgraded machine. </p><h2 id="h172678"><a id=""></a><strong> Is this a PS6?</strong></h2><p>No, but it does make me worry about how much <em>that thing </em>will cost in a few years...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s essentially a Burned state that also makes them susceptible to taking increased damage. His kit allows him to inflict it quite often, which will help the rest of your team in battle. From Light Cones to Relics, here’s everything you need to know to build out this new character.</p><h2 id="h2136"><a id=""></a>Best Jiaoqiu team composition</h2><figure id="" data-id="191497b5d816799c2fcf9ca9941cdb03" data-recommend-id="image://191497b5d816799c2fcf9ca9941cdb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="191497b5d816799c2fcf9ca9941cdb03" data-recommend-id="image://191497b5d816799c2fcf9ca9941cdb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jiaoqiu’s lower damage output means he plays the role of a Debuff Support better than a DPS. You’ll want to use him with characters that can best take advantage of his debuffs, such as a Nihility DPS or general DoT-based teams.</p><p><strong>Archeron is arguably the best character to be supported by Jiaoqiu.</strong> Not only can his status as a fellow Nihility character satisfy her bonus ability, but his constant barrage of debuffs will help build up her Slashed Dream stacks. Other Nihility DPS that can add on to other DoTs, such as Kafka, will also benefit.<br></p><p><strong>Sparkle and Asta can be wonderful choices if you’re looking to use him with another Support.</strong> The former is better used when the team has one main DPS. Jiaoqiu should rarely be using his Basic Attack anyway, so the extra skill points from Sparkle will come in handy too. Asta, on the other hand, is more flexible, with her buffs helping any team take advantage of Jiaoqiu’s debuffs. Her Fire DMG-increasing bonus ability doesn’t just benefit DPS like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899">Firefly</a></span> either, since the DoT from Ashen Roast will enjoy the advantages too. </p><p>  <strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899">The Best Firefly Build in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a></span></p><p>  <strong>Anyone who can heal should round out the team, but Huohuo and Gallagher stand out the most.</strong> Huohuo’s ultimate is incredibly useful as it regenerates energy and boosts the team’s ATK stats. The debuffs Gallagher can inflict with the Besotted state and his enhanced attack will pair nicely with what Jiaoqiu is capable of. </p><h2 id="h2137"><a id=""></a>Best Jiaoqiu Light Cones</h2><figure id="" data-id="21097c3aaa3a0fbd6a39b8ab50ab34f9" data-recommend-id="image://21097c3aaa3a0fbd6a39b8ab50ab34f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Light Cone screen displays a card named Those Many Springs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Light Cone screen displays a card named Those Many Springs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21097c3aaa3a0fbd6a39b8ab50ab34f9" data-recommend-id="image://21097c3aaa3a0fbd6a39b8ab50ab34f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Light Cone screen displays a card named Those Many Springs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Depending on how you want Jiaoqiu to support your team, you can equip him with a variety of different light cones. Priority is best given to any that increase his Effect Hit Rate so that he can more consistently apply his Ashen Roast debuff.<br></p><p> 5-star <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> characters always benefit the most from the 5-star Light Cones that run alongside their banner. In Jiaoqiu’s case, <strong>Those Many Springs</strong> is the ideal choice. It provides a massive buff to Effect Hit Rate and allows him to apply additional debuffs that increase the damage taken by enemies. </p><p>Two more excellent 5-star options are <strong>Incessant Rain</strong> and <strong>Reforged Remembrance</strong>, which are the limited-time Light Cones available alongside Silver Wolf and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-black-swan-light-cone-relic-team-build-1851238822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-black-swan-light-cone-relic-team-build-1851238822">Black Swan</a></span>. Both contribute an increased Effect Hit Rate and buffs to damage. You’ll need a team that can dish out multiple debuff types to make the best use of their additional benefits though.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-black-swan-light-cone-relic-team-build-1851238822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-black-swan-light-cone-relic-team-build-1851238822">The Best Build for Black Swan, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>’s Mysterious Soothsayer</a></span></p><p> Onto the more accessible 4-star choices, I recommend <strong>Eyes of the Prey</strong> and <strong>Resolution Shines As Pearls of Sweat</strong>. The former provides simple buffs to both Effect Hit Rate and DoT, while the latter can inflict a debuff on enemies that will lower their DEF. </p><h2 id="h2138"><a id=""></a>Which Traces to prioritize</h2><p>Playing Jiaoqiu revolves around stacking his Ashen Roast debuff as consistently as possible. Managing this can feel a little difficult at times, but focusing on certain traces will make it far easier. These are the best ones to invest in.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Quarter Finesse, Octave Finery – Upgrading his talent will increase how much DMG enemies will receive thanks to the Ashen Roast stacks. Considering that this debuff is the core of his strategy, it’s vital to prioritize this trace.</li><li>Pyrograph Arcanum – Nearly as important as Jiaoqiu’s talent is his Ultimate. Upgrading this trace will increase the initial DMG dealt by the attack, along with the increases to general Ultimate DMG and the chance of applying Ashen Roast while the zone is active.</li><li>Seared Scent – This bonus ability is the perfect addition to his Ultimate. Any enemies that enter combat while the Zone is active will have Ashen Roast stacks applied to them, equal to the highest amount on the field.</li></ul><h2 id="h2139"><a id=""></a>Best Jiaoqiu Relic Sets</h2><figure id="" data-id="acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-recommend-id="image://acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two full relic and planar ornament sets displayed on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two full relic and planar ornament sets displayed on the Relics screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-recommend-id="image://acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two full relic and planar ornament sets displayed on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finding the right relics for Jiaoqiu isn’t as obvious as it is for other characters. It will all come down to what kind of team you’re placing him on. Even then, you’ll likely need to mix and match with different sets to make for the best build. Here are the ideal Relic and Planar Ornament sets to enhance Jiaoqiu.&nbsp;</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Prisoner in Deep Confinement is a great choice if you want to increase Jiaoqiu’s damage output. Having two pieces increases ATK by 12 percent, while four pieces will ignore enemy DEF depending on how many DoTs they have. The only caveat is that the four-piece effect will be more efficient if your team can inflict up to three DoT debuffs on enemies.</li><li>Messenger Traversing Hackerspace can be a huge help if you need him to move a bit faster. The two-piece effect increases SPD by 6 percent, which is beneficial as a Support character. You likely won’t get as much use from the four-piece effect, so I recommend pairing this with the previously mentioned Prisoner in Deep Confinement.</li><li>Sprightly Vonwacq is a fantastic Planar Ornament set to equip. It increases Energy Regen by 5 percent and will boost Jiaoqiu’s action at the beginning of the battle if his SPD stat is 120 or higher. Having him go first at the start of every battle is ideal so that he can set up his debuffs.</li></ul><p>Few <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> characters are capable of overwhelming enemies the way Jiaoqiu can. The abundance of debuffs he can offload is the perfect setup for other characters to take advantage of. If you enjoy melting your opponents with stacks of debuffs and DoT, Jiaoqiu is a satisfying Support for your teams. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is primarily emphasized by her talent, which increases the maximum number of usable skill points, and her ultimate, which recovers skill points for the team. Both of these, in addition to her talent ability, increase ally DMG. Whether you’ve only just managed to unlock Sparkle through her banner’s rerun, or need a refresher on how to use her more efficiently, here are my build guidelines for this excellent support.<br></p><h2 id="h2056"><a id=""></a>Best Sparkle team composition</h2><figure id="" data-id="9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-recommend-id="image://9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-recommend-id="image://9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> If you have teams, or even a single character that can easily hog skill points, Sparkle can make a difference. You’ll get the most bang for your buck by using her on a team with other Quantum characters, thanks to one of her bonus abilities that increases their ATK. Nevertheless, she’ll shine no matter who she’s paired with. </p><p>  <strong>Two DPS Quantum characters that will reap the most benefits are Seele and Qingque.</strong> Both can become real powerhouses with all the different DMG and ATK buffs. The extra skill points can also help Seele land her skill ability more often, and let Qingque search more often for matching tiles with her skill. I will concede that not being able to find a matching tile after spending additional points is one of the most disappointing feelings I’ve had while playing though.</p><p><strong>When it comes to DPS characters of different types, Acheron and Imbibitor Lunae certainly come to mind.</strong> Acheron will make great use of the buffs and benefit from being advanced forward by Sparkle’s skill. The recently released Jiaoqiu is also a great secondary Support for an Acheron-centered team. Imbibitor Lunae will benefit for the above reasons, on top of being able to burn through skill points to deal more damage. </p><p>  <strong>Lynx and Fu Xuan are the optimal choices for your healer role.</strong> Extra skill points will ensure Lynx can heal far more often. Fu Xuan doesn’t need to use her skill that much, which means the rest of your team will have plenty of points available. They’ll each be able to trigger Sparkle’s Bonus ability to buff Quantum characters as well, which is great news if you have a DPS of the same type. </p><h2 id="h2057"><a id=""></a>Best Sparkle Light Cones</h2><figure id="" data-id="bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-recommend-id="image://bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called Past and Future is shown on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A card called Past and Future is shown on the Light Cone screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-recommend-id="image://bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called Past and Future is shown on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are quite a few Light Cone options for Sparkle, but the most effective are those that support other characters. Here are the top choices to make her an even bigger asset.</p><p><strong>Earthly Escapade</strong> is the 5-star light cone that runs alongside Sparkle’s banner, and just like other 5-star characters such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557">Yunli</a></span>, the related light cone is the best choice. What makes Earthly Escapade a standout is that it provides huge buffs to Crit Rate and Crit DMG.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557">Master Counters With the Best Yunli Build for <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a></span></p><p>The next best option is the 5-star light cone, <strong>The Battle Isn’t Over</strong>. It will increase energy regen for the wearer and regenerate a skill point whenever they use their ultimate. More importantly, the next ally after Sparkle uses her skill will deal more damage for one turn. This pairs nicely with her skill which will advance the ally that she chooses. The only caveat here is that this is Bronya’s featured light cone, so you might be waiting a while to get it.</p><p>If you want a more accessible version of the above light cone, <strong>Past and Future</strong> is a wonderful alternative. The simple thing it does is increase the next ally’s damage after the wearer uses their skill. It’s not as strong of a buff, but it’s easier to gather these from the Forgotten Hall than it is to hope RNG is on your side for a limited-time item.<br></p><h2 id="h2058"><a id=""></a>Which Traces to prioritize</h2><p>Everything in Sparkle’s kit is helpful, but some aspects are better prioritized than others. Here are the Traces to look out for when you’re upgrading.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Red Herring – Upgrading her talent will increase how much the team-wide damage buff will be whenever an ally uses a skill point. Considering how skill-heavy most Sparkle teams are, this ability will constantly be in play and should be upgraded</li><li>The Hero with a Thousand Faces – While you can’t improve how many skill points are recovered, upgrading Sparkle’s ultimate does affect the additional DMG boost to her talent. Both of these should be upgraded together</li><li>Artificial Flower – This bonus ability extends Sparkle’s Crit DMG buff until the start of the ally’s next turn. On paper, this doesn’t sound too impressive, but it can help with any awkward timing issues, depending on everyone’s SPD stat</li><li>Nocturne – If you’re building a mono-Quantum team, this is a necessary bonus ability. The base 15 percent ATK increase for all allies is great already, but it goes further by boosting Quantum characters’ ATK by 5-30 percent depending on how many are on the team</li></ul><h2 id="h2059"><a id=""></a>Best Sparkle Relic Sets</h2><figure id="" data-id="ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-recommend-id="image://ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1047" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Relics screen for Sparkle with full relic and planar ornament sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Relics screen for Sparkle with full relic and planar ornament sets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-recommend-id="image://ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1047" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Relics screen for Sparkle with full relic and planar ornament sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Equipping the best Relic and Planar Ornament sets isn’t too difficult. All you have to keep in mind is that Sparkle needs to be fast, and needs to increase ally DMG. I’ve listed the preferred options below.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Messenger Traversing Hackerspace is a must-have for nearly every build. The 6 percent SPD increase is solid, and the four-piece effect can boost the entire team’s SPD further by 12 percent. Sparkle is just plain better with these relics</li><li>If you don’t care about team SPD, then Musketeer of Wild Wheat is a decent alternative. Its two-piece effect increases ATK by 12 percent while the four-piece increases SPD by 6 percent and Basic ATK by 10 percent</li><li>Broken Keel can fit in perfectly as long as a particular stat is high enough. The first part of the planar ornament increases the wearer’s effect RES by 10 percent. If this stat reaches the minimum of 30 percent, the whole team will enjoy a 10 percent increase in Crit DMG. Sparkle’s skill will buff a selected ally’s Crit DMG based on a percentage of her own, meaning this ornament can make the skill far more deadly</li></ul><p>Sparkle might have taken six months to return, but she’s easily still one of the best Support characters in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. Her utility is second only to Ruan Mei, and even that might be arguable depending on what kind of teams you prefer. Unless her banner rerun goes against a character that completely changes the game, I can’t imagine a better use for your Stellar Jade and Star Rail Special Passes. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In general, rather than draw you toward a game, their main use is to warn you off one. And generally, when I see the words “precision platformer,” I know it’s not for me. I love platforming, but I hate being punished for every imperfection—just let me be.

It’s a platform game that’s inherently extremely silly, and embraces that with a series of challenging screens that don’t feel any need to judge or punish when you mess up. This is largely because you’re playing a knight who can only move by swinging his sword.</p><p>This means that if you want to move to your right, you need to swipe at the ground to your left. This propels you against the force of your swing, bouncing you in the opposite direction. Using this, with a combination of powerful swings and littler ones, you need to negotiate your way through a world of ledges and platforms, littered with spikes and obstacles that’ll shatter you on contact. Why? Because you’re on your way to a barbecue, of course.<br></p><p>Failure comes often, but a split-second instant restart means you’re not left staring at a “GAME OVER” or frustrated by the game’s gloating. Instead you’re already having another try, then feeling enormously satisfied as you time things just right, so you leap over the gap, whack the spikes with your sword to propel upward, and then give a tiny tap to the right to reach a platform.</p><figure id="" data-id="504a43a440eaf6feb933e0666662a645" data-recommend-id="image://504a43a440eaf6feb933e0666662a645" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The opening screen of the game, in which you're invited to a barbeque." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The opening screen of the game, in which you're invited to a barbeque." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Brynjar Á, Sindri H / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="504a43a440eaf6feb933e0666662a645" data-recommend-id="image://504a43a440eaf6feb933e0666662a645" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The opening screen of the game, in which you're invited to a barbeque." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>None of this would work if it weren’t precisely programmed, as any little issues or blips would have broken the fun. But developers Brynjar Á and Sindri H, both 19 years old, have absolutely nailed it. Movement is natural and satisfying, no matter how daft it is in conception. The main advice I have to anyone getting frustrated is <em>swing earlier</em>. With that understood, it all begins to flow.<br></p><p>It’s fascinating how hard my brain fought against the game. Pulling the analogue stick in the opposite direction that you want to move is obviously tricky to get used to, and then ever-more-so when you’re trying to wall-bounce up a shaft, before sproinging onto a temporary platform in order to bounce off a spike, and so on. But most bizarre was how any time I landed on a safe, flat piece of ground, I would immediately try to just run left or right, despite this at no point being a game that ever lets you do that. The whole thing is an exercise in rebelling against your instincts.</p><p>I’d say there’s a solid hour here if you’re rubbish like me, and probably less than half an hour for people who breeze through games like <em>Celeste</em>. But even though at one point I got a WhatsApp from my wife downstairs asking “Are you ok?” (to which I replied, “Yes, shhhhhhhhh.”), it never crossed from feeling frustrated with myself to feeling frustrated with the game. Oh, and I finished it! I don’t know if that means it’s too easy, or if I’m finally getting better at this sort of thing. I’d assume the former.</p><p>Wondering why something quite so good was quite so free of charge, I got in touch with the Icelandic developers. Brynjar and his development partner Sindri made this game in a gap year between finishing high school and starting college. They were already working on their biggest project yet (“I mean more than a month long”), when they were inspired by a side-effect of a mechanic they saw in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV0s442AbMQ&amp;t=9s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV0s442AbMQ&amp;t=9s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara Spalding video</a></span>, and thought it was underused in her game.</p><figure id="" data-id="d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-recommend-id="image://d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-format="jpg" data-width="2132" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bucolic opening scene, before you attempt any platforms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bucolic opening scene, before you attempt any platforms." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Brynjar Á, Sindri H / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-recommend-id="image://d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-format="jpg" data-width="2132" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bucolic opening scene, before you attempt any platforms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“As soon as I saw it,” Brynjar told me by email, “I thought to myself that you could make an entire game out of just that mechanic alone, you wouldn’t even need to walk! Which was a very interesting and appealing idea to me, a platformer without walking.”</p><p>When he realized Spalding’s game wasn’t using the conceit itself, he was inspired to do it himself. “At around 3 a.m., fueled by a spark of inspiration, sleep deprivation and frustration from the underutilisation of the mechanic, I jumped into Godot and prototyped my idea,” Brynjar continues, “making the recoil bounce and adding controller support. And to my surprise it was very fun, even with just an empty level with some blocks scattered around.”</p><p>Recognizing that his art skills weren’t up to the project, he teamed up with Sindri, the two teenagers finishing the project before starting college a few weeks ago—where the pair are studying game development and VFX.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3030210/SlashJump/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3030210/SlashJump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Slash/Jump</em> is completely free</a></span> via Steam and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://brynkilius.itch.io/slashjump&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://brynkilius.itch.io/slashjump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch</a></span>, and well worth your time.

This particular feat of strength happened on Diablo 4's current test server, where Blizzard is testing out the game's numerous patch 2.0 changes that will launch alongside its upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXXuWP6hkOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SXXuWP6hkOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, part of the 2.0 update is tailored around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-may-have-players-deal-less-damage-and-that-could-be-good/1100-6525197/" data-ref-id="1100-6525197">reducing player levels and scaling down many of the numbers in the game</a> to make them more readable. As Rob2628 has shown, that doesn't look to be going exactly to plan, though they are quick to point out that the absurdly high damage numbers they achieved seem to be thanks to a bug--one that will almost certainly be fixed prior to the 2.0 update's official release.</p><p dir="ltr">To achieve the feat, Rob2628 stacked gear with Thorns and Maximum Life, took advantage of the Barbarian's new Thorns-focused Key Passive Barbed Carapace (which grants more Thorns as a player continues to attack), and managed to gain 31 ranks of the Tough as Nails passive skill (which increases Thorns damage and has a chance to cause enemies to take additional bleed damage).</p><p dir="ltr">Rob2628 also took advantage of two of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">Runewords being introduced in Vessel of Hatred</a>: one that gives them more life (and thus more Thorns) and one that creates an earthquake while standing still. All the while Rob2628's Barbarian continues to use their high amount of attack speed and Fury generation to use the Barbarian's Whirlwind ability without stopping, making sure the Thorn damage continues to scale to higher and higher heights until it eventually surpasses the amount of damage the game can display. He defeats the game's greatest challenge, a boss on Tier 100 of the Pit, in an instant.</p><p dir="ltr">"This can pretty much speed-farm everything in the game, obviously, because we have infinite damage," Rob2628 said in a video breaking down the accomplishment.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's 2.0 update and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred expansion releases on October 8</a>.

Fresh off its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PlayStation 5 Pro reveal</a>, Sony has reportedly confirmed "about 40 or 50 or games" will get PS5 Pro upgrade patches when the console launches on 7th November.
</p>
<p>
That nugget of information comes via a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/">report from CNET</a>, which chatted with PlayStation's lead system architect Mark Cerny ahead of today's PS5 Pro reveal. So far, Sony has only officially named 13 games set to recieve PS5 Pro upgrades on launch day, meaning there's still plenty more to be shared. Those game, incidentally, are as follows:

<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon's Souls</li>

<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered </li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of those freshly enhanced titles got an airing during today's PS5 Pro reveal, with announced upgrades ranging from a fidelity mode frame rate boost from 30fps to 60fps for numerous titles - including The Last of Us Part 2, Marvel's Spider-man 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> - alongside more substantial enhancements elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, for instance, will gain ray tracing reflections between cars during gameplay on PS5 Pro, all while still targeting 60fps, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> is getting an upgrade with improvements to lighting and visual effects, as well as enhanced hair and skin in cinematics. One game not mentioned in Sony's annoucement but shown to CNET during its demo is EA's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">F1 24</a>, which will reportedly also recieve new ray tracing effects during races.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Sony is yet to announce enhancements for any of its PSVR 2 titles, which is unlikely to instil confidence in fans worried about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">what feels like an increasingly neglected platform</a>. But Mark Cerny did at least note to CNET that higher-resolution games will be possible on PSVR 2 thanks to PS5 Pro's GPU boost and owners can "eventually" expect a "tuning of Sony's AI upscaling that will work with all VR games".
</p>
<p>
The digital-only PS5 Pro launches on 7th November and will cost £699.99/$699.99. It'll include a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller, and - just like the PS5 - a pre-installed copy of Astro's Playroom. A vertical stand will be sold separately for £24.99, and the console is compatible with Sony's £99.99 disc drive add-on.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2.977124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since the PlayStation 5 Pro specs were leaked, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) was arguably the most interesting new feature. Yes, the additional Compute Units, faster memory, and improved ray tracing capabilities are great, but Sony has also developed a custom AI upscaling feature, which is probably going to be critical in delivering high frame rates while keeping the ray traced effects in place.</p>
<p>Now that everything has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, CNET <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> some interesting news as part of their exclusive hands-on with PS5 Pro. According to the outlet, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution has been confirmed to work across the full library without game developers having to release a specific PS5 Pro patch. If that was the case, it'd be a big selling point for all those fans still on the fence after learning of the hefty price tag ($699, £699, €799) of the console.</p>
<p>However, the PlayStation 5 Pro's reveal trailer actually says something different when the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution feature is mentioned on the screen:</p>
<p><em>Feature only available on select PS5 games that have been enhanced for PS5 Pro.</em></p>
<p>We have asked Sony to clarify whether CNET's info is correct and will update the story if we hear back. Meanwhile, CNET also learned from Lead System Architect Mark Cerny that PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution will eventually work on PS VR2 games, which would be great as well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ps5pro-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Furthermore, Cerny shared some interesting statements with CNET about Sony's latest console, which will launch globally on November 7.</p>
<p><em>I've already seen games with three different PS5 Pro modes. As time goes by, particularly for the games which are launching after the hardware releases, we'll increasingly see a more nuanced approach, where the focus is less on resolution, and much more about higher image quality through a variety of strategies.</em></p>
<p><em>PS5 Pro uses the new advanced ray tracing feature sets that AMD created as the next step in their roadmap architecture But if you look around, there are no other AMD GPUs that use it yet. We motivated the development, and I'm very happy we did so -- the response from the developers has been extraordinarily great.</em></p>
<p>Are you planning to get the PS5 Pro at launch? Let us know below.</p>

The trailer gives players an in-depth look at his abilities and moveset, as well as the story that will coincide with his appearance in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and the re-imagined universe of the game.</p>
<p>The trailer is just over three minutes long and expands on Liu Kang's New Era with a new story campaign showcasing Liu Kang's champions as they work together to battle Titan Havik, who wants to destroy the realms as they know it. Below is the three-minute trailer where you can see Noob Saibot in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns – Official Noob Saibot Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jb-HBuF5XsQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this re-imaged universe, Liu Kang is the Fire God and is in his New Era, and stole Bi-Han's soul to create Noob Saibot. In the original timeline, Bi-Han became Sub-Zero and was Lin Kuei's Grandmaster who wanted to make his clan a dominant force. However, now as Noob Saibot, Bi-Han is dedicated to eradicating all forms of authority.</p>
<p>The trailer showcases Noob Saibot's aggressive moveset, where he can use teleportation to slam his opponents down, as well as using spectral projectiles that can detonate after attaching to his opponents. He can also use a multitude of shadow-assisted attacks to damage his foes. With Animalities making a return to the game, the trailer for Noob Saibot also shows off a glimpse of his Animality, where he can transform into a crocodile to destroy his opponent.</p>
<p>While most of the content in the trailer for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns is paid, Animalities will be available as a free update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners on September 24, the day of the release.</p>
<p>The new expansion will be released on September 24, introducing six new playable characters: Cyrax, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-gets-new-trailer-for-sektor/">Sektor</a>, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, T-1000 and Conan the Barbarian. Additionally, there will be new Story mode chapters which will be available on release date so that players can get up to date on the lore of this re-imagined universe. The expansion will be released at 4 PM BST / 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those who have pre-ordered the new expansion will receive four new character skins, which include Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena and Klassic Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Sub-Zero, and Noob Saibot, all of which will be available on release day.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/satisfactory-review-in-progress.977115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This has been a hard review to write. Not because I don't know what to say, but because every time I dip back into Satisfactory to look up an item name or confirm some detail, I find myself checking in on the state of my workshop, just for a moment, and then several hours have suddenly flown by. That’s the magic of this seemingly benign, inexplicably alluring factory simulator. Whether I’m pulling my hair out trying to troubleshoot a problem on the factory floor or running away from very disrespectful fireball-spitting aliens, every moment spent in this beautifully complex simulator has been worthwhile. Combining the creativity and exploration of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review">Minecraft</a> with the spreadsheet-inducing planning and optimization of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/factorio-review">Factorio</a>, Satisfactory is not only the best game I’ve played this year, but my favorite automation game of all time – and that’s without even having reached its final engineering challenges after going <em>hard </em>on a fresh world in its 1.0 build for more than 90 hours. Unless the final stretch of leveling up my factory takes an unexpectedly nightmarish turn for the worse, so far Satisfactory has been an unbelievably good time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Satisfactory Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Satisfactory is an immediately compelling factory simulator where you and up to three friends are dropped on an alien planet and told you need to establish a base and produce increasingly complicated materials and launch them into outer space to appease your boss. In order to do so, you’ll need to harvest natural resources, develop new technologies, and become a master of conveyor belts, pipelines, and eventually even locomotive operations as you triumphantly grow your tiny headquarters into a planet-encompassing labyrinth of moving parts. More and more is asked of you as you go, and what starts out as a simple process of gathering leaves and mining iron to make basic tools quickly spirals into a convoluted whirlwind of refineries, manufacturing plants, and nuclear power grids, where you’re producing everything from computer chips to rocket fuel. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each breakthrough moment organically leads to the next mountain to climb.</p></div><p>If you're wondering how in the heck assembly line optimization could possibly be fun, I understand your confusion. But in the same way that something like No Man’s Sky gives you a ton of creative freedom while providing irresistible goals to chase along the way, Satisfactory never stops giving you exciting new reasons to keep playing I cannot fathom the number of times I promised myself I’d log off after I tweaked <em>just one more thing</em> only to find myself still tinkering away hours later. Each breakthrough moment, like figuring out how oil refineries work and starting the production of plastic, organically leads to the next mountain to climb, like crafting a rifle and producing ammo with the byproducts of said refineries. Before you know it, you hear those alarming morning chirps from birds outside your window and realize you’ve made a mistake.</p><p>Managing ever more complex factories can be pretty daunting at times, but Satisfactory does an absolutely stellar job of nudging you to take small, manageable steps with its checklist of projects to tackle, and in no time at all you and your friends are managing sprawling operations that would have seemed unfathomable at the start. The earliest factory I built began as a few buildings scattered about the untainted wilderness, which quickly spiraled into a horrendous and disorderly web of nonsensically crisscrossing conveyor belts that looked like a bowl of wet noodles (naturally, I dubbed the settlement Spaghettysburg). That amateurish anarchy might be unintuitive and less than optimal, but hey, it gets the job done, and I victoriously delivered my eminent Spaghettysburg address to my co-op partners as we launched the fruits of our labor into space amid the mess of mechanical pasta. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The real fun is in watching your mini society evolve.</p></div><p>Later on, my crew’s creations became more structured and efficient, like our coastal oil refinery dubbed Gas Town or our railway system, which we suspended in the air for maximum orderliness. The real fun is in watching your mini society evolve as you solve progressively more difficult engineering challenges, such as optimizing and expanding your power grid to fuel more facilities so you can produce more complicated parts, or running the math on the ideal ore output of a mining rig to figure out the most efficient way to smelt it into ingots. And you don't have to be a spreadsheet geek like me or dive deep into third-party wikis to simply see a conveyor belt full of unused materials backing up and feel the irresistible urge to do something about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As you’re required to make dozens of different components and juggle a large number of demanding processes in order to complete the Milestone deliveries that make up Satisfactory's larger progression, you’re constantly switching to wherever your attention is needed most, solving problems and using the new technology you create along the way to make your life easier. For example, early on, I built comically long conveyor belts to move resources from other parts of the world to my main factory, but after unlocking new technologies and manufacturing more advanced parts, I was able to automatically transport resources with trucks, trains, and even flying drones, making things faster, cleaner, and frankly, less chaotic in the process. Going from an unwashed, melee-swinging, conveyor belt-abusing troglodyte to a jetpacking, gun-toting man of tomorrow is immensely satisfying, and makes each hard-fought battle of electrical wiring well worth the trouble.</p><p>When you’re not juggling the hundreds of things to do with your factory operations, you’ll take to the vast open world to explore the map, battle beasties, evade poison gas and irradiated zones, find hidden treasures, and befriend gross-looking lizard doggos to serve as your loyal companions. Opting for a single, hand-crafted world instead of the more common procedurally generated areas found in some of its peers, Satisfactory’s map has a diverse set of regions with their own vibes and valuable resources to plunder that are awesome to explore and even better to colonize with your hungry machines. As you gain access to new tools, you’ll get better equipment to take out into exploration, which then gives you access to even more areas. For example, crafting a gas mask lets you navigate zones overrun with poisonous clouds, unlocking the jetpack allows you scale cliffs that would otherwise be difficult to reach, and researching explosives allows you to blast through troublesome rocks so you can delve into caves and other blocked off areas. Each of these developments completely changes what’s possible while out in the world, which in turn allows you to acquire better materials to bring back to your base, creating a loop of building and exploration that just doesn’t quit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It goes from great to downright amazing once you add friends.</p></div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be much of an alien planet if there weren't hostile creatures everywhere who are quite interested in seeing your violent demise. You’ll unlock a few melee weapons and some basic guns and ammo, but combat isn’t anything special as it clearly isn’t the intended focus of Satisfactory. It only took me a few hours before I realized I’d seen just about everything combat had to offer, and while it’s not actively bad, it’s just a bit forgettable when the building and exploration are so great. The alien wildlife mostly seems to be there to provide a touch of danger whenever I go looking for new resources, but it's still a bit disappointing that there only seem to be four types of creatures to encounter, each with a few different variations that make them more deadly but not any more interesting. </p><p>Playing Satisfactory alone can be a lot of fun, but once you add friends to the mix it goes from great to downright amazing. Not only does building with friends allow you to get more done quicker and bounce ideas off one another, but you can each take off to a different part of the map and still work towards shared goals by building infrastructure to transport goods and players from place-to-place. One especially cool aspect is that, once you unlock supernatural alien technology that defies the laws of physics (which happens surprisingly early rather than being wasted on the endgame alone), you can begin sharing resources with one another remotely by uploading your bounty to the Dimensional Depot, which anyone can pull items directly into their inventory from at any time. This creates a really cool dynamic, where a player you haven’t seen in the world for several hours can pipe up to ask for help with something, and you can virtually hand them the resources they need to solve their problem.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Games That Are Way Too Complicated</h3><p>Sometimes it just feels good to sweat all over your keyboard with beautifully convoluted mechanics. These are the best games to play if that mood strikes you.</p></div><p>If there’s one real issue with Satisfactory, it’s that sometimes its ambition exceeds its grasp, leading to a pretty steady stream of performance issues and bugs (at least on the pre-release 1.0 build I had access to for this review). Crashes were a regular occurrence for my crew, especially for those joining my world for multiplayer, and as your factory grows to an absurd size and complexity, you’ll start to see pop-in, weird textures, and framerate dips with increasing frequency. I played on three separate PCs of varying levels of power, and though each could run Satisfactory fine at the outset, by the end only my Ryzen 9 7950X3D/<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition-review">RTX 4090</a> could run it without at least moderate issues. You’ll likely need a fairly powerful rig to run this one with consistency, but even when it struggled a bit on two of my PCs, those problems were only ever an annoyance rather than anything so severe that they made me want to stop playing.</p><p>I’ve played over 90 hours of Satisfactory's 1.0 release, and I already have a pretty good idea of where I stand with it at this point, but I’ve still got a final round of uber-challenging endgame tasks to complete before I’ve seen it all and can confidently deliver my verdict. For now, I can tell you that there’s a whole heckuva lot to enjoy. Now, if you don’t mind, I really should get back to it – these production pipelines aren’t going to optimize themselves!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/satisfactory-temp-score-1725937010222.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Title update 1.1.2 weighs in at 1.92GB on PlayStation 5, 2.25GB on Xbox Series X and S, and 1.89GB on PC.</p><p>The patch notes, published to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft’s website</a>, begins by thanking fans “for the amazing positivity and support following the launch of Star Wars Outlaws! Your passion, love for Kay, Nix, our open world and all your amazing creations through our Photo mode has been a real inspiration for the whole team.”</p><p>The patch focuses on early feedback to address various issues and PC performance, as well as overall stability, Ubisoft said. Additionally, cross progression and saves through Ubisoft Connect are now available.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But the highlight is an improvement to what Ubisoft called “some challenging stealth moments.” With this patch, it is now less likely to be detected while rolling, and the level of detection is adjusted depending on location.</p><p>Creative director Julian Gerighty had admitted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-unfair-instant-fail-stealth-missions-a-mistake-dev-admits-patch-due-next-week">Outlaws’ instant fail stealth missions were "incredibly punishing" and signaled they’d be fixed soon</a>. "For me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving," he said.</p><p>"I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p><p>"I think it feels unfair. And believe it or not, this wasn't our intention. This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so, and that we're correcting already for a patch that's coming out maybe in 10 days."</p><p>That patch, out now, also means the Old School Cool trophy can now be unlocked for PS5 players, so they can finally platinum the game.</p><p>“As we continue to work on future updates for Star Wars Outlaws, we will keep on carefully listening to your feedback and experience in the game,” Ubisoft said. “Thank you for your support and see you in the outer rim!”</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws’ commercial performance is the subject of much debate.

And this week, a minority investor in Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">called on the company to go private</a> as its share price fell further. Ubisoft has yet to comment.</p><p>IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Star Wars Outlaws is a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." </p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws - Title Update 1.1.2 patch notes:</h2><p><strong>New Feature</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cross-progression and saving is now available between all platforms through Ubisoft Connect.

It comes with a 2TB SSD, but all of the games you install will be downloaded from the PlayStation Store, because the PS5 does not have a disc drive.

The company's next major release will come on November 15 with Assassin's Creed Shadows, a highly anticipated entry in the series that fans have wanted for years. Ubisoft has remained stubbornly independent (and public) as many other gaming companies of its size have been purchased by even larger players in the industry, most notably Activision. Tencent did buy a minority stake in the company in 2022, but it has no board seats.</p>

            <p>
If you've been feeling a little trucked out with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>'s existing 15 states, and have been dreaming of more beatiful tarmac to traverse soon, there's good news: developer SCS Software has announced its Arkansas expansion will arrive next Monday, 16th September. And ahead of that, there's a major new patch adding improved controller support and more.
</p>
<p>
"Located in the south-central region of the United States," explains SCS in its blurb for American Truck Simulator's Arkansas expansion, "the state is a nature wonderland with three national forests, many State Parks, nearly 9,000 miles of pristine streams and rivers like the Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as the ever-stretching Ozark and Ouachita mountain ranges."
</p>
<p>
As such, truckers hitting the road through SCS' version of Arkansas can expect ample natural beauty, alongside "large and small towns and cities, where you'll find industries, landmarks and more." All of which will bring American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 16, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

<p>
As to what's next, SCS Software has already confirmed Iowa and Missouri are in development, meaning it'll need to turn its attention to North and South Dakota, Minnesota, and Louisiana at some point, if it wants to plug up some gaps.
</p>
<p>
But ahead of all that, and indeed Arkansas' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585150/American_Truck_Simulator__Arkansas/">arrival on Steam</a> next week, SCS has released a major new American Truck Simulator patch - officially known as update 1.51 - introducing a whole bunch of new features. There is, for instance, a brand-new title screen to match SCS' recent interface overhaul, as well as new realistic shadows for truck interiors. Additionally, the Nebraska DLC's dynamic loading and unloading feature for grain hopper trailers has now been expanded to Kansas, Arkansas, and other "prefab" depots across the game.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside new controller configuration settings intended to offer "more flexibility and control". SCS says players should now be able to control more game features using a controller - in a way that "resembles driving a vehicle in real life" - which will apparently "pave the way for exciting future projects". Console ports, perhaps? Time will tell!

<p>
Additionally, once 1.51 is installed, owners of American Truck Simulator's Oklahoma expansion can travel the entirety of Interstate 44, with SCS' latest update finally connecting its east and west portions by adding the previously missing midsection through Oklahoma City. In other expansion refresh news, Oregon now has its own cinematic custom city intros, and if you've got the Texas expansion, you may noticed some vegetation tweaks, with the eastern side of the state now home to loblolly pines, creating a smoother transition into Arkansas.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-%E2%80%93-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5.977061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After months and months of rumours and speculation, Sony has finally taken the wraps off the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, a mid-generation spec bump that aims to banish the choice between Fidelity mode and Performance modes. Here’s what we now know about the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Console - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HaRMiTfvks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>PS5 Pro release date, price &amp; pre-orders</h2>
<p>One of the main things to know about the PS5 Pro is when it’s coming out and how much it will cost. The launch date for the PS5 Pro is set for 7th November 2024. Pre-orders will go live on 26th September 2024.</p>


<p>As for the cost, I hope you’ve been saving up, because it will set you back $700 / £700 /€800 / ¥120,000.</p>
<p>Note that this is a disc-less console at that price, with support for the optional UHD drive add-on debuted alongside the PS5 Slim. It’s also a horizontal console unless you fork out for a vertical stand.</p>

<h3>A partial PS5 Pro spec sheet</h3>
<p>Mark Cerny did not provide a full spec sheet, but this is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/ps5-reveal-list-games-playstation-5-date-specs-everything/">an extension of the base PS5</a>. In other words, it will still have the same 8 core Zen 2 CPU (potentially clocked a little bit higher), 16GB of RAM, us the Tempest 3D AudioTech engine, allow you to slot in an extra NVMe drive, and more. The console is roughly the same height as the original PS5, with the width of the PS5 Slim.</p>

<p>Here’s where it’s improved and upgraded:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>GPU</strong></td>
<td>60 Compute Units – 67% increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>AI Upscaling</strong></td>
<td>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Memory</strong></td>
<td>16 GB GDDR6 at 573GB/s – 28% increase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Internal Storage</strong></td>
<td>2TB built-in NVMe SSD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Optical Drive</strong></td>
<td>Optional Ultra HD Blu-ray (sold separately)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Video Output</strong></td>
<td>Up to 4K at 120Hz, 8K, VRR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td data-align="left"><strong>Wireless Network</strong></td>
<td>Wi-Fi 7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The 67% increase in GPU compute units, fed by a 28% increase in RAM speed allows for roughly 45% increase in GPU performance. However, there’s much more to it than that.</p>
<p>The enhanced GPU also comes alongside improved ray-tracing that can offer 2-3x the performance of the base PS5. It’s not clear if this is entirely down to the GPU, or if it’s going hand-in-hand with the PSSR processor. Still, that’s quite an impressive bump.</p>
<p>But what does this all mean for your gaming?</p>
<h3>Graphical improvements with PS5 Pro</h3>
<p>Developers will be able to use all of this power in a number of ways. Mark Cerny stated that Sony’s goal was to effectively remove the need for graphics modes, so numerous games will be upgraded to provide Fidelity Mode graphics at Performance Mode frame rates – examples included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5/">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a>.</p>
<p>Already performant games can alternatively push enhanced visual effects into the games. Gran Turismo 7, for example, will now be able to render ray-traced reflections during races, when these were previously limited to replays. This will likely be the new Fidelity vs. Performance mode toggle.</p>
<h2>PS5 Pro game upgrades</h2>
<p>The games already confirmed to have native PS5 Pro enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon’s Souls</li>
<li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps5-ps4/">Horizon Forbidden West</a></li>
<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, enhanced games will be marked with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label.</p>
<h3>PS5 Pro backward compatibility enhancements</h3>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancements are not limited to games with native support and updates. The console is fully compatible to the library of PS5 and backward compatible PS4 games available on standard PS5, and you can leverage it in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PS5 Pro Game Boost</strong> – this can be applied across all PS4 and PS5 games, using the GPU power to stabilise or improve performance of games, similar to the PS4 Pro Game Boost feature back in the day. With many games featuring dynamic resolution and now variable refresh rate modes, this will be a great de facto upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Image Quality </strong>– Available for “select PS4 games”, the PS5 Pro will seemingly be able to use PSSR to upscale the PS4 image to higher resolutions. This will be most useful for early generation PS4 games, which were not enhanced for PS4 Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly there doesn’t seem to be an effort to do Xbox-style game injection, which would have potentially been able to replace FSR and FSR 2 upscaling with PSSR, but it’s possible that this could be added in a firmware update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-the-dark-horizon-is-the-third-and-final-dlc-out-on-september-24/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Gunfire Games and Arc Games announced the release date for Remnant II: The Dark Horizon, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-gets-third-dlc-delay-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final DLC</a> scheduled for Remnant II: September 24.</p>
<p>In The Dark Horizon, players will return to N'Erud and discover a mysterious place preserved in time, where alien farmlands are tended by robots for long-dead inhabitants. But time corrupts everything, and rogue AI and robotic creations are now threats to travelers searching for the secrets of a colossal being that dominates the skyline. Players will uncover the secrets within the necropolis world of N'Erud. Moreover, as they enter this new overworld, they'll find new dungeons, experience a new glider traversal system not found elsewhere, acquire a new archetype, The Warden, meet unexpected allies, and face new threats.</p>
<p>The glider traversal system lets players choose which parts of the overworld they want to explore, including how to face the new world boss. As for The Warden, the new archetype uses a fully automated Drone that can shield, heal, or even attack enemies, making it the perfect partner on the battlefield. Remnant II: The Dark Horizon will also add many items and powerful weapons, including new items such as amulets and rings. When it comes to boss fights, fans can expect mysterious threats and survivors of unknown origin to emerge from the long-extinct civilization, with rogue AI and robotic creations lurking around every corner, posing new challenges for all players.</p>

<p>Beyond the Dark Horizon, Remnant II will also get a free update on the same day. The highlight of the patch is undoubtedly the new Boss Rush game mode. As suggested by the name, Boss Rush lets players get right into the action with bosses. The mode is playable either solo or with fellow travelers via multiplayer, and players may choose from three difficulty levels - Triple Threat (a three-boss run), Trial by Fire (a seven-boss run), and The Gauntlet (a nineteen-boss run).</p>
<p>The mode's goal is simple yet extremely challenging: successfully battle hordes of enemies, including an Aberration, to face bosses and earn drops. Along the way, players will earn temporary buffs during the run that grant stat bonuses and/or powerful passive bonuses that will prove helpful. To access Boss Russ, they can go to the World Stone in Station 13 and select the mode, similar to selecting Campaign or Adventure).</p>

<p>In addition to the new game mode, the free Remnant II content update will also introduce a new system called Prisms. Prisms are a new feature of the rebalanced fragment system and can be leveled up to grant additional stat bonuses.</p>

            <p>Grand duchess of first-person factory sims Satisfactory has finally hit 1.0 on PC after five years in early access, introducing a "full narrative overhaul" together with some new alien technology which you can witness and boggle at via the 1.0 launch trailer, below. They've also announced a console version, but we don't care for such things. The only Satisfactory console I care about is the one that lets you deactivate the fog so you can obtain an unmurky view of your glittering conveyor belt empire.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you're new to Satisfactory, it's about turning a perfectly blameless alien planet into a gleaming and grinding network of production lines. You're a "Pioneer" working on behalf of the illustrious FICSIT Inc, who need you to extract and process any resources worth noting and send it up the Space Elevator for the purposes of the Save The Day program. It's possible that FICSIT Inc aren't quite what they're cracked up to be, but hush now -  you're here to ensure a steady flow of matter into the refinery, not think about "worrying undertones". Or even "worrying overtones" - Satisfactory's satire of space capitalism isn't exactly subtle.</p>
<p>‌Back in 2020, Rock Paper Shotgun's own far-future Dickensian habitat despoiler Brendan Caldwell deemed Satisfactory a ruddy good time. And also, a relatively laidback one given a sufficient quantity of spare leisure hours. "Everything can be twiddled and tweaked to make an assembly line run with utmost efficiency, or even slowed down to half speed, to make output steadier and avoid clogged conveyor belts," he wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-review-early-access">Satisfactory early access review</a>. "But the opposite is also true. You can, like me, play the whole thing by ear. Make a shitty factory. It's fine. You're the only human on the planet, no one is going to fire you." It's just as well, Brendy, because that "needless, kilometre-long pipeline" sounds like it might have earned you a few weeks' suspension without pay. </p>
<p>Satisfactory has come a ways since Brendy stunk up the early access build with his excess plumbing. The 1.0 version adds various technologies, including endgame Portals "for near-instantaneous transportation across the vast alien lands", though this requires "huge power capacity" and access to Singularity Cells. Dimensional Depots, meanwhile, "offer an efficient option for inventory management" powered by Strange Alien Matter. I am guessing they let you store things in alternate dimensions. You also have more power to customise your uniform, with a range of colours, helmets, tool trinkets and skins. Nothing like a powerdrill pendant to keep your mind on the job and not on why you're reducing an Edenic paradise to a maze of smokestacks.</p>
<p>We have written many a thing about Satisfactory over the years - here's Alex Wiltshire (RPS in Minecraft) recounting how developers Coffee Stain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-satisfactorys-developer-tricked-their-audience-and-why-their-audience-loved-it">lied about pipes</a>, and here's Brendy again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cars-in-videogames">praising the golfcart</a>. Personally, I've only ever sunk a piffling 10 hours into the early access build. I engineered some kind of logjam involving smelters and couldn't be arsed to fix it. This is my cue to start afresh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony today announced the PlayStation 5 Pro, a mid-generation hardware upgrade that will play the same game library as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">2020's PlayStation 5</a>, but with higher frame rates and better resolution than on the original system. The new units will be available on November 7 for $700, Sony said.</p>
<p>The updated hardware will come complete with 2TB of solid-state storage (up from 1TB on the original PS5), but without an Ultra HD Blu-Ray disc drive, which users <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">can purchase as an add-on accessory for $80</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8">a video presentation Tuesday</a>, Sony's Mark Cerny said PS5 developers "desire more graphics performance" in order to deliver the visuals they want at a frame rate of 60 fps. The lack of enough graphical power on the PS5 leads to a difficult decision for players between the higher resolution of "fidelity" mode and the smoother frame rates of "performance" mode (with three-quarters of players choosing the latter, according to Cerny).</p>
<p>The goal of the PS5 Pro, Cerny says, is delivering "the graphics that the game creators aspire to, at the high frame rates players typically prefer." To do this, the new system will sport a larger GPU that can support "up to 45 percent faster rendering," Cerny said, with 67 percent more compute units and 28 percent faster video RAM than the PS5. This will allow for "almost fidelity-like graphics at 'performance' frame rates" of 60 frames per second in many existing PS5 games, Cerny said.</p>

                    The two sides of this comparison are supposed to look comparable in fidelity, but the PS5 Pro is running at 60 fps, as opposed to 30 fps on the PS5.                  </p>

<p>The PS5 Pro will also bring what Cerny says is a "streamlined and accelerated approach" to ray-tracing, with individual rays calculated at "double or even triple the speeds of PlayStation 5." In examples shown on video, Cerny highlighted how reflections between cars are now available at 60 fps for <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> on the PS5 Pro, and how games like <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> could have more realistic shadow effects.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>An "AI library" called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) will be available on the PS5 Pro to automatically upscale in-game scenes as well. Cerny highlighted how this can make distant crowds in a game like <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to look much clearer.</p>
<p>Titles that can take advantage of the PS5 Pro's more powerful GPU will be marketed as "PS5 Pro Enhanced." Titles that will sport that designation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alan Wake 2</em></li>
<li><em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em></li>
<li><em>Demon’s Souls</em></li>
<li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></li>
<li><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em></li>
<li><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></li>
<li><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></li>
<li><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></li>
<li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></li>
<li><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></li>
<li><em>The Crew Motorfest</em></li>
<li><em>The First Descendant</em></li>
<li><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Other titles will be able to take advantage of "PS5 Pro Game Boost," which Sony says "may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games."</p>
<h2>PS5.5</h2>
<p>The upgrade follows the history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">the PS4 Pro</a>, which launched almost exactly three years after the PS4 and offered the capacity for higher resolutions, faster frame rates, or both in many PS4 library games. The PS5 Pro comes further into the lifecycle for Sony's latest console, though, and at a point where Sony has yet to lower <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/is-the-us-market-ready-to-embrace-a-500-game-console/">the $500 launch price</a> for the console and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">increased the price of the disc-drive-free Digital Edition</a> last year (though inflation has taken some of the sting out of that nominal pricing).</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro comes after last year's launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/ps5-slim-teardowns-suggest-same-chip-not-much-shrinking-but-nifty-disc-drive/">a redesigned PS5 "Slim" model</a>, which reduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-playstation-5-looks-to-be-the-biggest-game-console-ever-made/">the original PS5's famously massive bulk</a> while keeping the internal processing power the same while</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Michael Myers was previously introduced into Call of Duty: Ghosts as a playable character who was a reward for completing a challenge on the Fog DLC map. This time the horror icon looks to be returning as an operator bundle. Other Halloween-themed operators are teased for this year's The Haunting, including the scarecrow from Trick 'R Treat and the clown from the Terrifier movies. The trailer also showcases a demonic, three-headed operator skin for Ghost, and Makarov has a terrifying grin that looks very much related to the Smile movie.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on Season 6 should be revealed in the coming days. The new season of Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone should bring the usual offerings of a brand-new battle pass, more seasonal challenges, and game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, Activision has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-activision-confirms/1100-6526378/">Black Ops 6 will not have a campaign early-access period</a>.
