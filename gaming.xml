		<p>All-consuming audiovisual VR odyssey <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thrasher">Thrasher</a> is getting a flatscreen release later this year, alongside the PC VR port of the game. There’s no release date just yet, but this port will let you play this successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thumper">Thumper</a> across PC headsets, gaming PCs and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRASHER 2D Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kc-UKVdHG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally releasing last year for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro, the game skipped out on PC or consoles to start with. We can only hope that there are plans for a PS5 and PSVR 2 release in this game’s future as well.</p>
<p>Coming from Brian Gibon, the artist and composer of Thumper, and Mike Mandel or Rock Band VR at their new studio Puddle, Thrasher looks to explore the rhythm action genre in a similarly dark and moody style. In this game you guide a space eel that is swooping through alien worlds in a race for survival, with players digging into a combo system that ties in with a chase to the top of leaderboards.</p>
<p>This was designed with VR in mind, fully immersing you into the game’s world, but it’s now being reworked to keep as much of that atmosphere when playing on a traditional flat screen platform. The visuals are being enhanced to take advantage of the power of modern gaming PCs when compared to standalone VR headsets. You’ll probably want to have a great pair of headphones plugged in, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/18/thumper-psvr2-review/">Returning to the 2016 classic Thumper in 2023</a>, Dom said, “Thumper remains a true VR classic, and its upgrade for PSVR2 makes it the best place to experience its violent audio charms.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 patent that was updated a few days ago provides additional details on AI-powered upscaling, strongly indicating that the system will indeed support the technology in some capacity.</p>
<p>As spotted by Mike Odyssey, the patent was updated last week on March 13th with some additional details on how AI-upscaling works, taking a 520p resolution image and upscaling it to a 1080p resolution output using a neural network. The 520p and 1080p resolutions mentioned in the patent may also indicate how the tech will be used in handheld mode, confirming the console's screen resolution, but there's nothing in the updated patent that suggests a specific use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo just released an update for Nintendo Switch 2 on AI resolution Upscaling. It's happening, folks! <a href="https://t.co/6GZUEXeBli">pic.twitter.com/6GZUEXeBli</a></p>
<p>— Mike Odyssey - Nintendo Switch 2 Experience Dallas (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1901107300581937596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Considering how the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by NVIDIA technology, how DLSS itself was mentioned in a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/"> previous patent,</a> and how Nintendo has already used AMD FSR in some of its original Switch games, there's little doubt that the console will support AI-upscaling in some form, although we will probably only get confirmation during the April 2nd Nintendo Direct. According to Kiwi Talks host Reece Reilly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-720p-resolution/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will be the star of the show, as its true, proper unveiling will blow everything else in the Direct out of the water.</p>

<p lang="en">In less than a month in the Switch 2 direct you'll see that Nintendo &amp; Retro were keeping their cards close to their chest with Metroid Prime 4 for this exact moment. The true unveiling will blow everything else in the direct out of the water.</p>

<p>The April 2nd Direct will likely confirm the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, which, according to analysts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">former Nintendo employees</a>, will be in early summer. The fact that<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/"> around 400,000 units were reportedly shipped to North America in January</a> suggests that the console's release is indeed not too far off.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, and in this article,&nbsp;<span>we'll have a detailed look at what's inside it and see what&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> is all about</span>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=VCR0jFXm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=v1xFUkmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p>Games of <em>Warmachine</em> begin with each player's selection of a Warcaster, a powerful mage that sets the tone for the rest of your army. While each faction has a distinct feel, the Warcaster you choose, each with a unique once-per-battle ability, can change how the force functions. Backing up the Warcaster are Warjacks, powerful metal constructs that pack a punch on the battlefield.&nbsp;Further supporting your Warcaster and Warjacks are Solos, individual warriors, and Units, groups of warriors, who flesh out the rest of your force</p>

<p>All of the rules and unit stats are available for free on the <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/pages/warmachine-app" rel="nofollow"><em>Warmachine</em> app</a>, so I won't go into too much detail here, but there are 2 standout mechanics for me. The first is the focus mechanic, a currency that Warcasters generate each turn. Warjacks also generate a small amount of focus, but the onus is on the Warcaster to transfer over some of their focus to the Warjack, or keep it to power their own magic and special abilities, or to boost or gain additional attacks. This adds a lot of flexibility in your turn and opens up options for how you use your Warcaster and Warjacks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-8.jpg?itok=Iw_fOlOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-8.jpg?itok=_R0xt6eS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In <em>Warmachine</em>, when a Warjack is damaged, a dice is rolled to see which column takes the damage.</figcaption></figure><p>The second standout mechanic for me is the Warjack damage system. Rather than a simple damage stat that you subtract from as Warjacks take damage, instead there's a damage table that is rolled against. The number rolled indicates the column that takes damage, and once that column fills up, further damage is allocated to the next column. Letters are also spread across the bottom of each damage column, and once all of one type of letter has been damaged, it affects the efficiency of the Warjack. For example, once all the M letters (for Movement) have taken damage, the Warjack is automatically hit by melee attacks and has its defense reduced. This damage system on the Warjacks works very well as they can soak a lot of initial damage, but then systems will start to shut down as you damage them further. It gives a really thematic feel to the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warmachine</em> rules are scenario-focused, which means that you're going to be focusing a lot of getting things done and stopping your opponent from doing them, but always looming over you is that if your Warcaster is taken out, you lose immediately. And no matter what you're doing during the game, you need to be aware of how exposed your Warcaster is, whilst slyly checking if your opponent has left theirs vulnerable. In the games I've played so far, this usually led to some insane assassination attempts that were epic if they paid off and almost always cost you the game if they didn't,&nbsp; but they were always fun and cinematic.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_1.jpg?itok=SpKZBnEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_1.jpg?itok=Qi0057vO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A New Starter</h2>

<p>Part of Steamforged Games' plan with taking over <em>Warmachine</em>, was the release of a new 2-player starter set. This new set sees the Cygnar Storm Legion clashing against the Khador Winter Korps, and we'll go into more detail of each force below. The main thing to note with this set is that it only contains the miniatures for the 2 forces and some terrain pieces; all the rules and unit cards are on the <em>Warmachine</em> app. If you want to use this set straight away, you'll also have to have some 6-sided dice, a measuring tool and some tokens. The box does make this clear, and this is similar to many other systems now, taking their rules almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>The lack of rules, accessories and stat cards in the box does make it feel less like a new player starter set, but an intro sheet in the pack points players towards the build instructions, a <em>Warmachine</em> Quick-Start guide (which is very good and takes you through everything, including the first few turns of the game) and the app itself. The app is well designed, clear, and works well, and this process does mean that new players are starting the game with the tools that they will continue to use in <em>Warmachine</em>, rather than having to make the jump to the app after their first few games.</p>

<p>The forces that are included are well-designed for a new starter set, giving both players one of each unit type (Warcaster, Warjack, Solo, and Unit). They are also both exactly 30-point forces, the smallest game of <em>Warmachine</em> you can play, and there's no variation in armaments in the builds, which means that new players can safely construct without having to worry about optimal builds before they learn the rules.</p>

<p>The included units are also Cadre units, which means that they can be used across all forces in the faction. We'll talk in detail about this when we cover the Gravediggers in an upcoming article, but all you need to know here are that the Gravediggers are a sub-faction of the Cygnar force and can also use all the&nbsp;Cygnar units in this box. This is great, as it means that as long as players choose one of the factions in the box to continue with, they'll always be able to use those units.</p>

<p>I really like the fact that the starter set is just miniatures, and isn't locking starter set components into a specific box. If players don't like the look of either of these factions, they can just pick up a different Command Starter Set and access the rules the same way. I think the inclusion of some dice, tokens, and a measuring tool would have made it a truly new player starter set, and even the other starter sets could include some thematic accessories that veteran players would love too. The digital rules mean that players are going straight into the current version, with printed rules being out of date after a rules update and the balance and player experience can be controlled by SFG, who can tweak the starter set units live.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_2.jpg?itok=Whw-9Biv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_2.jpg?itok=uy4JPl-i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Into The Storm</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;Cygnar Storm Legion troops in the <em>Warmachine</em> 2-Player Starter Set are a group known as the&nbsp;Hellslinger Cadre. The Hellsligners are led by the Warcaster,&nbsp;Major Allister Caine. Caine dual-wields Spellstorm pistols, which have 3 attack types to choose from when shooting. He boosts nearby gun mages, giving them headshot, and has access to teleport to get him out of trouble once he's laid down some fire. Caine is backed up by his Warjack, Deuce, who's armed with a powerful Spellstorm Cannon and has truesight, which lets them fire through cloud effects (which is handy for targeting the opponents of this starter set).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-5_0.jpg?itok=fWXPKq_G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-5_0.jpg?itok=Tbd9vAqh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Hellslingers' solo is&nbsp;Captain Bastian Falk, a ranged expert who can deploy further ahead than the rest of the force. Falk can also immediately return fire with his&nbsp;Magelock Scattergun if he is missed by an enemy ranged attack. He also passes that ability on to nearby gun mages, so keeping all of your units together lets them overlap buffs. The Black 13th is a 3-model unit of just those gun mages. Each is armed with a magic ranged weapon, each with 3 unique fire options to deal with most situations. They can also forward deploy with Falk and gain the benefits of both Falk and Caine's buffs to gun mages.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, the Hellslinger Cadre likes to stand and shoot and I love the Wild West feel to the miniatures. I'm definitely going to make a hat for Deuce to match the rest of the Hellslingers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=SY5GNKK8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=bfZrCJdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Winter Is Coming</h2>

<p>The Khador Winter Korps troops in the <em>Warmachine</em> 2-Player Starter Set are known as the&nbsp;SKS-6 Cadre. And they are led by&nbsp;Kapitan Zahara Vilkul. Vilkul has a once-per-game feat that puts between 4 and 6 cloud templates on the battlefield to obscure the advance of her force (the Hellslingers Warjack, Deuce can unhelpfully still target through these clouds). More importantly, Vilkul has an incredible threat range using her Cyclone spell that lets her make a full move and attack, which can be used after a charge to let her attack an enemy up to 18 inches away. Vilkul is accompanied by her Warjack Razor, who comes armed with short-ranged weapons and excels in close combat where its ripper shield adds to Razor's durability and also gives it a powerful melee attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-7_0.jpg?itok=q9JkQiwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-7_0.jpg?itok=wXaP_JZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sergeant Goran Lazarenko, the Jackal, is the SKS-6 solo, and his miniature features a rocket leaving the launcher tube in an epicly animated sculpt. He gets to pick the column the damage goes into when a Warjack takes damage, so he can target specific columns with letters that will disrupt his target the most. The Hounds are the SKS-6 unit, and each of its 3 members comes armed with different ranged weapons to meet any situation. Where they have commonality is that they each carry a blast shield, which they can use in combat. They're already pretty durable, but their Sheild Wall ability means that whenever the models from this unit are in base-to-base contact with each other, they get an additional +2 armor on top of their already substantial armor.</p>

<p>The SKS-6 Cadre likes to get in much closer than the Hellslingers, which means running the gauntlet of ranged attacks to close the distance. Vilkul's smoke enables this, but Deuce being able to see through it is unhelpful. If Vilkul can activate within 18 inches of Caine, the Hellslingers Warcaster, then it's usually game over, but it can be tricky getting there if the Hellslingers want to play at range.</p>

<h2>Warmachine 2-Player Starter Set Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I love both factions in this set, and while it can feel a little one-sided for the Hellslingers (who can shoot from the start and force the SKS-6 to close with them), if the SKS-6 can get close enough, they can really hammer the Hellslingers. I would have liked to have seen some themed accessories in the box, or even just the option of a Starter Set accessories pack add-on, which will still keep the cost down of the box, avoid duplication to those who have dice and tape measures, but still make it super accessible for new players. The quick-start guide (which is very good) that's linked to from the box could even be printed and thrown in with that accessory set. The digital rules work and make sure anyone picking up the box is getting the most up-to-date rules and stats, allowing SFG to tailor the starter experience if they do find that one side (the Hellsligners) has a much easier time.</p>

<p>The forces are well-designed and give a good experience for what those 2 factions are all about, along with being 30-point armies with one of each unit type, and available to all forces within that faction. There can be a lot of rules for new players to grasp for the 2 included forces, especially with the area of effect and overlapping buffs, but the quick-start going through the first few turns does help. Overall, I'm pleased to get back into <em>Warmachine</em> with this box, which I haven't played since 2019. This starter set feels fresh, and the miniatures look fantastic.</p>

<p>Word of this upcoming Sony collaboration comes from <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf">a report published by People Can Fly</a> itself.

			<p>Resident Evil 9 is taking a long time to release because it will be a reinvention of the series, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, well-known Resident Evil series insider Dusk Golem talked about the ninth main entry in the survival horror series by CAPCOM, saying that fans will realize why the new game is taking this long to release when it is revealed, as it is a big reinvention of the series as much as the fourth and seventh entries in the series were back in the day that will be very ambitious and will try new things that will make it play anything like its direct predecessors or the remakes. Dusk Golem also seems certain it will be revealed this year, so hopefully, it will be part of the usual slew of summer reveals in a few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(2/2) is taking so long is because it's like a big reinvention of the series, to the same level as RE4 &amp; RE7. It's not going to play just like RE7/RE8 or the Remakes, it's trying new things &amp; very ambitious. It will almost definitely be revealed this year, so just hold tight.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499831455186984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very little is currently known about Resident Evil 9 other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/">Early rumors</a> suggested that Leon and Jill would play a big role in the game, but according to Dusk Golem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/">these rumors are not correct</a>. In development together with the next main entry in the series is also a Resident Evil Zero remake, which will be the next series remake to release.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game did not perform well for publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, it's been claimed.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which launched last autumn to a mixed response from fans, resulted in "large losses" for the company, <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535">Kabutan analyst Hideki Yasuda stated</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ffxvi-has-apparently-sold-3-5-million-copies-could-be-old-numbers-read-op.1133091/">ResetEra</a>/<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-sales-financial-report-large-loss-square-enix-sequel-unlikely/">TheGamer</a>).
</p>
<p>
Officially, Square Enix is yet to comment on Double Exposure's performance - and there's been no word on Double Exposure's sales figures pubicly at all. Deck Nine, the game's developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">previously announced layoffs at the studio in the wake of the game's launch</a>, and it's unclear what's next for the franchise - despite Double Exposure ending with a message stating that protagonist Max Caulfield would "return".

<p>
Last week, Square Enix issued its most <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3earnings.pdf">recent financial results</a> - which largely focus on the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake and the successful launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps tellingly, there's no notice of how Life is Strange: Double Exposure sold. Instead, Square Enix simply says that its HD gaming division's revenues had fallen due to the fact that unnamed "new titles generated lower sales"  than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince did over the same period during the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix doesn't state what the new titles that underperformed were, but does say that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset these losses, as it had performed better than initially expected.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Yasuda and Square Enix for more detail. The company is yet to release a transcript of the financial briefing that includes shareholder questions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1. 
</p>
<p>
The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan reddit</a>, including posts by several anonymous commenters who provided proof they worked at Deck Nine, and who made a number of claims regarding how Double Exposure's story had changed through development, shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself. In response, Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".
</p>
<p>
"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> is a six player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> extraction spooper that currently sits atop Steam's best seller charts, having amassed around 70k players the week following early access launch on Feb 26, and another 160k since then. That's around 230 thousand players avoiding knifey chef frogs and persistent ducklings while extracting valuables to fill a cash quota. It's a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> but even heavier on the absurdity.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this popularity comes down to two things. Firstly, the game is a verdant flub factory, stuffed with the sort of chaotic physics mishaps that translate very well to short video clips. Even the loot extraction point can kill you if lingered in too long. Secondly, the 'Jim Henson does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata' robots you play as flap their mouths in time to your mic chatter, making even the most bowel-curdling fear shrieks from your teammates look like a hammy comedy routine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'd usually emit a croaking complaint about being too old for anything viral - the acrid dust cloud from my throat lingering in the air momentarily before cascading downwards and coating me in a grimy sheen of irrelevancy - but R.E.P.O. actually looks great. As it stands, though, you need five willing friends to play: a truly biblical quantity of mates, in the sense that it'd be faster to carve co-op partners from my own ribs than hash out that sort of byzantine scheduling.</p>
<p>Good news re: my organs staying shielded - developer Semiwork are planning on introducing public or private matchmaking. This'll come with a kick button to keep players honest, although they do say it's not quite that simple, since server coding is new ground for them. Here's the update video.</p>

<p>Joining ironmates mode is a new museum level, which they show off by demonstrating some award-winning box parkour. There's also some quality of life bits, like a border at extraction points to show when loot is out of bounds so you don't accidentally let it get crushed. Semiwork also show off a squinty, angry facial expression. Finally, there's a bucket you can pop over the duckling monster that likes to imprint motherhood on one of your crew then follow you around getting in your way and biting anyone that tries to touch it.</p>
<p>My current idea o' the day is Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the 'chronotope' - time and space configurations as a kind of contextual bubble -  as mentioned by valued RPS community member #9976 in the comments to Sunday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-80-days-heavens-vault-and-a-highland-songs-jon-ingold?view=comme">Booked For The Week</a>. A fifteen minute internet rabbit hole with coffee this morning led me to <a href="https://youtu.be/r4yluKPhTKE">this video</a> by the eminently listenable Belgian sociolinguist Jan Blommaert, who gives the example of a lecture: the space is the hall, the time is the lecture slot, and this particular chronotope encourages or necessities certain identities, roles, or modes of behaviour within in. An insightful framing of the twin navigations of interpersonal relationships and horror-harried spaces in social extraction games? You, uh, you might be starting to see why I'm enthusiastic about R.E.P.O.'s no-mates mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon actor Ashly Burch has addressed the AI Aloy video that leaked online last week, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a> reported on the emergence of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-internal-sony-video-uses-horizons-aloy-to-show-ai-powered-playstation-character-prototype">an internal Sony video showing off tech that uses Aloy from the Horizon series to demonstrate AI-powered characters</a>. Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">the upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3</a>. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734" data-video-id="7481742753991314734"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ashly.burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashly.burch</a> <p data-cy="paragraph">let us speak on AI aloy</p> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7481742843657194286?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ashly Burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Ashly Burch</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen"><u>Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</u></a> as part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-over-alleged-flagrant-violation-of-labor-law"><u>allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response</u></a>. And Activision confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast</u></a> after players expressed concern about new voices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-voice-actors-say-they-found-out-they-were-replaced-when-the-patch-notes-went-live"><u>two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealed</u></a> they learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-compared-to-elden-ring-for-its-player-freedom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet may be very different from what we're used to in Naughty Dog games. The studio's trademark has usually been cinematic, narrative-driven games, at least since Uncharted and, of course, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>However, MinnMax's Ben Hanson teased that he had heard from his sources that the studio's next project was being compared to something else. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdtygZnYqI&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2024 podcast</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>I heard from somebody very in the know who worked on the game that they're like Jesus Christ... the tone was like you are all not ready for how amazing this is going to be... and the tone was (I'm not going to say the game that they referenced to compare it)... but they compared to a game with a lot of player freedom.</em></p>
<p>Back then, the game hadn't been unveiled yet. That happened a couple of months later at The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a gorgeous debut trailer</a>. Now that the dust has settled, in the latest episode of The MinnMax Show, Ben Hanson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rcMrvLXPNY&amp;t=7232s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> exactly which game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was being likened to:</p>
<p><em>I think it's fine to say it now: that game was Elden Ring that it was compared to back then. If I would have said 'Naughty Dog's next game is like Elden Ring' and then that reveal trailer came out, I feel like we would have been lit on fire. But now that idea of, okay, it's taking place on one planet, kind of uncovering the history of this world, you can kind of see a little more where they might be going with that.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Neil Druckmann has since provided a bit more context. Before the reveal, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the new game was fresh to the studio, and he was curious about the players' reactions. This certainly fits such a big change in the degree of player freedom compared to Naughty Dog's most recent games.</p>
<p>Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as recently as last week that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would be a lonely game for players, unlike Uncharted and The Last of Us, where the main characters were almost always accompanied by allies. This is another hint that MinnMax's report is correct.</p>
<p>Of course, many questions remain. Is this a full-fledged action RPG, then? Can players explore the world of Sempiria in whichever order they see fit? Naughty Dog will undoubtedly respond in due time, although the game creator himself has also warned the project is still some ways off, so we might have to wait a while before learning all those details.</p>

            <p>I very much recommend the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a>, so it's with no shade I say that I'm using 'strategy' here the same way a tube passenger might use a hardback of Ulysses to envelop their novelisation of 2 Fast 2 Furious. Griddy placement and tower defence tactics are involved, but this is primarily a game about launching rocks at dickheads. This is fine by me: launching rocks at dickheads is as solid a premise as any videogame needs to have.</p>

<p>You'll start off with a 9 square grid surrounding a castle, then fill out those plots each turn by picking one of three cards. Some are buildings, like a cemetery that summons imps to fight in place of your slain units. Some are troops who'll rush to the centre of the battlefield at the beginning of each round. Your troops fight automatically, but you do have an important job here. I'm not sure if I mentioned it already: it's dropping rocks on heads. When you drop a rock really good, your dying foes squeak in falsetto anguish like a Lemming opening a devastating phone bill.</p>
<p>I'm being a touch facetious when I say it's all about rocks and heads. The demo is naturally a stripped-back sample, and even within it, I did start to notice some emerging combos. I gifted a square to some mercenary units early. They grew in number the more gold I had, which meant I could skip turns guilt-free by throwing cards down a well later, since each time I got bonus gold and so more bodies. There's also plenty of choice in how you expand your original plot, with positional buffs for certain buildings</p>
<p>Steam sez:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Build up your city into the most powerful of all kingdoms. Through endless combinations of buildings, troops, spells and positioning, find ways to break the game and become overpowered. Grow your kingdom in strategic ways, prepare for dozens of unique events, and show the world your kingdom can last longer than any other."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the full game contains lore, I would like to know where the rocks come from. They evidently come from your castle but there's no catapult or anything, just a void containing infinite rocks and the means to launch them. Gargantuan slingshot? Monkey with strong tail? Hellstorm rock battery? Answers, please, when the full game launches this April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, a fan-made standalone remake of Counter-Strike called CS: Legacy was unveiled with an announcement trailer. It's being made by a small group of developers who previously worked on CSPromod between 2008 and 2012 and have since got back together for this new project.</p>
<p>According to them, CS: Legacy will be a completely standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up with entirely custom code and game assets (textures, models, sounds, animations, UI, et cetera). The game is built on Valve's official 2013 Source Engine SDK codebase, with the developers making their own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various systems. It runs on its own advanced custom branch of Valve's official Source Engine 2013 public SDK. The aforementioned tweaks include a custom renderer, Physically Based Rendering shaders, a wholly rewritten reflection system, a fully custom UI, custom in-house source engine tools, and many more features.</p>
<p>The early access will include five maps: Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, Aim_map. Fans can support CS: Legacy by subscribing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CSLegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the team's Patreon</a>, which includes six tiers:</p>
