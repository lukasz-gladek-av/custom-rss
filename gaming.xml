<p>Much to like</p>

<p>Last week, Square Enix had us all scrambling to wrap up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Remake</a> as quickly as we could, as it announced that it'll be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to Switch 2 in just a few months on <strong>3rd June</strong>.</p>
<p>We only caught a brief glimpse at how the ambitious follow-up will fare on Nintendo hardware in the Partner Direct, but it was more than enough footage for the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-m5p3MnEmU">Digital Foundry</a> to take a look and suss out what we can expect from a performance perspective.</p>
<p>The good news is that the team was overall rather impressed with what they saw. Cutscene comparison shots to the PS5 version reveal that the Switch 2 edition makes some clear cutbacks in terms of environmental clutter (set dressing, foliage, etc.), and the textures once again see a significant drop in the resolution department, but it's far from a deal breaker. Besides, without the comparison shots, you're unlikely to spot many of the missing details on an initial Switch 2 playthrough.</p>
<p>The trailer seems to be counting in at 720p internally — a drop from Remake, but this is a much more demanding game — and the team did notice some frame pacing issues on display before pointing out that Remake's early marketing had similar problems, which were resolved by the time we got to launch.</p>
<p>Overall, the outlook is pretty optimistic. A downgrade from the PS5 version, of course, but the team suggests that things seem to be falling roughly in line with the Steam Deck, which is no bad thing.</p>
<p>We're sure that we'll be seeing a lot more from Rebirth as we get ever closer to June, so don't assume that this is it on the performance analysis front.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time with Remake earlier this year. "The Switch 2 version makes impressively few compromises to get this gorgeous-looking game running on the system," we said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our review</a>, "even at 30fps, this looks and feels fantastic". Here's hoping that Rebirth can keep the good times coming.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/echo-generation-2s-demo-teases-us-with-conspiracy-story-and-engaging-deckbuilding</link>
            <guid>1432315</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/echo-generation-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ae52c58-bf27-4725-a955-cfd07a88e454" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Echo Generation</em></a> was a game that immediately captured me when I first played its demo in 2020, and I was even more excited to see that a sequel was on the way. <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is an RPG where kids go on an adventure, discover the supernatural, and have a fun time along the way. I got my hands on the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo that shows a shift from traditional RPG combat to deckbuilding, and a story that hits the ground running with intrigue and larger stakes than before.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo, you start as 'Sister M', a girl raised in a secret facility, having her psychic powers tested by scientists. While she's normally ok to go with the flow, the disappearance of her friends that she was raised with causes her to want to confront the director of the program.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo was only a few hours long, so not too much of the story was explored. You could travel around the various locations in the facility, interact with a lot of the world and other scientists to learn what life has been like, and it ended with a tease of something much larger going on behind the scenes that has been interesting to dive into when the full game releases.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-exploration.jpg?itok=4RLsG0Mj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-exploration.jpg?itok=dQs1Liep 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It already feels like the adventure and the stakes of the journey will be far larger. While I'm excited to be able to set out on a new big adventure, I do think I'll miss the small town 'kids on bikes' vibes of the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">World exploration is quite standard, with plenty of humans and objects to interact with. The player is rewarded by fully exploring areas, allowing them to find various items and prompts for side-quests with beneficial rewards. The biggest change to the <em>Echo Generation</em> formula is in the combat.</p><h2>Build Decks And Unleash Combos In <em>Echo Generation 2</em></h2><p dir="ltr">Combat in <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is a turn-based deckbuilding experience. As Sister M, you can build up a deck of ten cards with different damage and healing effects, target parameters, status, and more. One card might deal 30 damage to every enemy and inflict a burn status and be usable three times in a single combat, while another can allow you to heal slightly better and get a regen effect for two turns and can be used twice per combat.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=k38ADqzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=gYG2OPcR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It's clear very early on that inflicting status effects is going to be extremely important as you progress through the game. Sister M's base ability lets her inflict two random statuses, and from fighting soldiers around the facility, you get a large number of cards that will inflict Burn, and then cards that will consume Burn for additional damage.</p><p dir="ltr">From the upgrade tree action economy will also play a major role as leveling up lets you play more cards through a turn, you'll go through your deck faster but have more chances to deal fast and powerful combos against your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The boss of the demo was one that I took a few tries to beat just to make sure I was able to find the right speed of dealing damage, building up combos, and also routinely setting up shields or healing myself. Thankfully, with any defeat, the game will put you right back to before you initiated that combat, so you can go right back into the fight or spend some time reworking your cards.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-deck.jpg?itok=SV65VklI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-deck.jpg?itok=3ouHm6U- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">At this level, I was already having fun toying with combos, so as more cards and more playable characters are added to the party, I'm excited for the future.</p><p dir="ltr">One aspect of the battles that does seem a bit underbaked is the reactions to enemy attacks. When an enemy is attacking, an icon will briefly appear that you need to press the interact button with before it disappears. At the end of my turn, I could start mashing the A button and clear the icon just as quickly as it appeared, allowing myself to always successfully block. I wonder if there will be enemies that will have icons that you want to not interact with, but for now, it seems a bit trivial.</p><p dir="ltr">Cococucumber continues to craft some of the prettiest games out there, with their high-quality voxel designs creating blocky characters and worlds, but ones that are filled with personality and detail. I sat back and watched blocky electricity pulse out of a mech after defeating it in awe.</p><p dir="ltr">For the few moments where there are things that aren't brick-based, it also really conveys the idea of "this is something strange in this world."</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing it would be carrying on the legacy of <em>Echo Generation</em> I was already excited for this sequel, and after sinking a few hours into the game, it's just not releasing soon enough.</p><hr><p><em><strong>TechRaptor </strong>previewed Echo Generation 2 on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Code Violet</em>, the dino horror game that probably wanted to hoover up players still disappointed in the lack of a <em>Dino Crisis </em>remake or sequel, is getting a followup, and it's got a very good name, if nothing else.</p><p>As revealed by developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TeamKill Media on X</a>, the sequel, which is currently in development, will be called <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. It's hard to argue with sequel naming like that, although I'm sure TeamKill will be hoping this one garners a better reception.</p><p>For context, <em>Code Violet </em>is an action-horror game that sees protagonist Violet battling through swarms of hostile dinosaurs in a bid to uncover the secrets of Aion, a colony that "harnesses cutting-edge time-travel technology to abduct women from the past to be surrogates" in order to save humanity from extinction.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Code Violet </em>is getting itself a sequel somehow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Presumably, <em>Code Violet</em>'s sequel must be happening because the game sold enough copies to make a followup viable, although if it did, I'm not sure everyone who bought it is entirely happy with their purchase.</p><p>A quick glance at the game's <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metacritic page</a> shows that it's currently sitting at an aggregate score of 29/100, which Metacritic rather drily says indicates a "generally unfavorable" reception, with user reviews coming in even lower at 26.</p><p>A number of professional critics and users alike describe <em>Code Violet </em>as the "worst game" they've ever played, with some describing it as "unplayable" and others using even less kind language than that. It looks like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b4a9b19-13fb-46ea-8565-3704316c3d25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">vulgar PC mods were the least of the dev's worries</a> after all.</p><p><em>Code Violet </em>fares a little better on its official <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Store page</a>, where more than 4,000 reviewers scored it at a 2.88 out of 5 cumulatively, although you'll find similarly excoriating text reviews if you delve a little deeper.</p>
<p>In any case, we'll have to see whether TeamKill Media can improve things for <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. With a name like that, I have to admit I'm kind of rooting for the devs. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

While it's likely we'll see Housemarque's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/saros">Saros</a>, considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026">it launches in April</a>, there's one PlayStation 5-exclusive we probably won't hear more about. That game is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a> – when someone on <a href="https://x.com/LukasBoii/status/2021332508688908790?s=20">X</a> asked the official Insomniac Games account when the studio would release more information about the game, Insomniac responded with, "Spring 2026."&nbsp;</p><p>This is a bit surprising as tomorrow's State of Play is one of the longest in recent years, with promised updates about PlayStation's first-party output. With Marvel's Wolverine due out sometime this year, you'd think this State of Play would be a great spot to highlight the game once more. But, it sounds like Insomniac won't be ready to do so until this Spring (which, for reference, begins March 20 in the U.S., where the studio is based).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the meantime, get refreshed on how the game is shaping up in the latest Marvel's Wolverine gameplay trailer:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's still a chance Marvel's Wolverine could appear during tomorrow's State of Play, perhaps as a surprise, but temper your expectations.

            <p>Supermassive Games' Lashana Lynch-starring survival horror Directive 8020 has landed itself a new release date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs">After an earlier delay</a>, it is now due to arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam) on 12th May, the team has announced.</p>
<p>To accompany this news, Supermassive has also released a new trailer, which gives us all a look at Directive 8020's choice-based narrative, such as should you as the ship's medic Cooper save fellow crew member Engineer Cernan who is in peril, or abandon them to a grizzly end. "Every choice has a consequence," the developer warns, so choose wisely.</p>
<p>You see, previous decisions can reshape situations in Directive 8020. So, in the case of Cooper, they could now have a gun, and when they potentially come face to face with two identical versions of Engineer Cernan, the player has to decide which one is real. "One choice will prove fatal," Supermassive states.</p>
<p>As well as all this, the latest Directive 8020 trailer also gives us a look at on-planet gameplay. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>In a first for Supermassive's Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 will also include a new feature known Turning Points, which allows you to more easily rewind and revisit key moments in the story. This will be handy for those completionists among us. There will also be a Survivor Mode, which means "no safety nets" and every death is permanent.</p>
<p>Those interested can pre-order Directive 8020 via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008357">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/directive-8020/9pf9qdh98k8l">Xbox Series X/S</a> now. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2255370/Directive_8020/">Steam</a> pre-orders will be coming "soon", Supermassive has said. Pre-orders include access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Dark Pictures Outfit Pack</li>
<li>The Dark Pictures Collectables</li>
<li>Cinematic Filter Pack</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassives-dark-pictures-series-returns-in-2025-with-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020">Directive 8020 will be a continuation of the studio's Dark Pictures series</a>, which started with Man of Medan, followed by Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me. Lynch has taken the lead role of "ground-breaking astronaut" Young.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">saw the game in action at Gamescom 2024</a>, calling it a "notable upgrade to the Dark Pictures Anthology's formula".</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has been around long enough now to have a "subculture" of its own. For the most part, millions of players have swarmed into Embark Studios' hit extraction shooter because most raiders found topside are... surprisingly nice. So far, the developers have been fostering a welcoming community even if PvP is an option, and the new event is all about experimenting with PvE further.</p>
<p>On 9th February, Embark announced the 'Shared Watch' event with <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020905547927552273?s=20">a cute little trailer</a>, and the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">patch notes</a> released the following day confirmed a substantial update before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shares-early-2026-roadmap-escalation-content-updates">February's 'Shrouded Sky' content update</a> continues to escalate the Arc threat. Saint Valentine's nears, so let's be good to each other.</p>
<p>What is it exactly about, you might ask? "Players will earn merits from destroying, assisting and damaging ARC and earn rewards. No merits will be earned from PvP encounters." You know what to do if you want to maximize your grind and meta progression!</p>
<p>The official post describes the Shared Watch as "an annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy," so expect it to be a yearly tradition. For the most part, the solo queues have been quite peaceful since launch, with most raiders choosing to help fellow scavengers. Uncommon evildoers aside, that's been a fantastic way to enjoy Arc Raiders in a more relaxed, less sweaty manner. It's good to see Embark play around with the game's core premise in conversation with the community though.</p><p>Before those who favour PvP encounters start whining about the studio paying a bit too much attention to the calmer side of Speranza recently, let's remember late January gave high-level players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you">the opportunity to join even tougher versus-centric lobbies</a>, so this feels natural if you ask me. In spite of all its success, Arc Raiders is still in its infant months, and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-marathon-cosmetics-and-content-details-chinese-event">Bungie's Marathon soon coming in hot with a stronger focus on PvP</a>, it'll be interesting to see how Embark reacts to the community's movements.</p>
<p>As surprise extras, the 1.15.0 update also adds two new cosmetic sets and brings back the Cold Snap map condition, as we're still technically in wintertime. Of course, more tweaks and bug fixes are part of the package, and we'd be surprised if there are no more minor patches before this month's major Escalation update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Wild Sheep Studio and publisher PQube have shared a new trailer and release target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/adorable-adventures">Adorable Adventures</a> – a game that absolutely lives up to its name! You will play as Boris, the curious baby boar who’s looking to reunite with his lost family, when Adorable Adventures launches for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year – a Steam demo is available now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Adorable Adventures | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_8FODhjrQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>How adorable is that? Boris has got separated from his family in a forest fire, but can set off to try and track them down. Boris will have to learn how to use his sense of smell to navigate –&nbsp;picking up scents of flowers, mushrooms, honeycomb and more –&nbsp;and have to start peeling away the strongest smells to pick out more subtle notes and find his brothers and sisters. He will be accompanied by the voiceover of park ranger Maxime, whose storytelling will adapt to what you do. You can also find journal entries from maxime’s journal and give Boris some accessories.</p>
<p>But he’s still a baby boar, and easily distracted. The game will also have time trial races, photography challenges, a spot of park tidying to do, and a local mystery to solve.</p>

<p>Wild Sheep Studio has form in this tone of game. The studio was originally founded to work on WILD with Michel Ancel and Ubisoft Paris in 2013, but after that game’s cancellation shifted to smaller games. Adorable Adventures has seen them head out from the studio to explore the Cévennes National Park, which is close to their base in Southern France, and take 3D scans of local plant life and ambient field recordings to recreate the forest atmosphere.</p>

Today, the studio has launched the 'Remnant' update, its first major patch of the year, and it's expectedly packed with additions.</p>
<p>The headliner this time around is the 'Gravitino Coil', an all-new Gravity Gun that lets you pick up debris and other large objects with ease. With such a power, you can deal with pesky sentinels, chuck projectiles, or set out on scrap expeditions, transporting any big finds back to base to recycle them into rare resources.</p>
<p>And yes, we said "transporting" there. Remnant also introduces a new fleet of trucks, tipping flatbeds and haulers, each of which promises to provide a certain <strong>Truck Simulator</strong> feel to getting from point A to B.</p>
<p>As ever, all of this can be done either alone or online with pals — though a new limited-time community expedition will encourage you to do the latter as you're tasked with clearing up the planet to unlock some sweet cosmetic rewards.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots from Hello Games, showcasing the new additions in action:</p>

<p>Combined with last year's '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-lets-you-design-and-build-your-own-spaceship">Voyagers</a>' update — which let you design and build a spaceship with your online crew — additions like today's make for a neat little bump to No Man's Sky's multiplayer appeal. With a rock-solid Switch 2 version, long may the updates continue!</p>

            <guid>1432258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though catching monsters and making them fight have always been core elements of the Pokémon brand, spinoffs like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Snap</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23902541/detective-pikachu-returns-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a> series have stood out by approaching the franchise from different angles. In different (and often small) ways, recent mainline <em>Pokémon </em>titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/<em> Shield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Legends: Z-A</em></a> have acknowledged that there are some players who would much rather spend their time hanging out and taking pictures with their monster friends.</p><p>That leisurely approach to enjoying the <em>Pokémon </em>world doesn’t exactly gel with the main games’ focus on becoming a competitive champion, but it is exactly the sort of mindset you should have when you start playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777159/pokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a> for the Nintendo Switch 2. Co-developed by The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24346199/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force division</a>, <em>Pokopia </em>feels like Nintendo taking another stab at everything that makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/874895/super-nintendo-book-excerpt-animal-crossing-keza-macdonald"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> so enjoyable while experimenting with features from other crafting-forward games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634690/minecraft-vibrant-visuals-update-minecraft-live"><em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p><p><em>Pokopia </em>uses conventions from the core <em>Pokémon </em>series to make its spin on classic life simulation game mechanics like building and nurturing relationships feel distinct. It’s a fun, cute game that plays <em>just </em>differently enough from <em>Animal Crossing </em>to say that <em>Pokopia </em>isn’t simply a <em>Pokémon</em>-themed <em>New Horizons</em>. But what delighted me most when I recently spent some hands-on time with the game was how — when you look past its bright, island-y vibes — <em>Pokopia</em>’s story seems to be teasing something dark and ominous about the <em>Pokémon</em> world.</p><p>In <em>Pokopia</em>, you play as an unusual Ditto that has somehow ended up on an island after getting separated from its trainer. This Ditto isn’t great at transforming into other pokémon, and it doesn’t remember what happened to its partner. But after finding its lost trainer’s pokédex, the Ditto uses its powers to assume their form (the game’s character customization options are surprisingly robust), and it starts to explore the land around it.</p><p>When I first started playing, I knew that <em>Pokopia</em> was focused on a Ditto in human drag making friends with other pokémon, like Professor Tangrowth, and creating unique habitats to attract more monsters. But I was surprised and intrigued when the grass-type professor explained that it hadn’t seen another living human or pokémon out in “the desolate world” for a very long time.</p><p>After teasing me with the mystery of what happened to everyone, <em>Pokopia </em>dropped me right into a simple bit of gameplay involving a dehydrated Squirtle that covered the basics of how things work on the island. By meeting certain pokémon with special moves like Water Gun, Ditto can copy them and use their powers to affect terrain in the game. When selected, each move — which can only be used a certain number of times before you have to eat to recharge your <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/PP">Power Points</a> — displays a grid of squares letting you know the areas it will affect when used.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><cite>Image: The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, Koei Tecmo Games</cite></span></p></section><p>Hitting patches of dried-up grass with Water Gun turned them vibrant green, and when I’d created enough connected grass squares, they sparkled to let me know that I had created a patch of <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tall_grass">Tall Grass</a>. In <em>Pokopia</em>, your Pokédex registers pokémon and areas like Tall Grass as different kinds of habitats where specific monsters might show up. A timid but friendly Charmander popped out of my first patch of Tall Grass, and its powers were exactly what I needed to start a campfire. The deeper you get into <em>Pokopia</em>, the more complex creating new habitats becomes.</p><p>Some pokémon would only spawn if I created patches of grass shaded by large boulders, while others required me to cultivate fertile ground with wheelbarrows nearby. I had to have already met certain pokémon in order to use the moves necessary to create the conditions that would attract new monsters. And it wasn’t always guaranteed that the exact pokémon I wanted would spawn when their habitat requirements were met.</p><p>The more pokémon you befriend on the island, the more <em>Pokopia </em>begins to open up in terms of space that you can explore and things you can build using <em>Animal Crossing-</em>style recipes and workbenches. I could easily imagine myself spending hours just making places for wild pokémon to relax, but <em>Pokopia </em>is also clearly a game that’s aimed at builders. With the right moves and transformations, you can start doing heavy construction to reshape your island’s geography or travel to other nearby landmasses. Full-on island overhauls might take a while to complete if you’re working by yourself, but the work can go much faster when you’re using <em>Pokopia</em>’s multiplayer mode.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><cite>Image: The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, Koei Tecmo Games</cite></span></p></section><p>During my demo run, my groupmates and I didn’t spend much time trying to complete the objective we were encouraged to focus on as a team because it was much more fun to run around transforming into Dragonites and flying through the air. But if we had been a little more goal-oriented, we could have built some buildings or snapped a few group photos with our conspicuously retro Pokédexes.</p><p>Aside from the foreshadowed desolation, what struck me most about <em>Pokopia </em>was how relaxing its interpolations of classic <em>Pokémon </em>songs were and how expressive the game’s monster animations are. Though the game isn’t voice acted, pokémon’s faces charmingly convey the emotions they’re feeling — sometimes they’re excited to talk to you, sometimes they’re in a bad mood and need cheering up — as you visit them in their new homes. And while I wasn’t able to get a look at just how many pokémon can be befriended in the game, it was clear that a sizable number of them can make appearances on the island.</p><p>Even though it’s clearly aimed at kids, <em>Pokopia </em>feels like the kind of game that’s going to be just as enjoyable for adult <em>Pokémon </em>fans when it hits the Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5th. And if the game’s deeper story is anywhere nearly as dark as it seems, it might be one of the franchise’s most fascinating side stories yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/876285/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1432252</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Imagine E.T. snorted your dad off a space toilet. You’d be mad, but there wouldn’t be anything you could do about it. Unless you happened to have an arsenal of powerful alien guns and some tricked-out power armour. This is the story of you, an unassuming kid who just happens to love video games, and how Earth getting taken over by a vast interstellar drug cartel turns out to be the making of you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life">High on Life</a> start at the outbreak of alien invasion on a seemingly normal day in sleepy suburbia. Your parents are out of town, your cokehead sister, Lizzie, wants to throw a wild party, and all you want to do is lose yourself in a Legally Distinct first person shooter. Relatable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of nowhere arrives the <strong>G3 Cartel</strong>, led by a disgusting slimy slug man called <strong>Garmantuous</strong>; a blob of distorted flesh more hideous than Jabba the Hutt and twice as mean. He’s here because, sadly, human beings are a very potent recreational drug. In a spot of obscenely bad luck, evolutionarily speaking, we just so happen to be like catnip to the various species that make up galactic civilisation. So the G3 cartel is here to enslave us, stick us all in jars, and sell us on street corners, showing absolutely no regard for our rights as sentient beings. They even murder beloved Hollywood stars Jack Black and Susan Sarandon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, an early chance encounter with tips the scales ever so slightly back in humanity’s favour. You meet <strong>Kenny</strong>, a sentient gun from the planet Gatlus. The <strong>Gatlians </strong>are proud race of living weapons who are also enslaved by the cartel, subjected to a brutal bioengineered plague. Any survivors are pressganged into forming the bulk of the cartel’s lethal arsenal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You know, I’m starting to think these guys aren’t very nice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kenny turns out to be an affable young gun with an axe to grind against the cartel and a plan for you both to get even. With his help, you escape the ravaging of Earth by warping your entire house to <strong>Blim City</strong>, an alien metropolis full of gleaming towers, fantastic technology, and, well… pawn shops, criminal gangs, filthy slums, and gobby delinquents. It is a city after all. They’re all Birmingham or Detroit or whatever when you get down to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here’s Kenny's plan: you become a licensed bounty hunter and destroy the G3 cartel’s entire sordid operation by systematically murdering all of its top brass... which involves chaotically murdering much of its bottom brass. All of which is quite impossible without the help of <strong>Gene Zaroothian</strong>: a down-on-his-luck, formerly famous bounty hunter who has at some point resorted to selling his own legs for a bit of quick cash. In exchange for a permanent seat on your couch and custody of the TV remote, he sets you up with the aforementioned Tricked Out Power Armour and the all-important Bounty-5000, a vast alien computer that combines the functions of a contract board and a Stargate. He also sets you up with your first mission: head to the slums, recover Gene’s knife “<strong>Knifey</strong>”, and assassinate <strong>9-Torg</strong>, a local crime boss. And also <strong>5-Torg</strong>, her cloned sister, if you like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not strictly speaking part of the G3 Cartel, 9-Torg’s gang do business with them as drug runners and so it feels perfectly morally consistent to, y’know, murder them all. With Knifey recovered and the associated skills of knife crime and grappling unlocked, your crusade to save humanity from the scum of the universe begins in earnest.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Target 1: Krubis</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-krubis-1770723028361.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Your first target is <strong>Krubis</strong>, the big cheese of G3’s mining operations on the planet Zephyr Paradise, with a thick New Jersey accent and drills for hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mining operation?”, you say? "I thought this was a drug cartel? What could they possibly be mining for?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drugs. They’re mining drugs. Specifically, a living drug called Furgles, another sentient race enjoying the dubious honour of somehow having evolved to give other aliens a really good high when snorted. They tend to live underground in caves, hence all the mining. Furgles share the planet with the Moplets, a race of Despair Bears with scrotums for faces who have been brutally enslaved by Krubis in order to keep the mines running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krubis, however, has a problem. With the discovery of humans, who have proven a much more potent narcotic, the demand for Furgles is set to collapse. He and his product is now fast slipping out of favour with Garmantuous, meaning his position within the G3 Cartel rests on very shakey ground. Which is what happens when you dig too many tunnels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon enough, however, that’s the least of his concerns, because you kill him and take his gun, <strong>Gus</strong>, the JB Smoove voiced frog-faced shotgun with a vacuum function who can shoot large sawblades that you can use as platforms. He’s also the only Gatlian who has arms, which is ironic for a race of arms. You know, <em>arm</em>aments. Ah, forget it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, back home, while Lizzie has been getting into the alien dating scene, Gene has been making himself a bit too comfortable on the couch, and so you find the two at each other’s throats.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Target 2: Douglas</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-douglas-1770723044682.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second G3 target is <strong>Douglas</strong>, the cartel’s head of training. And also torture. And while some level of evil is required to work in recruitment, Douglas’ unrelenting cruelty and hedonism makes him extremely bad at his job, often making new recruits fight each other to the death despite the G3’s existential staffing problems. This, of course, means he’s fast slipping out of favour with Garmantuous, which seems to be a running theme here. How can such a chaotic and badly managed organisation be the dominant criminal conspiracy in the galaxy? It’s almost like someone else is really pulling the strings here...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Douglas is a small, vulnerable octopus creature who is obsessed with setting pointless, arduous training tasks. In disguise as Dr. Joopy, he almost convinces you to lead him back to the power armour he’s accidentally locked himself out of while on a bender, but the ruse is uncovered by Gus, and so you can just shoot him instead of playing his stupid games. Or not. Either way you end up fighting his suit, win, and acquire a new Gatlian companion: <strong>Sweezy</strong>, an obnoxious needler with a nifty time bubble alt fire which can be used to get into air ducts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Target 3: Doctor Giblets</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-giblets-1770723059694.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Clugg Nuggmin</strong>, Blim City’s magistrate, summons you to his office to congratulate you on your campaign against the drug trade, and offers his assistance in rescuing the human race by building a safe haven for your people and a giving you a device to teleport any humans you find directly there. Setting aside for now the high probability of this guy having a nefarious agenda, you proceed to the next assassination mission… stopping briefly to solve another domestic between Gene, Lizzie, and her dipshit boyfriend, Tweeg.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next target? <strong>Doctor Giblets</strong>, the cartel’s deranged warp scientist, who’s currently hiding out on <strong>Zephyr Paradise</strong>. Current intel on Dr. Giblets says he’s gone into hiding after murdering all of his own men, and is in possession of a powerful Gatlian. Upon finding his secret base, however, you find only a <strong>Busted Gatlian</strong>, which is utterly broken and inoperable after being experimented on. Before you can deal righteous revenge on his abuser, though, Giblets accidentally trips over and... dies. Far from saving you the bother of a boss fight, though, this leads to one of the hardest battles in the game in the form of Dr. Giblets’ posthumous revenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Giblets ends up thoroughly dealt with, and the Busted Gatlian is delivered back to Gene to see if anything can be done for them. But Giblets wasn’t the only G3 boss on Zephyr Paradise performing horrific medical experiments.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Target 4: The Skrendel Brothers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-skrendel-1770723074745.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Next on the hit list: the <strong>Skrendel Brothers</strong>, overseers of Skrendel Labs, a vast drug facility where the cartel are experimenting on humans in order to increase their potency. On the way there you rescue another Gatlian, <strong>Creature</strong>, and learn of the nasty experiments that have turned him into a gun that is permanently pregnant, capable of shooting his own offspring as projectiles. What is it with these guys and horrific medical experiments?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Skrendel Bros are a compound being of triplets who combine into an ultra form during your final battle with them, which they obviously lose. By now you’ve become enough of a thorn in the cartel’s side to garner the attention of Garmantuous himself, who warns you to back off, with the implication that your long lost parents will be harmed if you don’t. However, it actually turns out that Garmantuous has Hollywood’s beloved Jack Black and Susan Sarandon, not your parents, in one of the game’s funniest twists and long-form gags. Which I completely spoiled in the intro to this recap. Hey, look, if you were bothered about spoilers, you wouldn’t be reading a recap, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, it turns out that the busted Gatlian is a former resistance leader by the name of <strong>Lezduit</strong>, who's now a shadow of his former self due to mistreatment, but is still a hugely powerful firearm. However, it seems that he has a troubled past with Kenny...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blim City Invasion</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-tweeg-rv-1770723092842.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be a video game without a perilous third act where you nearly lose everything. Firstly, Lizzie has gone missing, and so you head to <strong>Space Applebees</strong> in the slums where her boyfriend, Tweeg, works as a cook. That’s right, there’s a Space Applebees, in one of the funniest and most unlikely pieces of product placement ever featured in video games. This would be like having a licensed OMEGA watch in a Bond game that you only ever see covered in shit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Applebees, Kenny takes one of the game’s rare quiet moments to explain his unwitting part in the downfall of the Gatlian race, confessing that he became the personal firearm of a G3 smuggler and ended up, through cowardice and incompetence, leading the Cartel directly back to his home planet, triggering a war which his people lost due to a genetically engineered disease that turned most of them catatonic. Feeling the a huge strain from this guilt, Kenny vows to save humanity to atone for the genocide of his people. Which is all pretty heavy stuff for a daft Rick and Morty first-person shooter, but the pathos is regularly interrupted by an Applebees waiter just to keep things as light as possible. This is, without a doubt, the best bit in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on, it turns out Tweeg is a G3 agent tasked with infiltrating your home by romancing Lizzie and gaining her trust. He’s seen kidnapping her in his space RV and fleeing Blim City, but before you can chase, the place is overrun with Cartel, forcing a hasty escape involving once again warping your house  to a new location. This time, you arrive on the toxic ruins of Gatlus, the home planet of the Gatlians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lizzie’s fine, by the way.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Target 5: Nipulon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-nipulon-1770723111210.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The penultimate boss is <strong>Nipulon</strong>: Garmantuous’s right hand man and the G3’s chief of customer relations. He runs an infamous drug den and is, contrary to the wisdom of most high-level operatives in the illegal drug trade, partial to his own merchandise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, of course, like Batman’s Scarecrow or a tired parent with access to kid-grade Tylenol, Nipulon is skilled in weaponising drugs. This leads to one of the trippiest boss fights in modern gaming, in which we learn that, no matter the odds, any challenge can be overcome with the power of teamwork. And that handling firearms while intoxicated can sometimes lead to a positive outcome. Actually, you know what, I don’t think there is a moral to this story, it’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Finish the Fight</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/high-on-life-garmantuous-1770723129618.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After dispatching Nipulon, Gene manages to save the powerful Gatlian Lezduit from oblivion: with no more guns to collect and no more upgrades to purchase, the only thing left to do is return to Earth and kill Garmantuous, permanently ending the tyranny of the G3 Cartel once and for all and saving the human race from the ignoble fate of becoming ecstasy for ALF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the firepower of Lezduit won’t quite be enough to take down Gamantuous, however. The only way to kill this crime lord, surmises Gene, is to ram a bomb up his backside. And so, at the climax of a prolonged Bullet Hell battle, with an incapacitated Garmantuous showing his entire ass metaphorically and literally, the butt bomb enema fails to explode. The remote detonator is faulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the game’s punchline requires you to sacrifice one of your newfound friends by pushing them up the villain’s anus. A fitting end for the galaxy’s biggest asshole, for sure. The only question is: who to sacrifice?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most prudent choice is Kenny, given how this noble sacrifice completes his redemption arc, but it doesn’t really matter because your choice is immediately undermined when it turns out that whichever gun you cast into the void immediately comes back after surviving the resulting explosion.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right: Oh my god, they <em>don’t</em> kill Kenny. Except they might as well have done, because when the High on Knife DLC rolls around his character gets unceremoniously written out with a bit of exposition, for reasons that are beyond the remit of this recap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incidentally, the major revelations from the DLC are: Knifey is not a type of melee Gatlian but a native of the planet Australia 2, hailing from a race of pacifist knives who can’t stand him. And also that getting rid of the dysfunctional G3 Cartel doesn’t actually make humanity any safer from the intergalactic drug trade, but we already figured that out from the secret ending of the base game, in which the big villainous mastermind behind it all is revealed to be <strong>Dr. Gurgula</strong>. He's found in the bowels of the Human Haven set up by Magistrate Clugg, ostensibly to help you save your people but actually to recapture them and provide human subjects to Dr. Gurgula for even more horrible experiments. The game is pretty unequivocal that this reveal is a tease for the sequel, in which you, your sister, Gene, and at least some of the returning Gatlians are fugitives on the run from galactic authorities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that is the entire story of High on Life, or at least the stuff you actually need to know before you play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-story-recap]]></content:encoded>

Pokémon Pokopia might be about to eclipse them all.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy an extended look at Pokémon Pokopia! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-BOgDkTpD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The initial announcement of Pokémon Pokopia brought with it a fair bit of hand-wringing from the most diehard lore experts of the franchise. Ditto hasn’t been able to mimic a human form before, so why can it do so now? Also, isn’t this the stuff of horror films? But to question this game is to forget the most important thing: it’s all make-believe and honestly shouldn’t bother you after that initial head-tilting “Wait, what?” moment. This initial oddity is immediately brushed aside as you try to figure out what has actually happened to the wider world. Ditto wakes up all alone in a cave and decides to copy the shape and form of the trainer that they know and love as a self-soothing act. After some jelly-armed Naruto running, you’ll bump into Professor Tangrowth and be shepherded through to the world outside, the questions start to grow. Where are all the people? How has this land become such a desolate waste, ruined Pokémon Centre and all? What do we do now?</p>


<p>The answer to that is pretty obvious: you need to rebuild, you need to nurture, and create a paradise for all the Pokémon you can find and befriend.</p>


<p>Ditto is the perfect character for this job. Meeting a Squirtle on the verge of dehydration, you’re able to learn Water Gun and provide them with some water. Prof. Tangrowth comments on your latent transformation ability – pulling off this move doesn’t turn you into a Squirtle copy, but just sprouts a tail from your more human form, and this carries through to all the other abilities you learn, from Bulbasaur’s Leafage sprouting from your back, to Scyther’s Cut turning arms into vicious blades and beyond. Later moves, such as a Lapras Surf and Draginite’s Glide enhancing your movement skills, show that full transformations are possible, but I guess you’ve got to build up to that.</p>
<p>Of course, you need to meet new Pokémon in order to learn their moves, and that’s where a key part of the exploration and rebuilding comes into focus. You need to provide to each Pokémon’s base desires and habitat in order to draw them in, and in order to discover what that might be, you need to find the sparkling clues within the world. Bulbasaur wants a nice big patch of tall grass, Scyther needs a bit of shaded grass by a tree, and if you’ve got a punching bag next to a bench? Well, that’s perfect for Hitmonchan to get their workout routine going. It’s a bit nebulous getting this to happen, and you then need to keep an eye out for a rustle in the grass or other sign that a Pokémon has emerged, but after that you can befriend them and bring them into your growing community.</p>

<p>To earn their friendship, you’ll need to complete a simple task for them, at which point you can learn their key move, but that’s not the end of your interactions. As you start to explore the desolate world, you happen across a Poké Centre with a computer terminal, and Professor Tangrowth suggests that you might want to restore it – perhaps the humans will come back? This needs resources, it needs bricks and wood and other things, and so you can start to build little production lines with the Pokémon that have the relevant skills to meet the requirements. Far from a Factorio situation, there appears to be a relatively light touch to construction and crafting, though you’ll need to supply both materials and then ask Pokémon to follow you and fill the key jobs for the building effort.</p>
<p>There’s a simple charm to all of this, and it certainly feels more goal-oriented than Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There’s better comparisons to Dragon Quest Builders for the cubist look and feel of the environments and gameplay – perhaps with Omega Force able to draw upon experience making DQB2 with Square Enix – and to Viva Piñata for the way that you curate the environment to bring Pokémon to your lands.</p>

<p>There’s also some great multiplayer support that really shows some of the shortcomings of Animal Crossing online. Other players can visit your game world and save, but then they can take full part in completing missions, messing around and transforming the world. We got to play as a foursome, tasked with rebuilding another Poké Centre, but quickly got distracted by the set of later game abilities that we suddenly had, letting us fly off to a completely different part of the map and a town for Pokémon. Once again, it’s funny to see how the Pokémon are adapting to a human-less world, able to move into houses, whether they were left behind when people vanished, or were something that you built. We spent so much time running around and exploring that we had a hurried five-minute scramble toward the end of our session to try and figure out a way to actually build that Poké Centre.</p>
<p>Our solution? Grind our way through all of the sand on the beaches of these separated islands, filling our pockets and then build a thin land bridge between the two, meeting in the middle like the engineers of the Channel Tunnel and then escorting the Pokémon we needed across. Alas, our time with the game ran out just before we were able to complete the goal, but that really just left me wanting more.</p>

<p>Pokémon Pokopia is shaping up to be much more than I expected it to be. The Animal Crossing comparisons are inevitable, from how much of the UI and even the tone of the music feels to be borrowed from New Horizons, but it’s far too surface-level for a game that is more proactive and faster to evolve over hours instead of days and weeks. I’m still unsure how the story will develop through the course of the game, or how multiplayer will hold up for longer play sessions, but there’s an awful lot of potential here, and I absolutely can’t wait to play more.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear</link>
            <guid>1432210</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>There was a moment quite early into my time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> where I sat back, exhaled, and said, <em>“Oh dear, it’s got me.”</em></p>
<p>See, I’ve not been too hot on Pokémon games for a while now, and initial trailers for Pokopia suggested that this probably wouldn’t be changing anytime soon. After spending 90 minutes with both single-player and multiplayer components at Nintendo of Europe's Frankfurt offices, however, I’m convinced: Pokopia — which has Koei Tecmo's Omega Force of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-warriors-games-every-switch-musou-game-ranked">Warriors</a> fame heading up development — is going to absolutely gobble up my time.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if it's supported by a steady stream of post-launch content (maybe some cool crossover items or events with other Nintendo properties?), it has the potential to be <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>I could tell you that Pokopia is basically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> with Pokémon, but that wouldn’t be entirely accurate. The vibes are there, at least; the music, the dialogue, the adorable animations… It’s <em>very</em> Animal Crossing in its presentation.</p>
<p>But in terms of gameplay, you’re looking at a blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and — bizarrely — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/viva_pinata">Viva Piñata</a> (an underrated gem if there ever was one). And yes, a sprinkling of Animal Crossing, too.</p>

<p>You start off by creating your character: a Ditto taking on the (loose) form of a human. You can customise your skin colour, hairstyle/colour, and clothing - there’s not a massive array of options to choose from, but it’s enough to get you going. Once you’re done, you’re introduced to Professor Tangrowth, the sole resident Pokémon in a desolate, run-down world.</p>
<p>Tangrowth tasks you with restoring life to the environment, but in order to do that, you’ll need Pokémon – lots of Pokémon. But lo, behold! A Squirtle has conveniently appeared. After a quick chat (yes, all of the Pokémon here can talk – you’re not special anymore, Meowth), your Ditto character can mimic Squirtle’s Water Gun ability, enabling you to revitalise the ground, grass, bushes, and trees to flourish once more.</p>
<p>Once you’ve revived a sizeable patch of grass, a Bulbasaur will then appear and grant you the Leafage ability. This essentially lets you instantly plant patches of grass at will, letting you start customising the environment to your liking while also creating unique habitats for more Pokémon.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8f0aa2d60bc51"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f0aa2d60bc51/pokemon-pokopia-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s the main hook of Pokopia. You don’t catch Pokémon here, but rather foster the right habitats to coax more of them into your vicinity. Some of the earliest creatures, like Bulbasaur and Charmander, merely require a bit of grass, but the requirements soon get more complex.</p>
<p>The key is to keep an eye out for a small, twinkling animation on the ground. When you interact with this, you're shown a brief description of the habitat required to reveal a new Pokémon. Scyther (who teaches you Cut, by the way) needs grass sheltered underneath a tree, while Hitmonchan shows up after you’ve placed a punching bag next to a wooden bench. I’ve only seen a fraction of what the full game will offer, and I’m eager to see how it balances player freedom with creating specific, curated habitats. So far, there seems to be a strong focus on creativity, and that’s great.</p>
<p>Creating habitats is just the first step – you’ll also need to make sure your Pokémon are feeling comfortable in their new homes. This is where crafting comes in. By gathering materials (rocks, lumber, leaves, and more), you can start hammering away at the crafting bench to create brand new items. This could be a straw bed for your Bulbasaur, a stool to sit and admire your handiwork, or even street lamps.</p>

<p>The section I played was literally the start of the game, so it was difficult to gauge what kind of items you'll be able to create further down the line, but hopefully it’ll give New Horizons a run for its money. Needless to say, completing small tasks to boost the Pokémon's environments took me right back to my Xbox 360 in 2006 and getting my animals to perform their romance dances in Viva Piñata. You won't see such dances here, but the vibes are certainly similar.</p>
<p>Overall, Pokopia's onboarding process is painless and incredibly fun. It really felt like I was making meaningful progress with each new tutorial, and unlike some mainline entries over the years, it mercifully doesn't talk you to death. You get the basics, then you're free to just go off and do your own thing. Bliss.</p>
<p>After tinkering around with the single-player portion, I then sampled a three-player session over LAN. Here, we were dropped into a much more substantial area split into two distinct islands. Our goal was to rebuild a Pokémon Centre, the requirements of which included a bunch of crafting materials, but also specific Pokémon, including Dragonite, Lapras, Espeon, and a few unknown creatures designated only by their key abilities.</p>

<p>Gathering the leaves and lumber was easy. We divided up the responsibilities, split up, and completed our hunt in minutes. Gathering the required Pokémon, however, was trickier. Some of them resided on another island located across a short stretch of water, so you can just head over (you can literally either turn into Lapras or Dragonite at this point), talk to them, and get them to follow you.</p>
<p>The problem is that many of them can't cross water, so you'll need to start destroying blocks within the environment, gather the resulting materials, and build bridges from one island to the other. Again, it might just be a result of playing an isolated segment of the game with no additional context, but it didn't explicitly tell us we needed to build a bridge - we just figured it out, and for a Pokémon game, it delivered a wonderful sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>As for the unknown Pokémon, just like the single-player portion, specific habitats were needed to coax them into the environment. These were much more complex, however, and required scouring through each island to locate specific items. Ultimately, we weren't able to finish rebuilding the Pokémon Centre before our time was up - a good sign that Pokopia may provide some challenge when it wants to.</p>

<p>Ultimately, despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations, Pokopia was a huge surprise which had me grinning ear to ear. It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon. This feels like exactly what I needed to get me back into Pokémon, and I sincerely can't wait to dive into the full game.</p>

It'll also feature full cross-platform save support, so you'll be able to pick up on Android wherever you left off on a different device.</p>



<p>As for the game's technical requirements, you'll need an Android device running <strong>64-bit Android OS 12.0 or higher on an ARM64 processo</strong>r, with a minimum of <strong>4GB of RAM</strong>.</p>



<p>If you have a device ready to go that meets all of those requirements, then you'll also be treated to Android-exclusive rewards by getting the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong> if you sign in on Android before <strong>March 4, 2026.</strong> You'll get a special weapon and armour cosmetics, as well as resource boosters to help kick-start your time on Android.</p>



<p>This past December, Digital Extremes released yet another major expansion for Warframe, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/">The Old Peace</a></strong>, which introduced a new narrative chapter in Warframe's storyline.

<p>The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/remnant-update/">update</a>, dubbed Remnant, is the first one Hello Games have put out this year. It turns the salvage that's been strewn about on planets for a while into something you can gather up and recycle at Waste Processing Plants for "rare and highly prized resources".</p>
<p>In line with that, the update's two major additions are a multi-tool module dubbed the Gravitino Coil and customisable trucks to haul the rubbish you pick up. In practice, you run around launching the likes of trashed tyres and hunks of metal onto your lorry's flatbed, optionally yelling 'Kobe!' with every successful landing. Then, once you reach the processing plant, you lob the waste into machines with big grinding rollers to break it down. Naturally, there's the option to work as part of a waste cleanup team if you fancy bringing some mates along.</p><p>"Some of the scrap is highly volatile though and must be transported extremely carefully," Hello Games' Sean Murray explained. "It’s hard to resist over-stacking your truck, finding one more piece you think you can cram in, and then trying desperately to transport this house of cards on the back of your flatbed!" Ah, so maybe don't just Kobe it all into the trailer from half a mile away then.</p>
<p>The gravity gun can also be used as a weapon if you run into anyone who fancies nicking your loot, assuming you've got stuff you don't mind flinging at such assailants. The space trucks are customisable too, with options like tank tracks, wheels, or spindly legs allowing you to design the ideal ride for tackling a specific planet's terrain. So yeah, NMS is a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> with aliens now. I look forward to rolling my space truck following a carelessly taken turn, then spending half an hour lying to myself that I'll be able to get back on track if I can just lever the thing back ont-. Ah, it's fallen off a cliff.</p>
<p>The Remnant update is out now. We've got you covered if you're thinking of hopping in for the first time in a while and so need quick refreshers as to what last year's bunch of No Man's Sky updates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-adds-ship-wreck-salvaging-for-new-bits-to-stick-on-your-own-craft-with-the-breach-update">added</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-adds-in-big-custom-ships-crewed-by-you-and-your-mates">to</a> the near decade old interstellar exploration game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Last Caretaker’s ‘Final Frontier’ Update Adds New Vehicle, Locations, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-caretaker-final-frontier-update/</link>
            <guid>1432195</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-last-caretaker/" id="3556">The Last Caretaker</a> is currently unfolding in early access and impressing gamers worldwide. It’s an ambitious, emotional game that presents players with the utmost freedom, sending them into a world devastated by rising oceans and tasking them with preserving the remnants of humanity, hundreds of years after they’ve left the planet.</p>



<p>Channel37, the game’s developer, has just unveiled the bulk of The Final Frontier, the game’s second major update since it was released in December 2025 in early access. It’s fairly accurate to say this update is <strong>huge</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-ways-to-sail-new-places-to-sail-to">New Ways to Sail, New Places to Sail To</h2>



<p>The Final Frontier has just been released, marking the arrival of the second major expansion to The Last Caretaker. Despite the name, it’s just the beginning for this open-world sandbox, which we recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/the-last-caretaker-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded a 9/10 in our full review</a>.</p>



<p>The update starts with new ways to explore the game. Players are tasked with finding a new location, ‘Rocky Islands’, which leads to them unlocking the CS-17 Courier Skimmer, a <strong>Jet Ski</strong>-type craft. This is contained within a whole new biome that itself contains more quests to uncover.</p>



<p>Additionally, Channel37 has added ‘The Maze’, a tricky facility that’s not hard to find, but is hard to escape from once you’re lost within. That, too, contains more quest lines to discover.</p>



<p>The order of the day with The Final Frontier is deeper customization, and with that in mind, players can tweak their all-important vessel with 37 paint styles, all of which are free to find around the world. Additionally, new tools, such as the ‘deep ocean floor sonar’, have been added.</p>



<p>Channel37 has introduced a stack of quality-of-life improvements and adjustments with The Final Frontier, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Better building visualization and snapping</li>



<li>New dismantling visuals per material</li>



<li>Animation and usability improvements</li>



<li>Improved underwater visibility</li>



<li>More data logs to find</li>



<li>New achievements</li>



<li>Performance and stability upgrades across physics, rendering, buoyancy, cables, and UI</li>
</ul>



<p>The Final Frontier is totally free to download and explore, and it represents the second in a very long line of updates planned for The Last Caretaker.</p>
