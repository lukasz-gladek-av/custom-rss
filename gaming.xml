            <p>
Gamescom begins today, Tuesday August 19th 2025, with Opening Night Live - the annual livestream showcase of trailers, teasers and release date announcements, in which helpless videogames are dragged on-stage and hacked into 90-second gobbets by Geoff Keighley. 
</p>
<p>
You can watch Gamescom Opening Night Live on this very page, care of the below video embed. The show begins at <strong>2pm EDT, 11 am PDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST</strong>, and should last around two hours, because that's approximately as long as the summoning magic can keep Geoff bound to our mortal plane. There's also a pre-show at <strong>1.30pm EDT, 10.30am PDT, 6.30pm BST, and 7.30pm CEST</strong>, but nothing noteworthy ever happens in those. Prove me wrong, host Kyle Boseman!

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance will receive DLC themed around iconic SEGA villains next year, it has been revealed, with the release date rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Set to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-release-date-revealed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, rebooting the Shinobi franchise that has lain dormant since 2011.</p>



<p>The initial release is not the end of the road, however, with plans to support the title moving forward with additional content, and the first DLC has been revealed.</p>



<h2 id="h-sega-villains-stage-to-release-early-2026">SEGA Villains Stage to Release Early 2026</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.sega.com/news/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-dlc-speedrun-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SEGA announced</a> the SEGA Villains Stage will be released in early 2026, featuring iconic Sonic the Hedgehog villain Dr. Eggman, with two additional villains due to be announced.</p>



<p>Although a precise release date for the DLC was not shown, more news could be on the horizon as the release date edges closer, and the news continues SEGA’s heavy crossover content.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing Crossworlds, another SEGA title due to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 25</a>, has already announced that characters from Minecraft, Persona, SpongeBob SquarePants, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will feature.</p>



<p>SEGA’s push to revive its dormant franchises, like Shinobi, after over 14 years, could bring a new audience to the title, particularly with additional crossover content.</p>



<p>The announcement also included details of a Speedrun challenge to celebrate the upcoming launch, with players competing to set the best completion times in Shinobi 3: Return of the Ninja Master and the demo for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> clown image has become a popular meme around every possible Silksong re-reveal, fans posting it every time they get their hopes up only for them to be dashed at lack of new info.</p>


<p>We already know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable at Gamescom</a> on the show floor, so it's not a massive leap to expect to see it kick off the show at ONL. Whether or not we get a release date alongside new gameplay, well, that might be asking for a lot, but if the game is going to release in 2025 we'd expect to be getting that info in the near future.</p>
<p>Gamescom ONL kicks off properly at 7pm BST today, with a pre-show expected beforehand.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-has-free-rein-to-create-original-characters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-has-free-rein-to-create-original-characters.1273446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developer Netease has free rein to create and introduce original characters to the game, it has been confirmed.</p>



<p>Though the game already boasts a stacked roster of fan-favorite characters, alongside an almost endless list of Marvel names that could be brought into the fray, the door is open for the developers to create original characters.</p>



<p>Confirmation came via game director Guangguang, who didn’t confirm whether it was something Netease has planned, but it was clear there was a possibility—though it remains to be seen whether it could happen in the next year, a period in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-devs-have-a-years-worth-of-characters-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters have already been prepared</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-stay-tuned-for-marvel-rivals-original-characters">‘Stay Tuned’ For Marvel Rivals Original Characters</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Original characters could be created. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Guangguang adopted his customary “stay tuned” response when asked if original characters were planned to be introduced, but confirmed Marvel has given permission for them to be created.</p>



<p>Though this might seem surprising given Marvel Rivals has over seven decades of comic book history and characters to fall back upon, it wouldn’t be the first time a new Marvel character has been introduced in a video game.</p>



<p>Luna Snow, who has become one of the most popular characters in Marvel Rivals, is the best example, having been created for Marvel Future Fight before making a comic book debut in 2019.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has shown that it can bring lesser-known characters into the limelight to become household names, as shown by the popularity of Jeff the Land Shark, so there’s every chance an original character could make waves.</p>



<p>Another example of a successful character being introduced outside of comic books comes from DC with Harley Quinn, who is now one of the most popular characters under the DC umbrella. She was first introduced in the Batman Animated Series in the 1990s.</p>

            <p>PC gamers who are hoping Capcom updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to improve performance will have to wait a little longer. A statement made on <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">X.com</a> via the official Monster Hunter account has told players that improvements are coming, but not until this winter.</p>
<blockquote><p>To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game.</p>
<p>Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards.</p>
<p>We'll share more information on the specifics in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news comes alongside the release of <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.02.00.html">Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00</a>, which has dropped on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00 details:</p>
<p>Bug Fixes and Balance Adjustments</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that reduced the invulnerability window upon successfully performing the long sword's Iai Spirit Slash against monster attacks that have long hit detection durations.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the Item Bar Display option is set to Type 1, if you select an item using the Item Bar while in Aim/Focus Mode and then release Aim/Focus Mode, the selected item would revert to an empty slot.</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-trailer-leak-confirms-release-date-vault-edition-and-%E2%80%98mega-jump%E2%80%99-boost-pack.1273431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed users have found an ad for Black Ops 7 that seems to have aired too early, promoting the game’s pre-order availability, release date, and Vault Edition pack. In the short, fifteen-second ad, we get a first look at boost jump abilities, a mission containing hulking mech suits, and some kind of dream sequence pitting players against a human enemy several storeys tall.</p>



<p>This ad was mistakenly released mere hours before Black Ops 7 is set to be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-release-date-confirmed-in-leaked-ad">Black Ops 7 Release Date Confirmed in Leaked Ad</h2>



<p>On social media, users started circulating a screengrab of an ad for Black Ops 7. In this fifteen-second clip, we see highly vertical combat aided by ‘mega jump’ boost packs, <strong>not </strong>jetpacks. In the sequences that unfold, the player character leaps high into the air and coasts over the battlefield, which is a representation of the traversal in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>We also see a snippet of a mission showing a fight against an enormous and heavily armed mech. In classic Black Ops style, things appear to get a little trippy as the player is forced into a battle against a Galactus-sized enemy in what looks like a dream sequence.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer (might have been removed by the time you read this):</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screen grab is low resolution, but we get a look at the Vault Edition components, too. It looks like the skins that were previously leaked, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/">the Reznov Challenge Pack</a>, are all coming. When you pre-order, you’ll get early access to the beta, but the date for that test wasn’t revealed.</p>



<p>The release date was confirmed as November 14, which was suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">in an earlier leak</a>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Play like it's 1999</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive has called on physical distributor Limited Run Games to help out with its latest hard copy release. This time it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and apart from the standard physical version, there'll also be a classic "Big Box Edition" on offer.</p>
<p>This will be available for Switch, PlayStation 5 and PC and is priced at $69.99 (or your regional equivalent), with pre-orders opening on 22nd August 2025 and closing on 21st September 2025. This package comes with the game, a booklet (for console only), soundtrack, keychain and a double-sided poster. Here's a look:</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3011afcd46c52/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games, Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The standard physical release available for Switch and PS5 will be priced at $39.99, with pre-orders opening and closing on the same date.</p>

<p>This game originally launched on Nintendo's eShop in July for $29.99 / £23.99, and we thought the remaster was the best way to play this sci-fi horror FPS. If we hear about anything else related to System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster physical release, we'll let you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"System Shock 2's immersive mechanics will keep you hooked from start to finish, with Nightdive's enhancements and supplemental material providing ample bonus points. Now go play it, insect."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Here's the official comparison</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco recently confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a> to Nintendo platforms later this year, and it's now <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-details-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-frame-rate-and-resolution-official-comparison/">provided an official comparison</a> update on its Japanese website.</p>
<p>Here's how the new Unreal Engine 5 entry will supposedly perform on both the Switch and Switch 2. If we hear any developments about the game's performance and resolution for either platform between now and its November release, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, on Switch 2, the gameplay in Sparking! ZERO apparently runs at a maximum resolution of 810p (varying, depending on dynamic resolution) and is 30fps across both docked and portable modes. Additionally, this version of the game supports HDR.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch version, its gameplay will supposedly be "fixed" at 720p in docked and 480p in handheld, with both modes running at 30fps (although it's apparently "24fps in some menus").</p>
<p>The Nintendo versions of the game will also include local multiplayer and motion controls. There will be a Switch update as well for the physical and digital versions of the title, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco has also released some comparison screenshots of the Switch and Switch 2 versions which you can see below.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bac07c3f2b59f/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received a new update this week, bumping the Switch 2 exclusive up to Version 1.2.1.</p>
<p>This is the first update for August, and it's a small one compared to the previous updates, addressing some bug fixes. As usual, to continue playing online, you'll need to install this latest update.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's Japanese support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Version 1.2.1 (19th August 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where selecting "Ghost and Race" or "Watch Replay" immediately after downloading a ghost in "Time Attack" in "View Ranking" would cause a different Ghost to play than the one you downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need the latest updated data to play online elements.</p>
<p>If you download Ver. 1.2.1, you will not be able to use "local communication" and "LAN play" with users of Ver. 1.1.2 or earlier.</p>
<hr>
<p>If we hear anything else about this update, we'll be sure to let you know. The previous update, Version 1.2.0 included a bunch of adjustments and multiple bug fixes. You can find out more about this in our existing post here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Morsels, a top-down creature-collecting rougelike shooter from indie developer Furcula and publisher Annapurna Interactive, has a November 18, 2025 release date, the two companies announced today.</p>



<p>The unique and self-described "<em>oddball</em>" game was first showcased at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August 2024 and will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch when it arrives this coming November.</p>



<p><a href="https://furcula.ca/">Furcula</a> is a new Toronto-based indie developer, with Morsels being the studio's debut title from a three-person team made up of artist Toby Dixon, musician Sam Webster, and designer and programmer Iggy Zuk.</p>



<p>You play as a little mouse, diving into the sewers for scraps, who happens upon a magical frog-looking creature called a fatberg that transforms you into a Morsel, and grants you the power to swap between other Morsels you find along your journey, switching from one to the next to try and meet your situation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MORSELS | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fy4A0vHr6GU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I played Morsels earlier this year as part of my <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest round-up for the June 2025 Next Fest</a>, and highlighted it as my favorite of the demos I played while the festival was on. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</em>"</p>



<p>Thankfully for me, it will indeed be arriving this year, and thankfully for you, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">demo is still available to play on Steam</a> if you want to check it out ahead of release.</p>

There are four bosses and boss battles across 81 levels, with multiple secrets to discover along the way.</p><p>Allen has also shared a trailer for his next solo-dev game, Vein-Weaver Knitting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-dm-release-date-in-october" rel="nofollow">Critical Role not only announced the release date of their hotly anticipated Campaign 4</a>, October 4th, but also that Matthew Mercer would be joining the table this time around as a player and not as the GM. The role of GM would go to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>, and Campaign 4 would be set in a completely new setting.</p>



<p>Last Thursday at the bottom of the regular Beacon and Critical Role newsletter an interesting image was included of a five by five square of letters, clicking on which would lead you to join the Beacon Discord and access the #what-do-you-seek channel.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-setting-5x5-letters.jpg?itok=Y4MBwSAS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-setting-5x5-letters.jpg?itok=aDrTvph2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This led puzzle hunters down the rabbit hole to share word of this ARG, hunt for any other clues, and ultimately the answer. This puzzle was solved earlier today and led to the discovery of a secret page on the Critical Role website that contained a password field, and the password itself.</p>

<p>Travelling to <a href="https://critrole.com/unseal" rel="nofollow">https://critrole.com/unseal</a> and entering the password ARAMAN (in all capital letters) eager fans can get access to a 20 second recording of Brennan Lee Mulligan setting the scene for Campaign 4. The audio is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Within the world of Araman, there exists a growing darkness in the shadow of revolution. Seventy years ago were the Shapers cut down, those seven lords of creation that saw fit to cast their children into ruin and shadown forever..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accompanying this audio file is the date: <strong>August 21st, 2025 10am PT</strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of questions left to answer about Campaign 4 including who will be joining Matt and Brennan at the table, and what game system will be used. One or both of those might be answers on August 21st.</p>

At GamesCom later this week, Funcom will debut new details about September's free update for Chapter 2 and the paid DLC, The Lost Harvest. These updates won't modify the endgame content of Awakening, because they were in development before the game launched.</p><p>The free updates for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 will arrive between January and March 2026 and April and June 2026, respectively. Details about Chapter 4 are scarce, but Chapter 3 will feature a revamped endgame.

Another new service will update players on the status of their bases via email.</p><p>Awakening's 2026 paid DLCs, Raiders of the Broken Lands and The Water Wars, will arrive in the first and second quarters of the year, respectively.

                <p>A Fortnite Creative map caused a stir over the weekend by being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s most popular individual mode for a short period of time. Steal the Brainrot, a user-made competitive tycoon map that was ripped off from a massively popular Roblox game, managed to pull in just over 183,000 concurrent players on Sunday, making it the top mode in Epic's metaverse for a couple hours, and sparking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a conversation</a> among players about what's going on.</p><p>Those are impressive numbers for a Creative island, though it's not <em>truly</em> accurate that it ever was the top Fortnite mode--the reality is that it peaked at number 3. At the time that Steal the Brainrot hit its top mark of 183k concurrent players, Fortnite's main Battle Royale mode had more than 300,000 people playing, split between build, Zero Build, and ranked. Likewise, Reload had about 200k players at the time spread across its variants. On Sunday, Epic even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNdhHZ8yOxz/?hl=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">promoted the game on its social channels</a>.</p><p>In terms of how it stacks up against other Creative maps, Steal the Brainrot is only the third Creative island to pull at least 183k concurrent players. The top mark ever comes courtesy of the deathmatch map Super Red vs Blue, which had 235k players at once in May.</p><p>It's hard to say exactly why Steal the Brainrot blew up like it did on Sunday, but the mode has been steadily popular since it launched in early July. The Roblox version, called Steal a Brainrot, is currently Roblox's <a href="https://www.roblox.com/charts#/sortName/top-playing-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">third most-popular game</a>, as it regularly averages <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/109983668079237/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than a million players</a> at a time. Considering the <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3064994/roblox-stock-tanks-after-surge-of-lawsuits-and-global-bans?r=caf6fe0e0db70d936033da5461e60141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">massive amount of legal heat Roblox is facing</a> at the moment, it could be that Fortnite is catching some players who are leaving that much more popular metaverse experience.</p>

That includes support for HyperSpeed Wireless 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections, a multi-function roller and 11 control buttons for easy access to your most-used controls, and textured doubleshot PBT keycaps that are built to be more durable than standard ABS caps. It also benefits from up to 980 hours of battery life, so you should always be ready for your next gaming session.</span></p><p>It should also come as no surprise that the keyboard is littered with RGB lights, so you can light it up with millions of different colors. Some games are integrated with Razer Chroma, allowing them to automatically change the lighting based on the in-game situation.</p><p>Razer rounds out the BlackWidow V4 Low Profile with a top-mounted steel plate for added durability, internal foam for reduced reverberation, and a low front height of just 18.5mm. So if you enjoy the slim form-factor of low-profile keyboards, this looks to combine the tiny footprint with the impressive gaming chops of the much larger V4 keyboards.</p><p>Opt for yellow switches to get a 1.2mm actuation distance requiring 40g of force, or the orange switches for a 1.6mm actuation distance requiring 45g of force.

However, it's missing the numpad, giving you a smaller footprint and freeing up space on your desk for sweeping mouse movements. You'll also lose a few control buttons (dropping from 11 to 3). It's a great option for a dedicated gaming station (or folks working with limited desktop real estate), and it doesn't hurt that you'll save $30, too.</span></p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>The Low Profile lineup joins several existing BlackWidow V4 keyboards.

While it's pricier than other models, that premium price tag is worth it based on our experience. The keyboard uses an aluminium chassis, doubleshot ABS keycaps, and an assortment of cool extras like features per-key RGB lighting, a magnetic plush wrist rest (also with RGB underglow lighting), and eight programmable macro keys. It's also available in three switch options, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0BT3VC25K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0D4NMMFXB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orange</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0BV4BC7LV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yellow</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for a wireless option, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Swappable/dp/B0FD5276Z6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlackWidow V4 TKL Wireless</a> model that's available for $180, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Swappable-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DD5Q6XX9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">V4 Mini Wireless</a> for $130. Both keyboards are smaller-sized models with fewer keys and streamlined layouts, making for a much more compact footprint on your desk--a nice complement to their wireless designs. The TKL option is slightly larger, while the mini is the smallest option available.</p><p>There's also the BlackWidow V4 X, a wired full-size keyboard available in multiple color options, including themed editions.

                <p>PlayStation is reportedly planning a live stream, either a State of Play or a showcase, for September.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb, who shared the information during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7KYP00kf4GM?si=4ofUddvkpykWVKG0&amp;t=1202">Game Mess Mornings</a>, PlayStation is planning on having a live stream during September. While Grubb said it will most likely be a State of Play and not a showcase, with the latter having a longer run time and more games featured, but he did not rule out a showcase as a possibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Grubb did not discuss any games he had specifically heard would be featured during the live stream, however the information came up during a discussion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/">Fairgames</a>, one of PlayStation's in development live-service games. Grubb said he did not expect Fairgames to make an appearance during the show. Ghost of Yotei releases on October 2, so it could make an appearance during a September State of Play.</p><p dir="ltr">State of Play's typically feature both PlayStation first-party games and third-party partners, so there are tons of games that could potentially appear there. More information about already announced games, like Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> or Housemarque's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/">Saros</a>, the latter of which is slated for 2026, could also get some screen time. Insomniac's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/">Wolverine</a> could also have new information revealed, or another studio could announce an in development game.</p><p>PlayStation has had a rough track record during the PS5 generation when it comes to releasing first-party games. While its single-player output has been slow, the games have been well-received, but its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-admits-its-live-service-games-have-been-rocky-acknowledges-negative-news-about-marathon/1100-6533758/">live-service push has not gone smoothly</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/">Concord getting unreleased and canceled</a>, along with Marathon getting delayed indefinitely, leaving plenty of questions about the console maker's current projects.</p>

                <p>Not all games will land the same in all cultures across the world, and Steam is making a small change to review scores to reflect that. When accessing games with enough scores in your client's selected language, you'll see a separate score for that language alongside other metrics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551543" data-ratio="0.22287390029326" data-width="1023" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551543"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg"></figure><p>Valve published a news post for this change, which says that "when there are enough reviews written in a particular language, Steam will calculate a review score for that language," with review scores displaying based the user's primary language.</p><p>"What this means is that some languages may show more positive review scores, while others may show more negative ones, even for the same game," the post explains.</p><p>With Steam's userbase exploding in places like China, it's not hard to see the utility of this. Things that work in games popular with one culture may not work well in another. Or a game may be written well in its developers' primary language but have a very rough translation--something that won't be relevant to the users who speak that native language.</p><p>This change will take effect for games with more than 2,000 publicly visible reviews, and at least two reviews written in at least one language. The post says Valve "purposely made these thresholds higher than the 10 reviews required to calculate the Overall Review Score" because it wanted to be "pretty confident" in the language-specific score before showing it to other users.</p><p>As shown in the screenshot above, provided by Valve, this isn't meant to take information away from users or manipulate scores. The score still shows the sentiment across all reviews alongside the reviews in your language, as well as all recent reviews, and a deeper language breakdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551545" data-ratio="0.74222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551545"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg"></figure><p>The post says that Valve it knows any changes to review scores will concern users, and states the company has built a variety of features in User Reviews that can be disabled or enabled, should you want to only see the raw review information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm not the most passionate fan of the Mafia series. My history goes something like: loved the first one at the time, was ‘eh’ on the second then bounced off the third despite its novel setting. But I was <em>all in</em> on <em>The Old Country</em> when it was announced. A new Mafia<em> </em>game set in Italy, in the early 1900s (the same fascinating period as the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, caught on the tracks between the 19th century and modernity), and best of all it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/short-smart-potentially-a-gamble-with-mafia-the-old-country-take-two-grapples-with-the-past-and-future-of-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> short</a>? Sign me up.</p><p>I wasn't sent any code for it, and I've been too busy to work on a full review of the game, so I've just been casually playing my way through it over the past couple of weeks. One thing keeping me from <em>rushing</em> were some early reviews;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eurogamer's</a> led with "by-the-numbers design", while<a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kotaku's</a> opens with "Rote, dated gameplay burdens this entry in the Mafia saga".</p><p>Which, whatever, reviews are reviews, I knew exactly what to expect from a Mafia game, and it was never going to be a revolutionary approach to third-person open-world gaming. Harking back to the first two entries in the series, with the added fact it’s trapped within the confines of a prequel, it was never going to be an innovative approach to genre story-telling either. Mafia<em> </em>(third game aside!) is a series born in tribute, an outline traced on butcher's paper over someone else's homage to <em>The Godfather</em>, and you'd be mad to go into this hoping <em>The Old Country</em> was going to be any different.</p><p>It's not even a proper open-world game! Again, like some of its predecessors, this is a fairly guided, level-by-level experience, which while featuring a world that's big and constantly asks you to drive across it, doesn't actually contain any of the trappings of a proper open-world game like exploration and sidequests. Don't think of this as a smaller <em>GTA </em>with nicer suits; think of it as a third-person shooter that just happens to replace loading screens with leisurely drives through the Sicilian countryside.</p><p>Because of my low expectations (complimentary, as we'll get to in a second!), I had a great time with <em>The Old Country</em> because all I ever want from a Mafia<em> </em>game is to kill some time with some run-of-the-mill mob stories (which are often the best kind!) and old-timey cars and work my way through an interactive soap opera interrupted by driving sections instead of commercials, which is exactly what this game delivered.</p><p>The whole thing is just so comfortably on-brand, both as a Mafia<em> </em>game and a mob tale. Its depiction of life in 1900s Sicily ticks every expected box: forbidden love, class warfare, loyalty, corruption and family tensions, with the addition of enough Catholic idolatry crammed into every room and street corner to make the Pope blush. I am not surprised by this but nor am I let down by it; <em>The Old Country</em> sets out to colour by numbers and it colours every one perfectly, right inside the lines.</p><p>I've never once enjoyed driving its lumbering cars or riding its horses, but I've craned my neck to admire the beautiful countryside every chance I've got (this is a <em>very </em>good-looking video game). I dozed off for half the story, but I remember so many snappy lines of dialogue, and everyone's handsome faces, luscious chest hair and wry smiles will live in me long after the credits roll. And a very big and special thanks to everyone who recommended I play the Sicilian dub; it's <em>transformative</em>, and helped set the mood more than any number of paintings of The Blessed Virgin Mary or overly-detailed bottles of olive oil ever could. If you haven't played the game yet, and ever do, playing in its native tongue--<a href="https://www.elalliance.org/languages/sicilian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is distinct from Italian, and extremely cool to see implemented so thoroughly in a video game</a>--is an absolute must.</p><p>The ways <em>The Old Country</em> is so predictable and yet comforting really got me thinking about all the stuff we're missing out on as the AAA games industry collapses into a flaming pile of wreckage. How I have, strangely, gotten to the point in 2025 where I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game.</p><p>As<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> studios close, projects are cancelled and developers laid off in their thousands</a>, we're losing tentpole shooters, licensed action games and multiplayer battle royales, sure, but we're also losing games like <em>this</em>. The kind you may never cosplay for, or put on your GOTY list, but which you were still happy to pay for, enjoyed your time with and left feeling better about at the end. A game that doesn't surprise you or have any tricks up its sleeve, but has enough production money and nice graphics behind it to put a smile on your face on the kind of day when you just want to play a video game, any video game, because video games are great.</p><p>So no, <em>The Old Country</em> is not a breakthrough in third-person action, or historical story-telling. It never needed to be. This is a good book on a rainy afternoon, the latest episode in a dependable, long-running soap opera, a ticket to the 117th <em>Mission Impossible</em> movie. It's fine, and sometimes fine is great.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-closed-weapon-system-better-beta-ea-bf6-2000618282</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fine-i%E2%80%99ll-admit-it-battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-open-weapon-system-is-good.1273284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When I first heard about EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to implement an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">open weapon system in the upcoming<em> Battlefield 6</em></a>, I scoffed! And playing the game in Los Angeles for an event last month didn’t sell me on it, either; I still worried it would make classes feel less unique. Now, after playing the open beta for nearly 20 hours, I’m here to say: I was wrong.</p> <p>Let’s back up for a moment and explain, briefly, open and closed weapon class systems in<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"> <em>Battlefield</em>.</a> (I promise this won’t be too boring.) Basically, for nearly as long as the franchise has been around, classes were locked to certain weapons. Recon, for example, had to use a sniper rifle. Over time, developers at Dice tweaked this and added “neutral” weapons that could be picked by multiple classes, or they spread specific types of weapons across a few classes. <em>Battlefield 2042</em> threw a lot of this out the window when it launched without classes and let players essentially build custom heroes who could use any gadget or gun. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/dev-notes-classes-in-battlefield-2042">It then added classes back in when people got angry</a>. Anyway, <em>Battlefield 6</em> is trying to find a happy balance between <em>2042</em>‘s total, unbalanced openness and the classic closed weapon system of the past games. And I think, despite being nervous about the change and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/open-vs-closed-weapons/12440854?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ0MTg0MSwxMjQ1OTQ5MQ">all the debate raging online among players on both sides</a>, Battlefield Studios has mostly nailed it.</p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> any class can use any weapon. So you can spawn in as a recon soldier, but instead of a sniper rifle, you could bring an SMG. Engineers, traditionally a class that uses SMGs, can rock snipers and LMGs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384#:~:text=This%20is%20extremely,Lots%20of%20destruction">At first, this seemed like a bad idea to me</a>. I worried that players would just pick the class with the best abilities and pick the best assault rifle, and you’d lose all the uniqueness that comes from <em>BF’s</em> old-school class system. And in some smaller, more combat-focused modes, this is indeed the case. But in bigger, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">more <em>Battlefield</em>-y modes, like Conquest and Rush</a>, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how things have worked out.</p>

 <p>In my hours with the beta, I found that in many matches players were spread all around the four classes. In some past games (looking at you, <em>Battlefield 3</em>),&nbsp;people would pick whatever class had the best assault rifle, and that was that. During a Q&amp;A with the devs last month in LA, they talked about this and said that the open weapon system was partly designed to combat this. The idea is that now people will pick classes based on what the team needs and their unique abilities and tools, rather than the weapons they can and can’t use.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s exactly what I saw happening in many <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta matches. If the enemy team, for example, brought in a bunch of vehicles or tanks, I’d see players swap to engineers to use that class’s RPG to take all those machines out. Likewise, I saw players and friends swap to the support class to help hold a point and revive people, or swap to recon to help pin down a target. It seems now that weapons can be freely equipped on any class, people are far more open to playing different classes and helping out the team. Sure, maybe some of these players have just equipped the same assault rifle on all of the classes, but if it helps my team stop a tank from destroying us, I’m fine with it. That’s a much better scenario than in past <em>BF</em> games, where a whole team might be assault soldiers and you’d be unable to get ammo resupplies or fight back against helis.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> also rewards players for choosing a weapon that is more aligned with their class. Recon soldiers get a ton of exclusive sniper perks that make it almost silly to use a sniper rifle on any other class. But you can do it, if that makes you happy. And this is where I’d suggest some tweaks.</p>

 <p>I think rewarding players who pick class-specific weapons is a smart idea, but I almost feel like the devs could do more to make sure picking an assault rifle on every class isn’t an easy option. Perhaps class-specific weapon punishments could work? An assault class soldier picking a sniper rifle might mean they don’t get the recon benefits, and perhaps they also reload the big rifles more slowly. Or an engineer picking an assault rifle has more kick and can’t carry as much ammo for it. These tweaks would reward people playing classes more traditionally, could be overcome with skill or teamwork, and would still allow for the weapon freedom the devs want in <em>BF6</em>.</p> <p>But even if <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs don’t steal my totally-awesome-and-perfect idea, I think the open weapon system is a good change. It lets players enjoy all the classes without forcing them to play with specific guns. This leads to matches in which all the classes are used, and that leads to more enjoyable <em>Battlefield</em> action. And that’s what I’m looking for. Sure, maybe it means that I’ll be killed a lot by a few popular assault rifles, but it might also mean that there will be more medics running around who can heal me. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">That would be nice</a>. And don’t worry; if you hate the open weapon system, EA is going to offer playlists and modes that feature locked weapons, too. Everyone wins.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Beware of what you're about to unleash.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Uh oh, Geoff Keighley is teasing Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Is it...finally time? Dare we hope?</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If that above post means nothing to you, you've managed to steer clear of the Hollow Knight: Silksong fervor for years now, somehow. Since 2021, Hollow Knight fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">used images and emojis of clowns</a> (and specifically, the one right below) to goof about their constant hope for news about Silksong, especially around big presentations like Nintendo Directs, The Game Awards, or Summer Game Fest. Every time a new presentation rolled around, Silksong fans would post clown images and joke about putting on clown makeup, effectively acknowledging that it was cartoonish to hope for Silksong news but that they were hoping anyway.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/234-1755542983064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Keighley could just be posting himself in a clown outfit for the heck of it, but I can't imagine that would be advisable given the fervor of the Silksong audience. Earlier this year, fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">went nuts over a chocolate cake recipe</a>, in a move which went so far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake">force the developers to make a statement</a>, so teasing that audience probably isn't the best idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Keighley's tease seems like a pretty sure thing. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong is coming out in 2025 barring any unexpected delays</a>, and there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">demo of the game playable on the show floor</a> of Gamescom this week. We also know, via a leak, that the ROG Xbox Ally will launch on October 16, and Xbox's Sarah Bond has previously stated that Silksong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retail-leak-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date">would be on the system when it launched</a>. If everyone's telling the truth and there have been no last-minute changes, that means Silksong should be out in the next two months sometime. And that would also mean we're due for an actual, real, confirmed release date any second now. Who's got a big showcase going on where such an announcement would make a huge splash? Keighley, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there's always a chance that we're all just putting on our clown makeup today only to be disappointed once again tomorrow. Grab a slice of chocolate cake, stick on that rubber nose, and let's lock in for Opening Night Live tomorrow.

N’s Reshiram – 167/159 (Illustration Rare)</h2><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226586"><div id="226586" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Reshiram - 167/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite modest power on the battlefield, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4lmo?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Reshiram</a> is a stunner visually. The dreamy art style sets it apart, with pastel tones that blend N’s iconic soft-spoken nature with Reshiram’s divine presence — almost making it look like the cover of a fairy tale. Its main value stems from character appeal, not competitive strength — but it’s already seeing a slow rise in demand from collectors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Iono’s Bellibolt ex – 188/159 (Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226585"><div id="226585" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Iono's Bellibolt ex - 188/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This golden Hyper Rare is more than eye candy, since the Electric Streamer ability of <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK6WY?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iono’s Bellibolt ex</a> provides reliable Lightning energy acceleration, making it useful in niche Electric decks. While not a meta staple, Iono’s popularity continues to push her cards into collectors’ crosshairs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. N’s Zoroark ex – 189/159 (Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226584"><div id="226584" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Zoroark ex - 189/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">N returns once again with a sleek <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1VmR?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zoroark</a>. Like its Special Illustration Rare counterpart, this card has Trade, one of the strongest card draw abilities in the game. With its golden finish and historical relevance to classic Zoroark GX decks, this is a solid budget-friendly option for players and collectors alike.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Articuno – 161/159 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226583"><div id="226583" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Articuno - 161/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03dbp?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Articuno</a> brings a stunning frozen aesthetic to match its sharp blue colouring, blending a simultaneous sense of camouflage and elegance. As for gameplay, Frigid Fluttering offers decent early-game acceleration in Water decks, but it’s the artwork that carries the value here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of the original legendary bird trio, this is a must-have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Volcanion ex – 182/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226582"><div id="226582" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Volcanion ex - 182/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Akagi behind the brush to bring back their striking art style, it’s no surprise this card is climbing in value.

Hop’s Zacian ex – 186/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226581"><div id="226581" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hop's Zacian ex - 186/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zacian continues its streak as a playable and collectable legend. This version, partnered with Hop, features a charming and relaxing forest scene, which comes off as an interesting tonal shift from previous Zacian cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Oqp7?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hop's Zacian ex</a> is still testing its footing competitively, as well, but fans of Galar’s rivals with the cash to spare will likely scoop this one up based on narrative and nostalgia alone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. N’s Zoroark ex – 185/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226580"><div id="226580" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Zoroark ex - 185/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its Hyper Rare equivalent, this SIR version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAdLD?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Zoroark ex</a> is one of the most competitively viable cards in the set. Trade is still an exceptional ability, but its slick artwork doubles the appeal, with N and Zoroark standing ominously under a moody spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, with this one’s much higher value, we’d recommend keeping this version of N’s Zoroark in your folder if you have one of the cheaper versions for your deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Iono’s Bellibolt ex – 183/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226579"><div id="226579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Iono's Bellibolt ex - 183/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As with many Iono cards, demand is high across the board, and this delightful SIR Bellibolt card offers the same Electric Streamer utility as its Hyper Rare with a highly animated, stylised background, and adorable close-up featuring the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-scarlet"><u>Scarlet</u></a> &amp; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-violet"><u>Violet</u></a> gym leader and her partner Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not dominating tournaments, the sheer popularity of Iono’s character continues to make this <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GgjE?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iono's Bellibolt ex</a> card one of the most sought-after from the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Salamence ex – 187/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226578"><div id="226578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Salamence ex - 187/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObm4O?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Salamence ex</a> card captures everything fans love about the pseudo-legendary with its big power, bold colours, and imposing presence. It’s not the most practical card in the meta due to its high energy costs, but its nostalgic pull and sweeping museum-grade artwork have given it a big lift in value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Lillie’s Clefairy ex – 184/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226577"><div id="226577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Journey Together set’s crown jewel in price is, unsurprisingly, a Lillie card with a $125+ value at the time of writing.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-vp-hints-at-%E2%80%9Cmore-affordable%E2%80%9D-xbox-cloud-gaming-service.1273254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscribers know that they have the ability to stream their games through Xbox Cloud Gaming, if they're ever inclined to stream whatever they want to play rather than play it natively on their preferred device. Currently, that option is only available to players who are paying for that top-tier subscription for Xbox Game Pass, but Microsoft's vice president of next generation, Jason Ronald, seems to have hinted that a "<em>more affordable</em>" plan for Xbox Cloud Gaming could be on the way.</p>



<p>During the official Xbox podcast, Ronald and Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox, discussed a variety of topics, including the Cloud Gaming service, and what could be on the horizon for Microsoft's investment in cloud gaming.</p>



<p>"<em>Our goal is really simple. We want to bring more games to more people. Cloud gaming is great at that</em>," said Beaumont. He continued to say that achieving that goal would include expanding the service to more countries around the world, and to as many devices as Xbox can.</p>



<p>Ronald, for his part, added "<em>One of the things we see is there's a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that's the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go. And so for us, I think it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable and to make it more accessible to more players, whether that's going into new regions or new ways to actually access the cloud."</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ronald stops there, and doesn't go further to say that Microsoft and Xbox are prepared to launch a new tier for Game Pass that's just focused on Cloud Gaming, but that's the obvious way you'd think Microsoft would make its cloud gaming service more affordable, by making a tier that is exclusively streaming-focused, and isn't tied to the rest of the features you get from Game Pass, like being able to download every title natively to your device.</p>



<p>We'll see if that's a path Microsoft ends up choosing. In the meantime, the company is preparing to debut its <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> device at Gamescom 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We are still firmly in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690#content">“Gimmick Popcorn Bucket Era” of movie theaters</a>, and it shows no signs of stopping. Usually, these gimmicky popcorn buckets are items that fans want to buy and collect. But it seems like not many people want the creepy bucket for <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em>, featuring iconic haunted doll Annabelle. I wonder why.</p> <p>On August 18, Regal Cinema shared a photo of its popcorn bucket for the upcoming horror film, <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> the ninth (?!) film in the wildly popular <em>Conjuring</em> series. The movie is being marketed as a sort of ending for this era of the spooky franchise, though it sounds like more <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-best-horror-movies-1851282873/5"><em>Conjuring</em> universe</a> movies will happen in the future. Anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/FSAz556s0fM">as seen in <em>Last Rites’</em> new trailer</a>, the franchise’s famous haunted doll, Annabelle, is returning for the <em>Conjuring’s</em> finale. And to celebrate, Regal’s new popcorn bucket features the doll herself, connected to a faux-wooden bucket with the movie’s logo slapped on it. The bucket will be available to order on Wednesday, over two weeks before the movie’s release.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">She's been released once more… Annabelle popcorn buckets coming to Regal this Wednesday.🍿 <a href="https://t.co/9cPobQ1Nkt">pic.twitter.com/9cPobQ1Nkt</a></p> <p>— Regal (@RegalMovies) <a href="https://twitter.com/RegalMovies/status/1957476386852979164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In the <em>Conjuring</em> universe, where she has three of her own spin-off movies as well as appearances in the main series, Annabelle is portrayed as scary, dangerous, evil, and just generally not a good doll you want to take home. I wasn’t surprised, then, that a lot of fans online don’t want this cursed piece of plastic in their homes.</p>

 <p>“Oh hell no lol,” said one user. “Um, that’s one bucket I don’t want,” said another person. Someone else replied: “Y’all can keep that one.”</p> <p>“Am I supposed to take this home?” asked someone in a reply to <em>DiscussingFilm</em>‘s tweet about the doll bucket. A diffferent user replied to the same tweet with: “<span>Nah nah nah nah you’re not gonna get me Annabelle, nice try.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haunt your popcorn with our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheConjuring?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheConjuring</a>: Last Rites Annabelle popcorn bucket available starting August 22! <a href="https://t.co/UiYfek3Nft">pic.twitter.com/UiYfek3Nft</a></p> <p>— Cinemark Theatres (@Cinemark) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cinemark/status/1957534818465726527?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Meanwhile, on Monday, Cinemark shared a first look at its own <em>Conjuring 4</em> popcorn bucket and uh, well, reactions were different. That’s mainly because Cinemark’s gimmick bucket featuring Annabelle makes you eat the popcorn out of her ass. Would Tom Cruise eat popcorn out of Annabelle’s ass? Probably, the dude loves popcorn. But others aren’t as interested. This bucket will be available on Friday, August 22.</p> <p><em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> alongside all the fake Annabelle popcorn buckets you desire (or fear), arrives in theaters on September 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s very easy to not do something. You can simply say no, even and perhaps especially when an arm of the Esports World Cup, <a href="https://aftermath.site/saudi-arabia-scopely-pokemon-go-street-fighter-esports-human-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a vehicle for Saudi government sportswashing</a>, comes to you and asks you to speak at a conference that organizers clearly hope will confer mainstream credibility, because esports is a niche field even at max audience capacity. Anyway, a bunch of video game industry luminaries, including Hideo Kojima, said yes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://newglobalsportconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Global Sport Conference</a>, which also took place alongside the Esports World Cup in 2023 and 2024, is being billed as “the premier global platform for industry leaders at the intersection of gaming, esports and sport” where CEOs, founders, and investors “drive groundbreaking initiatives shaping the future of these dynamic industries.” In other words, it’s a networking event for rich people – some of whom might be harder up for cash than usual, relatively speaking, due to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the current state of the video game industry</a>.</p><p>“NGSC plays a vital role in advancing Saudi Arabia's 2030 vision, aligning with our National Gaming and Esports Strategy to position Riyadh as the global capital of esports and a hub for innovation, talent, and opportunity,” Saudi esports federation president Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan al Saud says in a blurb on NGSC's website.</p><p>Previous years’ iterations <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2023/10/new-global-sport-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2024/08/speakers-announced-for-2024-new-global-sport-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a> bigwigs from companies like Sony, Sega, and Bungie, as well as a bunch of esports types and investors, but Kojima is easily NGSC’s biggest get in terms of pure name value. This year he’s joined by the likes of Activision COO Joshua Taub, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Sega president Shuji Utsumi, Sony CSO Toshimoto Mitomo, <em>Tekken </em>director Katsuhiro Harada, former gaming exec and current soccer team owner Peter Moore, and chess champion Magnus Carlsen, among others. I hope they all have a great time this weekend.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/11/saudi-arabia-executions-surge-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report from Human Rights Watch and Middle East Democracy Center</a> says that 2025 has seen Saudi authorities carry out an “unprecedented surge in executions,” notable among them Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.</p><p>“Behind closed doors, Saudi Arabia is executing peaceful activists and journalists following politicized trials,” said Middle East Democracy Center’s Abdullah Alaoudh. “These state-sanctioned killings are an assault on basic human rights and dignity that the world cannot afford to ignore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics"><h3>Despite What NYT, WaPo, And Vanity Fair Seem To Think, We Still Need Critics</h3></a><p>"You’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Everyone is waiting for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to come out. It’s the most wishlisted game on Steam. You can’t watch <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219">a new gaming showcase these days</a> without the chat being flooded with stuff like “Show<em> Silksong</em>? Where is <em>Silksong</em>? <em>Silksong</em> when?” Due out before the end of 2025, time is running out for a release date announcement or even a same-day shadow-drop. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">With Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a> just around the corner, could this finally be the moment of truth? Host Geoff Keighley is certainly acting like it.</p> <p>Gaming’s veteran hype man has been sharing images of Gamescom ONL prep, including one of him in front of a mirror wearing a clown nose. It’s a clear wink to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup"><em>Silksong</em> fanart clown makeup meme</a> about perpetual disappointment. The trend started years ago when developer Team Cherry was MIA, but hit a new fever pitch after Xbox claimed <em>Silksong</em> would arrive in 2022, only for it to never come out. Many gaming showcases have come and gone since, with the Metroidvanaia Soulslike only ever appearing briefly as part of a sizzle reel here and there.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First time? 🤡 </p> <p>See you tomorrow for <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> ONL. <a href="https://t.co/59ef5sFysJ">pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJ</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Keighley is either tipping his hand that big <em>Silksong</em> news is just around the corner or paving the way for the biggest collective letdown ever. Since the game will be playable at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mjunk6/silksong_confirmed_to_be_playable_at_the_nintendo/">multiple booths</a> on the Gamescom show floor, my money’s on the former. It’s coming to Switch but has also been promised to be available day-one on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld, rumored to release in October. Plus, the soundtrack was j<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mtoufc/silksongs_ost_has_been_added_to_gog_though/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">ust added to the backend of GOG</a>.</p>

  <p>Keighley’s showcase will take place on August 19, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. It will run approximately two hours with a pre-show that starts at 1:30 p.m. ET. You can stream it live on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVC_dBNUZGc">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI">Twitch</a>. The event tends to have new game announcements sprinkled in with trailers and updates on already revealed games coming out in the next few months, plus occasionally brief intros from the developers themselves. This year’s Gamescom ONL will also include a live orchestra performance of music from surprise hit <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and the first footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233">of <em>Fallout</em> season 2</a>.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVC_dBNUZGc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>What games will be shown at Gamescom ONL?</h2> <p>Beyond the tease for <em>Silksong</em>, Keighley has already confirmed the following nine games will also make an appearance:</p> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></li> <li><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></li> <li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></li> <li><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></li> </ul> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> is expected to reveal the first footage from its updated multiplayer, while<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-ps5-exclusivity-date-sale-1851783817"><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> is headed to Xbox this week and could potentially be showing off its long-rumored DLC expansion. With no BlizzCon this year, Microsoft will also be using ONL to debut the next <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion, though a much bigger deal would be if it ever gets a much-requested console port. And what about <em>Diablo 4</em>‘s recently leaked Paladin subclass, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1mq4i45/the_d4_vendor_builds_were_updated_and_it_looks/">rumored</a> to be part of its next expansion? <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Microsoft’s other big fall release, but with few updates on its biggest in-development games at its Xbox showcase in June, there are plenty of other big releases that could make surprise appearances at ONL.</p> <p>We haven’t heard much from Ubisoft this year either. Amid big delays and internal restructurings, the French publisher declined to hold its usual Summer Game Fest-adjacent June showcase. With the next <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em> remakes all in development, any one of them could get a tease at Gamescom. The developers behind <em>The Division 2</em> have already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1mtq98p/the_division_2s_gamescom_schedule_this_week/">teased</a> news on the ongoing loot shooter’s big winter update. Who knows, maybe Gamescom 2025 is when <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> will finally resurface</a>!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/iconic-interactive-debut-game-the-oversight-bureau-nvidia-ace-ai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/iconic-interactive-announces-debut-game-the-oversight-bureau-coming-to-pc-in-2025-and-enhanced-by-nvidia%E2%80%99s-ace-ai-tech.1273206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuJFzmVmm-c">NVIDIA GeForce ON Community Update</a>, developer Iconic Interactive revealed its debut title, <a href="https://theoversightbureau.com/">The Oversight Bureau</a>, a puzzle game that lets players use their voice to progress through the narrative that's enhanced by NVIDIA's ACE AI technology.</p>



<p>The studio calls it an "<em>Orwellian puzzle game</em>" in a press release, with its setting being that you're stuck in something called the CUTE Reprogramming Centre, and won't be released until you're deemed "<em>a more appropiate, more compliant member of society</em>."</p>



<p>If you're wondering how you use your voice to play the game, Iconic Interactive uses its proprietary Narrative Engine and NVIDIA's AI technology ACE to create the gameplay experience where you talk to a character in the game to solve the puzzle.</p>



<p>Regarding its proprietary engine, Iconic Interactive breaks it down "<em>into two parts: one AI model analyzes and understands a player's sentiment, while the other delivers dialogue, behavior and theatrical performance relevant to the character, story, and situation</em>. <em>The innovative approach enabled developers to maintain control of the story while providing players with an unparalleled experience, fully immersing them in the narrative</em>."</p>



<p>Iconic Interactive <a href="https://www.iconicgames.io/#about">calls itself a studio that is embracing AI</a> "<em>to enhance creativity, not replace it.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GeForce On Community Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuJFzmVmm-c?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We're thrilled to be able to show the work we have put into creating a new experience for players and utilizing the advanced tech of the Narrative Engine</em>," said chief executive officer and founder of Iconic Interactive, Junaid Hussain. </p>



<p>"<em>The Oversight Bureau is unlike any other gaming experience, and we cannot wait to bring this to PC screens and allow players to experience the use of AI in a creative and new way. Thank you to NVIDIA for allowing us to showcase our debut title. The team has worked hard on this, and we cannot wait to see its reception at the showcase</em>."</p>



<p>The short clip of gameplay we see in the presentation is interesting, to say the least, but it's not yet clear if The Oversight Bureau works as a full game or if it falls apart beyond what we see in the tech demo shown here. We'll see how the full release fares when it launches on PC this year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2/" data-ref-id="5000-128269">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> has been only available on PC and Mac since its release in 2013, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/american-truck-simulator/" data-ref-id="5000-260007">American Truck Simulator</a> has been parked on the same platforms since 2016. Euro Truck Simulator 2 has remained popular on Steam in that time despite its age. Now, both games are heading to to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>PlayStation Network has listed pages for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009049" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008808" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Truck Simulator</a>, while Xbox added <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/euro-truck-simulator-2/9nlvc6stps52" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the former</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/american-truck-simulator/9nwwkck9kd5f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latter</a> shortly thereafter. Specific release dates have yet to be disclosed.</p><p>Just as the name suggests, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is set in several countries across Europe as players assume the role of a cargo truck driver. As part of the game, players have to manage the costs of each trip while saving money to expand their business, purchase a better truck and even hire additional AI drivers to put a trucking fleet together.</p><p>As the more recent game of the two, American Truck Simulator has a more refined presentation while giving players the option to deliver cargo across iconic locations in the country. The game also has enhanced customization features for players' trucks and trailers, as well as different types of brakes that can be used in the game.</p><p>In 2023, SCS Software accepted ads from real trucking companies that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-trucking-company-is-buying-billboards-in-american-truck-simulator-to-help-recruit-staff/1100-6515039/" data-ref-id="1100-6515039">placed recruitment billboards in American Truck Simulator</a>. Perhaps some of those ads will carry over to the new console ports as well. SCS has also teased that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/227300/view/501707621168840988?snr=1_5_9_" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more news may arrive at Gamescom</a> later this week.</p>
