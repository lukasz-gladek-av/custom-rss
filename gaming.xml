		<p>BW Labs has revealed Fold &amp; Fly, a paper plane experience that is not quite what you’re used to. The game of Fold &amp; Fly has you pilot a paper plane through different worlds in the pursuit of getting high scores by collecting stars, and opening portals to other worlds by getting the dragonflies that are spread around those worlds. You can check out the gameplay in the reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fold &amp; Fly Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jh6Byv1pKE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fold &amp; Fly will have procedurally generated levels, which means you are unlikely to have the same layouts to fly through during each play session. Additionally, the game will map generator using seed inputs, allowing players to create and save new maps to play through as well. The worlds do feature dynamic weather systems including fog and storms to up the challenge of piloting around the hazards in front of you. The full features listed by BW Labs include:</p>
<p>✦ Intuitive, smooth flying gameplay with paper plane physics<br>
✦ Infinite procedurally generated worlds to explore<br>
✦ Score-chasing action: collect stars and chain near-misses<br>
✦ Glowing origami dragonflies that summon portals to new worlds<br>
✦ A whimsical, handcrafted art style<br>
✦ Easy to pick up, satisfying to master<br>
✦ Great for quick sessions or long flow-state flights</p>
<p>Fold &amp; Fly is going to be released on July 25th for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812280/Fold__Fly/">Steam</a>, and you can wishlist it now. If you are going to get it the PC specs you need to be aware of are as follows. There has not been any confirmation of Steam Deck compatibility.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Santa Monica has been working on *something* following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and co-creator of the God of War series and lead on the 2018 reboot of the series, Cory Barlog, has been leading a new project at the studio for some time. But we're still very short on any details regarding what's next for the studio.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been pretty mute on the subject of Sony Santa Monica's new game, but we do seem to have a small update on how things are going. In a thread on ResetEra, Bloomberg reporter and video game industry insider Jason Schreier responded to a question regarding SSM's next game and Cory Barlog's new project. </p>



<p>"<em>Cory Barlog's game is SSM's next big thing</em>," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-394#post-142651128">Schreier responded</a>. "<em>Last time I spoke to anyone about it (a month or two ago) it was going well.</em>" That doesn't tell us very much at all, but at least its a sign that things are in a good place at Sony Santa Monica regarding Barlog and his team's new game.</p>



<p>Schreier's next comment, however, is what made players raise their eyebrows as to whatever this next game is. The prevailing rumor about SSM's next big game <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/">has been that it is a brand new IP</a>, a big deal for a studio that has only made God of War games for its entire existence. After his comments on how things are going started to make the rounds on social media, and players expressed their excitement for a new IP from SSM,<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-396#post-142655865"> Schreier followed up by asking</a>, "<em>Why does everybody think Barlog's game is a new IP?</em>"</p>



<p>Just asking the question doesn't insinuate one way or the other about Sony Santa Monica's next game being a new IP. But it does leave some doubt regarding previous rumors about Barlog's next project being the studio's first deviation from the God of War series. Ultimately, we'll have to wait and see what Sony Santa Monica and Barlog's team has been cooking, though who knows when PlayStation will be ready to talk about it. </p>



<p>The other major rumor circulating the God of War studio is that there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War</a> game coming. That project, supposedly, could be announced any day now, as it was claimed earlier this year that it was due to be revealed. </p>

            <p>You might remember Where Winds Meet as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a> Wuxia <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that mixes scenes of exquisite calligraphy with scenes of hooligan sword masters subjecting blameless bears to sonic bombardment, paralysing whole gangs of chimney sweeps with chained Blink attacks, and getting chased by angry geese.</p>
<p>If you don't, you can watch the below trailer or read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wildly-ambitious-rpg-that-lets-you-yeet-bears">preview from 2023</a>, in which he commented "I'm both excited to see more and a tad worried it could end up being a disjointed, overstretched mash". Then you can consider signing up to the game's next playtest, which runs from July 25th to July 30th.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest introduces the city of Kaifeng, "with over one million square meters to discover", plus "10,000 NPCs" to befriend, pickpocket, punch (perhaps because they've witnessed you pickpocketing) and bother for quests. I'm not clear on whether this means 10,000 individually modelled NPCs, or 10,000 NPCs on screen, or just 10,000 NPCs in total. The figure seems meaningless without context. I should probably delete that line. Ah, but then I'd have to rewrite all this. Argh, let's keep going. </p>
<p>Expect "sharp contrasts - from the luxury of Fanlou Golden Street to struggling slums, from grand palaces to the mysterious ghost market". Also, "a range of classic Chinese activities", including bathhouse visits and traditional opera. The city will change in response to your actions: "abandoned wheat fields may flourish again, and rundown streets can become lively neighborhoods". Sounds like a lot of Video Game, but I'm mostly here to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p7Esu6l_9M">mess people up with a brolly</a>. </p>
<p>The developers are Everstone Studio, and the publishers are NetEase, who've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-publishers-reveal-blood-message-a-naughty-dog-style-singleplayer-action-game-set-in-tang-era-china">making waves recently with their bigger-budget productions</a> and also, with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">rumoured layoff plans</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">After a surprise unveiling during the Xbox Showcase last month, Invincible VS--a 3v3 fighting game from Skybound and Quarter Up, a new studio made up of multiple fighting game veteran devs--hadn't seen any new information come to light. Today, that drought ended with an explosion, as the abrasive Guardian of the Globe known as Rex Splode officially joins the playable roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Rex Splode's intro trailer shows off a few of his main combos and special moves, which utilize his ability to make anything he touches explode with kinetic energy. He's seen throwing exploding projectiles, turning himself into an explosive ball for multiple hits, and shoving two exploding sticks into an opponent's body before sending them off with a "polite" message.</p>

If you're eager to know what's new in EA Sports FC 26, your day is almost here; EA is giving its latest football iteration the full reveal treatment later this week. And it's also unveiled this year's Ultimate Edition cover star, so you got something to look at while you wait.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, EA Sports FC 26's "full reveal" is scheduled to air this Wednesday, 16th July. Proceedings get underway at 5pm BST, so you've got approximately 47 hours at the time of writing to dig out your best hat in anticipation.  And when you're done, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24">bookmark the appropriate YouTube page</a>.
</p>
<p>
EA's reveal announcement arrives alongside a <em>second</em> announcement <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSFC/status/1944774028578684977">confirming</a> one of this year's EA Sports FC cover stars: retired Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović is EA Sports FC 26's Ultimate Edition cover star, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zlatan-ibrahimovi-accuses-ea-of-using-his-name-and-face-in-fifa-21-without-permission-ea-responds">falling out with the company</a> back in 2020 when he accused it of using his name and face without any agreement in the FIFA games.

There's no official release date for EA Sports FC 26 yet (previous leaks have suggested EA is eyeing up a 26th September launch, however), but expect it to be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC when it eventually shows up.

            <p>
I'm writing up Astro Prospector for a couple of reasons: firstly, it reminds me of two childhood favourites, Atari's Asteroids and the less-known Crystal Quest for the Macintosh. And secondly, there's something appealingly perverse about a <em>bullet hell</em> of all gametypes that is always simulating the player nodding off at the keyboard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's an "incremental" single-screen shmup and office burnout spoof in which you control a spaceship with the mouse, auto-mining asteroids for giant coffee beans, while avoiding or destroying the forces of the villainous SpaceCorp.</p>
<p>The length of each round depends on your pilot's starting caffeine intake: after a few seconds, their eyelids will droop shut and obscure the view. But you can grind your beans between missions to unlock buffs that empower your ship and prolong your wakefulness. One of the unlocks lets you fly through hoops that generate Flow, the productivity guru's favourite tipple.
</p>
<p>
The first SpaceCorp enemies consist of lethargic fidget-spinners - easily flummoxed by orbiting slowly around them. Later enemies deliver the expected screenfuls of projectiles, obliging you to follow very particular paths across the screen while continuing to excavate the swirling spacerocks.</p>
<p>As frenetic as the battles get, though, it seems you'll always have to worry about your pilot falling asleep. To sleep: perchance to dream of upgrade screens. And then, back to the gauzy brown starfields for a top-up. Such madness. So sadness. Nice pixel HUD and ship designs, though. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Find the demo on Steam</a>.

That means not just validating what came before, but recontextualizing it and evolving and changing as the story moves forward.”</p><p>“I didn’t feel resentful in some way,” continued Johnson. “But you’re talking about a movie made by my friends, with my friends in it. I sit down to watch a movie, and it’s a <em>Star Wars</em> movie. It’s all stuff I love. I’m not the one to come to for a hard-hitting critique. You can go to YouTube for that.”</p><p>Johnson also made it clear that he didn’t intend to retcon any moments from 2015's <em>The Force Awakens,</em> directed by J.J. Abrams as well.<em>&nbsp;</em>In fact, they communicated during the production of <em>Force Awakens. </em></p><p>“We communicated. We met and I spent days with him and was able to get into his head and all the choices he had made,” said Johnson. “That having been said, I communicated and I went and made the movie. And he was in the middle of <em>Force Awakens</em>.”</p><p>Ultimately, I feel like the choices in [<em>The Last Jedi</em>], none of them were born out of an intent to ‘undo’ anything. They were all born out of the opposite intent of, how do I take this story that J.J. wrote, that I really loved, and these characters he created that I really loved, and take them to the next step? Kathy [Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm] said, ‘We’re looking at someone to do the <em>Empire </em>[<em>Strikes Back</em>] of this series.’ I took that assignment very seriously. Maybe more seriously than someone would have liked. I guess to me that didn’t mean making something that just had nods to <em>Empire</em> — that meant trying to genuinely do what <em>Empire </em>did.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-last-jedi-director-rian-episode-9-jj-retcon-1851786221]]></content:encoded>

This set is shaping up to be a big one, bringing back classic mechanics with modern flair, and preorders tend to sell out quickly once word gets out. This also means that other big box retailers should be going live with their preorder allocations soon, so make sure to keep an eye on Target and Walmart below.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the Mega Evolutions preorders, today’s lineup has a few other bangin deals. Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered is down to $48.31 for the Day One Edition on Nintendo Switch, and The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition hardcover is sitting at just over $30. If you’ve been eyeing AirPods Pro 2, they’re holding steady at $199, offering great value with active noise cancellation and personalized spatial audio. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is it, the beggining of a new expansion for Pokémon TCG. Best Buy have gone live with their preorder allocation for Mega Evolutions today, which mean Target and Walmart won't be far behind. Here's all the links you need and good luck trainers!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I'm writing this, but Amazon has quite a bit of sealed Pokémon TCG product for under market value. Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-swi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yu-Gi-Oh!

Early Days Collection (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up the Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection for Switch and it’s been a solid throwback to the old Duel Monsters days. I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great. The save-anywhere feature makes it easy to squeeze in a match during a break and come back to it later. I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover. At $30.07 it is a big drop from the usual $90 which makes it a sound deal. What really sets this edition apart are the illustrations with Tolkien’s own drawings maps and sketches included throughout. The full text is printed in red and black ink and there are details like sprayed edges and a ribbon bookmark that make it feel more like a collector’s item.</p></div><p id="suikoden-i-ii-hd-remastered-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switc">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225250"><div id="225250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered at $48.31 for the Day One Edition is an essential pickup for JRPG fans.

Fattle fast forward and auto-save features make revisiting these games more modern and easier to play in shorter sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-exclusive-hands-on-preview-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-%E2%80%93-exclusive-hands-on-preview-ign-first.1243227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I sat down to play about three hours of Mafia: The Old Country, Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes repeatedly mentioned his team’s desire for players to finish this prequel’s story. And so with that goal in mind, the latest Mafia game turns back the clock both chronologically – it’s set in the early 1900s in Sicily – and in game design as well. Mafia 3, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/mafia-3-review"><u>very good</u></a>, went full open-world, and the developers seemed to feel similarly about it in hindsight as players did: it just didn’t fit Mafia well. The first two Mafias were gorgeous, narrative-driven, linear games set against the backdrop of a stunning and highly detailed world that, while explorable, really only existed as a beautiful backdrop for your main mission, rather than trying to keep you busy with menial tasks and sidequests. In fact, Baynes seemed to suggest that the positive reception to 2020’s remake of the first game (Mafia: Definitive Edition) served as something of an inspiration to and north star for this fourth entry in the mainline series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m pleased to report that after playing through Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of The Old Country, the development team has seemingly succeeded in returning Mafia to its gameplay roots. This is, like Mafia 1 and 2, a story-first, not-open-world action-adventure. And interestingly, your primary, upgradeable weapon isn’t a gun – though they are certainly here – but rather, your knife. Stealth is fully supported, and even better, it’s only going to be $50 at launch, or as I like to call it, the Reverse Randy Pitchford price tag.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">That Old Familiar Feeling</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first picked up the controller – playing on a high-end PC, which is where the footage you’re seeing in the video at the top of this page and directly above came from – it’s the early 1900s and late-teenager Enzo Favara has recently escaped the sulfur mines he spent his childhood laboring in and started to become his own free man while working in the vineyard of Don Torrisi, a Sicilian mafioso who protects the people and property of the region from the thieving bandits that lurk in the hills – in exchange for monthly protection payments, of course. I really like how The Old Country tries to depict Enzo’s progression from a very innocent kid into a bound-by-blood, fully vetted member of the Torrisi outfit who’s got the green light to do anything he thinks needs to be done for the good of the family. We see this play out in Chapter 3, where Enzo’s first taste of life outside the vineyard with the Torrisis comes when he’s brought along on a series of collections by Luca, the Don’s right hand man, and Cesare, another made member of the family.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Luca and Cesare are essentially the mafioso version of an angel and devil on your shoulders.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Luca and Cesare are essentially the mafioso version of an angel and devil on your shoulders, where Luca preaches patience and using violence only as a last resort, while Cesare is more of a “shoot first and ask questions later” kind of guy. For example, on our first collection stop, we visited Marco, an olive farmer. Marco always pays on time, but on this occasion, he’s late. Luca gives me an unloaded gun to be used only as an intimidation tactic to get Marco to pay up, but Cesare told me, “An extra pair of hands helps jog their memory” about the late payment. Side note: I think I saw more fruit in three hours of playing Mafia: The Old Country than I’ve seen in any game ever. We might need a new Game Awards category for this. Ultimately, no bullets were fired nor punches thrown, and I got the Don’s money from Marco’s safe after finding the combination nearby. I appreciate that Hangar 13 put thought into Enzo’s journey into the Torrisi crime family here and didn’t just instantly let you become a murdering psychopath.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Things escalated slightly on our second stop, though, after we rode our horses across the Sicilian countryside to the farm of Mr. Bangalino, whose workers, led by a man named Manuele, are on strike. “We can't have strikes around here, Manuele,” Luca told the not-working men. “You and your friends need to get back to work. This is bad for business.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the way, I can’t emphasize enough how much I enjoyed staring at the countryside while riding to each destination on this mission. Mafia: The Old Country ditches the proprietary engine it’s used in all three previous Mafia games and moves to Unreal Engine 5 for this installment. To be fair, the previous engine was no slouch; Mafia 2 in particular was a strikingly good-looking game at the time it came out, and Unreal maintains the series’ reputation for delivering lovely locations. The perfect blue skybox and pillowy clouds that set atop the rolling green hills and farmlands did a great job of establishing The Old Country’s Sicilian setting. I can’t wait to see more of this world in the rest of the campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, Manuele pulled a knife, introducing me to what is, as I mentioned earlier, perhaps the weapon that Mafia: The Old Country puts the most importance on. You can unlock and earn new knives, and each has unique modifying properties, giving you a reason beyond the cosmetic appearance of each blade to choose a specific one that suits your combat preferences. You’ve got a lot of moves in a knife fight: thrusts, slashes, parries, and dodges (like in the Batman: Arkham games, heavy attacks can’t be parried and must instead be dodged). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there was still one final collection errand to run in Chapter 3, and as you may have guessed by now, the cannoli hit the fan on this one. A visit to a farmer named Fichera sees him yell at us, in a reversal, because his new water pump was stolen by bandits and the protection he pays Don Torrisi handsomely for didn’t protect his valuable property. It’s finally here that the patient Luca tells Enzo that he’s got free reign to put live ammo in his gun and not be afraid to pull the trigger, as these lawless bandits were effectively putting their hands in the Don’s pocket by stealing from Fichera. This leads to a hunt up the hillside through two separate bandit camps before we finally squared off with – and shot many bullets into – the dozen or so wayward thieves that stood between us and the water pump they stole. The familiar third-person cover-based shooting gameplay will be instantly recognizable not just to Mafia series regulars but also anyone who’s played a good third-person action game in the past decade. The Old Country isn’t breaking the mold here, but the gameplay systems are comfortable, effective, and fun. Less comfortable – at least for me – was the cutscene that followed the death of the last of the bandits, when Cesare cuts off the finger of one of the bandits, takes his gold ring as a bonus payment for his troubles, and tosses the detached digit into the well. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Forbidden Love</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With all of your onboarding completed in Chapter 3, the next section of Mafia: The Old Country saw one massive mission play out, involving the Don’s daughter Isabella, who Enzo clearly has reciprocated feelings for, and Gennaro, the son of Baron Fontanella, who’s arguably an even bigger fish in the Sicilian mafioso sea than Don Torrisi is. Gennaro wants to show off his fancy new car – and he also wants to woo Isabella – so he sets up a picnic date in the nearby ruins. It starts with Enzo having to babysit the gathering and ends with a kidnapping, a car chase involving you on a horse, a trail of bodies left in Enzo’s wake, a stabbed double-crossing business partner, a happy Don Torrisi, and an even-more-smitten-with-Enzo Isabella. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It started quietly, with Gennaro driving Cesare in his car to the ruins, and Isabella insisting on riding there on horseback alongside Enzo. Yes, you’ll be able to choose and ride your own horse in Mafia: The Old Country, with each steed even having its own personality and characteristics. Based on what I played, it didn’t necessarily seem like your choice of horse would materially affect gameplay, but it was a welcome way to add a bit of life and meaning to the narrative nevertheless. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A pit stop en route showed off the camera you can take pictures of scenic spots with; unfortunately it was the only opportunity I had to use it in the three hours I played, but hopefully you get to use it semi-regularly over the course of the campaign. You’re also introduced to the driving mechanics of The Old Country after you rendezvous with Cesare and Isabella in the form of a low-stakes race around the ruins – perhaps a nod to one of Mafia 1’s most infamous missions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There was no bringing a knife (let alone stealth chokeouts) to a gunfight here...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Cesare and Enzo are messing around with Gennaro’s car during his date with Isabella, bandits – I won’t spoil their identity here – swooped in with guns blazing and kidnapped them both. They were really only after Gennaro, and having to take Isabella as well proved to be…well, as you can imagine it ended up severely complicating things for the kidnappers. I got to wield a shotgun in this segment and found that it packed a satisfying punch. There was no bringing a knife (let alone stealth chokeouts) to a gunfight here; I brought Enzo in with an itchy trigger finger.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the aforementioned chase, I was able to run down their wagon – and gun down plenty of the kidnapping cadre – and rescue Isabella, who rewarded Enzo with a kiss (don’t tell the Don!). But while Cesare brought Isabella back home, Enzo still had to get Gennaro back, because returning without either one would leave Enzo equally dead from either father. It’s this section that allowed me to really unleash my inner Sam Fisher, as it was set up for stealth rather nicely in an open area, letting me pick my path and remain undetected. If you give me a stealth option in a game I am going to take it nine times out of ten, and Mafia: The Old Country was no different. The developers told me that they don’t expect most players to make it through the entire area – which was admittedly quite large and stocked with a ton of bad guys – without alerting anyone. I took this as a personal challenge, and while I held out for quite a while, eventually I did get spotted and had to start shooting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while you are in The Old Country’s stealth segments, basic Splinter Cell rules are in effect. You crouch to make less noise, throw coins (or picked-up objects like bottles) to distract bad guys, and can either knife them quickly or try to strangle them unconscious, which triggers a button-mashing QTE you’ve got to be quick about, lest they slip out of your grasp. There are even conveniently placed empty containers around that you can hide the bodies in so that they’re not discovered. The Old Country doesn’t break any new ground here, but in my experience, it does familiar stealth gameplay reasonably well. I do appreciate that there are upgradeable bead slots on your rosary that affect gameplay, like one that dampens the sound of your footsteps.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And I appreciated those dampened footsteps until I reached the last man standing for the kidnappers: Messina, whose real story you’ll learn when you play the game yourself. Enzo challenged him to a knife fight, which Messina accepted by dropping his gun and engaging Enzo on his terms. I was having trouble timing my parries just right in the ensuing battle, but I kept enough blood in Enzo’s body for him to emerge as the victor in the fight. (Side note: I died a couple of times during my three hours while playing on Normal, but there are multiple difficulty levels to choose from if you want to ratchet things up or down.) And after returning to the vineyard, Don Torrisi, after hearing of Isabella’s kidnapping, tells Enzo he wants Messina alive. Whoops. Um, yeah, about that…But ultimately, I did good, the boss said. And Isabella made her feelings quite clear with the smile on her face directed at Enzo.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Home Invasion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 5 – the final one I got to play – let me again flex my stealth muscles by tasking me with infiltrating the home of the man ultimately responsible for calling for the Gennaro (and by collateral damage, Isabella) kidnapping and dragging him out of his house and back to my boss. Or, put another way, to kidnap the kidnapper. This mission could truly have been pulled straight from a Splinter Cell game, as I had my choice of ways up the hillside to the large villa at the top. I kept it quiet, stabbing my way through the human obstacles in front of me before eventually getting into the house and to my target.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn’t be so lucky on the way out, though, as by the time I walked out with my target in tow, everyone still left standing knew what was going on, and I had to shoot my way out. As to what happened to that man I brought to the Don? Well, you’ll find out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Old Country, the New Anticipation</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I left my extended hands-on session with Mafia: The Old Country with very few concerns. In roughly three hours I played three chapters, but how many chapters are there? Whatever the number is, it didn’t feel like a story that was going to be wrapped up in a tidy six hours. I don’t know how long The Old Country ultimately is, but when factoring in the studio president’s comment about wanting everyone to see the end credits roll – as well as the $50 price tag – it’s safe to presume that this won’t be a 40- or even 30-hour game. But for my money, that’s fine. I’m a dad with a job; I’m good with Mafia: The Old Country being a game I can get through in a weekend or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And more importantly, I’m now quite confident I’m going to have a lot of fun playing through this one, however long it lasts. The gameplay mechanics are all solid if familiar, with enjoyable stealth, shooting, knife combat, and driving. And perhaps the most important ingredient in a Mafia game – the story – had me engaged and eager to see where it was going to go. It’ll be good to get back to a Mafia 1 and 2 vibe again. It’s been a long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Given that Elden Ring Nightreign already has a procedurally generated system, the modder notes that players may only notice the difference of the randomizer with variations of Night Bosses. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements," they write. "In the future this can be extended to randomizing enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customization."</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to the vanilla maps, the map randomizer has three option presets. One is similar to the base game, another adds randomization to item rewards, as well as the circle timing and size, while reducing repeating camps in consecutive runs, and another is "extra random" by removing certain guardrails.</p><p>The randomizer mod is also compatible with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/">Seamless Co-op mod</a> that enables two-player co-op, a feature that is missing from the base game, which can currently only be played solo or as a group of three. From Software has confirmed that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-co-op-confirmed-coming-at-a-later-date/1100-6532013/">official two-player mode will be coming</a> to Elden Ring Nightreign, although there is no date for when this will be. The developer's focus instead has been on an update that rolled out earlier this month to address <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1-01-4-is-here-and-delivers-even-more-bug-fixes/1100-6532907/">bug fixes</a>, with also no news yet on balance adjustments.</p>

A group of Diablo 4 content creators recently took to social media to announce they'd seen the future of developer Blizzard's ARPG after attending a special presentation, and that Blizzard has "been cooking" with what it has planned.</p><p dir="ltr">Content creators like Maxroll's <a href="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wudijo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/LuckyLuciano610/status/1943739809945534558" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucky Luciano</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/WarlugTv/status/1944097949648114097" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warlugtv</a> from Mobalytics, took to social media over the weekend to share their excitement and give Diablo 4 players some hope for the future based on what they had seen during a closed Blizzard presentation. Actual concrete details on what was shown weren't shared, but the social media reactions hint at updates or changes to Diablo 4's core systems as opposed to new features related to the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">second expansion slated to arrive in 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth keeping in mind that some of these content creators have officially worked with Blizzard in the past, and it is currently unclear if any of them were compensated for attending the meeting and offering feedback.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Last night some people including myself got a glimpse of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiabloIV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DiabloIV</a> 's future.

Look forward to a lot of stuff coming, let's hope it pans out the way it was discussed," Warlugtv said. "Super excited and actually makes me want to log in."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked on X if the plans Warlugtv saw during the presentation were intended for this year or for 2026, Warlugtv in a <a href="https://x.com/WarlugTv/status/1944135837450416160" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a> said "not sure."</p><p dir="ltr">What all changes are coming to Diablo 4, and when they will be arriving, are still largely a mystery then.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-graphics-lead-puts-out-tone-deaf-hiring-call-with-ai-slop-shortly-after-devastating-layoffs.1243194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>July 2025 kicked off with devastating news for Microsoft employees, as it laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 workers across the entire company,</a> with a significant number of those layoffs hitting Xbox and Microsoft's gaming division. <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">game projects</a> were shut down, veteran developers were either laid off or<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"> left</a> because of the cuts, and amid reports that the layoffs are directly related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft wanting to invest more in its AI efforts</a>, Microsoft and Xbox executives have failed to read the room multiple times.</p>



<p>While claims were circulating that Microsoft and Xbox are<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> "<em>trying their damndest to replace jobs with AI agents</em>,"</a> it was unfortunate, to say the least, that a seemingly automated invite went out to developers inviting them to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">how AI tools can aid in game development</a>. Disdain towards Xbox, Microsoft, and the c-suite executives who didn't lose their jobs compounded when an executive producer at Xbox suggested that <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt">laid-off workers confide in ChatGPT to help them cope with being laid off</a>.</p>



<p>At least executive producer Matt Turnbull's ill-advised LinkedIn post was, at least on the surface, an attempt to help laid-off workers. Principal development lead for Xbox Graphics, Mike Matsel's post, however, is somehow even more tone-deaf and bull-headed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mmatsel_the-xbox-graphics-team-is-hiring-folks-with-activity-7349539853866344449-O1G3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">Matsel put out a call</a> that the Xbox Graphics team was hiring two roles. He specified that the team is looking for people "<em>with experience with device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience</em>." He then links the two job postings, and tells people to message him directly if the postings on Microsoft's website claim to be closed. </p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and even though putting out a hiring call a little more than a week after mass layoffs is never a good look, it's unfortunately a common occurrence. What cinches Matsel's post as tone-deaf, is that he shares an AI-generated image along with his post, which shows someone working at a desktop, presumably looking at nothing, since the image shows their screen on the backside of the monitor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The comments are, unsurprisingly, filled with people digging into Matsel for posting the image, with one person saying "<em>You could have just sketched an ad on paint, at least it would have been funny. This is just embarrassing.</em>" Another, seemingly referencing Matsel's lack of care in his post, wrote, "<em>I too can post AI slop. Put me on the team, coach!</em>"</p>



<p>You have to wonder whether Turnbull and Matsel made their posts earnestly, or if they were baiting the uproar that both posts have caused. Neither is a good look, because if they earnestly made these posts, then that shows a huge inability to read a room, and a lack of understanding as to how they should communicate with others, whether that's trying to communicate a message of empathy, or opportunity. </p>



<p>If they were baiting the reactions, it's surprising and disappointing to see two high-level executives seeking enjoyment out of a situation that has devastated hundreds of their former coworkers and each of their families. </p>

            <p>Gun.</p>
<p>There are a lot of them in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, it being a shooter and all. HD2 players aren't happy for it to end there though.</p>
<p>They've been asked for their input in renaming the single city on Super Earth they've so far succeeded in rebuilding since all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Illuminate invasion business</a>, and they're voting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">Gun</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let's face it, given the precedents set by the likes of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36064659">Boaty McBoatface</a> and its lesser known NASCAR twin the <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2021/05/01/why-kansas-nascar-cup-called-buschy-mcbusch-race-400/4897438001/">2021 Buschy McBusch Race 400</a> (yes, that was a name given to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Buschy_McBusch_Race_400">actual professional motor race</a>), this isn't a surprise.</p>
<p>Having managed to rebuild the city of Remembrance through their recent Galactic War efforts, players are currently voting in an <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1391934973841375273">Arrowhead-run Discord poll</a> dedicated to deciding on a new name for it. A new name by which to remember Remembrance. Yep, the whole thing's the usual kind of Helldiversy meta-joke that's still managed to make me crack a grin.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Cue the equally jokey response thus far. 35k and counting votes, that's over 70% of the total share, to rename the city 'Gun'. Well ahead of the second place runner 'Everlasting Memory', which currently boasts just over 9k votes, and third place 'New Remembrance' at 3k. Now, the option that's currently last, 'Peacebeacon's Bloodlight', I'd argue deserves to be there, but I think fourth place 'Winds of Change of Tides of War' warrants a bit more than just over 1k votes.</p>
<p>Sure, it's far too long, but you could abbreviate it to the snappy WoCoToW, which would only make you sound a bit like an alarmed space bird being attacked by a Terminid whenever you say it. Plus, long-winded and grandiose bollocks is the name of the game with HD2's Starship Troopers-ish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">satire of the fash</a>. Did everyone just forget naming their ships something like 'Ombudsman of Individual Merit'?</p>
<p>Anyway, they're clearly gonna name it 'Gun', which is still at least minor chuckleworthy and also feels very 2025. That is to say, I'm not too pistolff about it.</p>
<p>Gun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun]]></content:encoded>

Hype levels are starting to run dangerously low. While<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is shaping up to be a big shot in the console’s launch window arm later this week, the rest of the Switch 2's first year is filled with question marks right now.

They might finally be in luck. According to reliable leaker NatetheHate, a new Nintendo Direct is coming before the end of July. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,197533" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“From what I have been told, there is a direct this month,” the YouTube podcaster, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104">who correctly reported</a></span> the timeframe for the Switch 2's original showcase, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y&amp;t=1920s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y&amp;t=1920s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on his latest episode</a></span>. “So, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <em>Donkey Kong Bonanza </em>releases.” That game comes out July 17, and with Nintendo often opting for showcases in the middle of the week, we’re left with likely dates of July 22-24 and 29-31. </p><p>“Beyond beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point,” NatetheHate continued. “If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st which is Nintendo’s earning report day. So, I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investors’ report.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode, the leaker dives into all the reasons fans are getting impatient for the next Switch 2 showcase. Nintendo has a big first-party fall lineup, but not much of it is Switch 2 exclusive at the moment. We still need dates for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (cross-gen) and <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>(Switch 2 only). All of the big third-party ports like <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>are slated for 2025 but haven’t been nailed down either. </p><p>According to NatetheHate,<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is definitely coming to the Switch 2, but it’s unclear if that would get announced in a Nintendo Direct or via a standalone trailer by Rockstar Games. There’s also been a surprising lack of support from Microsoft so far. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>is seemingly feasible on the new hardware, but is currently only announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is also getting ported to Xbox. While a stretch, that would probably be the biggest Switch 2 surprise of all if it somehow became a reality.</p><p>There’s also the mysterious absence of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft made promises to bring the franchise back to Nintendo platforms as part of its Activision acquisition, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">and the latter confirmed</a></span> that both sides were working on something that would be announced in the future. Does that start this year with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or in 2026 with the next sequel? Nintendo was reportedly being very precious with Switch 2 devkits during development, so it’s hard to have a good sense of who may have projects in the pipeline already and who is playing catchup. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">Finally, there’s the question of Mario</a></span>. It seems clearer than ever that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is being made by a portion of the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team but not all of it, freeing up the others, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019">like Nintendo veteran Yoshiaki Koizumi</a></span>, to work on the next 3D <em>Mario</em> game. It feels like we’re running out of time (and room) for the next one to arrive this fall, but the 2026 spring window could be a decent bet. Nintendo rarely teases things that are more than a year away at this point, but I’m hoping they make an exception in this case. They’ll want to have the next<em> Mario </em>ready for the next <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie anyway, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">that’s coming in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219]]></content:encoded>
