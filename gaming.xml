<p>Definitive?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Aspyr surprised us all by shadow dropping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop. The 2013 adventure game from Crystal Dynamics is back with a bang, and we've been checking it out so you can see what's in store on Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>In the above video, we've got a whopping 18 minutes of Switch 2 gameplay footage, showcasing the opening escape sequence, some woodland hunting and, of course, a spot of tomb raiding. There's a mixture of gameplay and cutscenes for you to feast your eyes on too, so don't worry about any surprises.</p>
<p>And for those wondering how things compare on Switch 2 between playing with a Pro Controller and Mouse Mode, we've split the video into two, right around the halfway mark, so you can easily compare the control methods.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks... fine. The visuals are a little lacking for a Switch 2 'Definitive Edition' release, but we have to remember that this one has also landed on Switch 1, which is potentially what the game was optimised for in the first place.</p>
<p>Either way, Tomb Raider 2013 is back, and we're pleased with the chance to play it on the go! We'll have our full review with you shortly, so keep an eye out to see what we make of Lara's latest (re)adventure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a minute since we've had a good ol' Wild West game, and while&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;technically isn't recent, this new port from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a> comes with a number of improvements to revitalize this lesser-known FPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many westerns, tragedy is at the heart of this tale. James Anderson, former lawman and current badass, is on a quest for revenge after his peaceful life in retirement is ruined. With his wife deceased at the hands of some outlaws, and his daughter kidnapped by the very same, it's time to put the "Wild" in Wild West.</p>



<h2>Another Great Remaster Treatment from Nightdive</h2>

<p>Like most games from 1997, there's always some jank to be expected. That's why we can always trust Nightdive Studios to do a good job to make games feel modern and revitalized, which is the case here with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The most noticeable difference between the original and its remaster is a fresh coat of paint. Every aspect of this title gets an improvement, visually. Weapon and enemy models are touched up, textures (from the ground you're standing on to the skyboxes above) are expertly recreated, all the while retaining their retro charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other noticeable improvements can be found in its cutscenes. Now,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;stands out a bit with its cartoonish cutscenes, with the excellent animation of characters making the story feel more like a classic, animated movie. These cutscenes are also brushed up to look cleaner for the modern day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these visual improvements are enhanced even further with support for high refresh rates and resolutions. If you're familiar with Nightdive remasters, none of this should be a surprise. What I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;like about this remaster is that you can switch from the new graphics to the old seamlessly, so it's always fun to see how areas are improved over the original.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other quality of life improvements come in this package. Controller support, for example, feels great to use even if I much prefer keyboard and mouse. Still, I didn't need to fiddle with the keybindings for my Xbox controller, and I was able to adapt to the control scheme almost immediately, so it's good news for those who prefer gamepads.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-menu-options_0.jpg?itok=1J0o1jhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-menu-options_0.jpg?itok=wQTrJTlq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gyro aim? Now we're talkin'.</figcaption></figure><p>I didn't encounter many bugs, if any at all, though one issue I encountered might qualify. The height of my jump would be really inconsistent; for example, I encountered a tower I had to scale, but my character couldn't jump up the stair-like ledges. I took a break from&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, came back the next day, and the jump worked.</p>

<p>This weird inconsistency was a source of great frustration since it could essentially softlock me in several areas, but it would somehow fix itself if I kept trying or came back later. I really can't tell if this is an error on my part or the game's, but it's worth noting that this might happen to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another issue that isn't related to bugs or anything like that is visibility.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;dark in some areas, and if you run out of lamp oil, you'd better pray you're going the right way. Similarly, crucial objects like keys and crowbars to pry blocked doors felt practically invisible, so these were missed a lot. The pickup radius for these items is also extremely small.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-keys.jpg?itok=P1rfJgGu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-keys.jpg?itok=saRIsP2m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hands up, sir, I'm here for the keys. And directions.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where in Tarnation Do I Go?</h2>

<p>Although it is perhaps more narrative-focused than other FPS games from its time,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is still a classic shooter at its core. This particular FPS is created by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a>&nbsp;team, and that happens to be one of my favorite games of the genre.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws,</em>&nbsp;then, should be a slam dunk, right?</p>

<p>Well, I'm a bit mixed on this one. Let's start with the setting: It's the Wild West. I was never the biggest fan of westerns, and level design is usually my favorite aspect of boomer shooters. They do a decent job at creating a variety of stages, but I was never blown away by them, perhaps because of my personal biases.</p>

<p>Wild West towns, heavily armed forts, and even a moving train -- these are some of the levels you can expect in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. The train level is probably my favorite, as they usually are, because of their tight quarters and close-ranged combat. That, and I actually knew where to go (forward, obviously), whereas most levels are maze-like to the extreme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=coIxVkUK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=IkvJWBBv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of things to hide, even in a single fort.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>' level design was also maze-like at times, but I never felt lost with the exception of a level or two. In&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, the later levels continued to frustrate me as I bumbled around, looking for whatever the heck this game wanted me to do. Some of the solutions are puzzle-based, which require picking up certain items and interacting with specific objects.</p>

<p>The puzzle design in a number of levels here is obtuse and devoid of fun, and sometimes it was hard to find where you needed to place certain items. I'd wager half of my playtime with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;was because I was lost, which is just so frustrating. The issue with keys being super hard to see in environments exacerbates this issue.</p>

<p>Some levels, particularly in the "Handful of Missions" portion (these are just extra missions separate from the story), feel more well-designed. The Civil War level is an exciting and enemy-heavy level with a fun theme around it, and the Marshal Training missions are shorter but more combat-focused as well -- bonus, you usually don't get lost in these ones.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-combat.jpg?itok=MUhw57UL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-combat.jpg?itok=dnGY2KBl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with a seasoned lawman.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gunslingin' in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions Remaster</em></h2>

<p>The gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;feels a bit different than your traditional boomer shooter. Weapons have high stopping power, often dropping enemies in one or two hits. Even the base pistol, your trusty revolver, can drop most enemies no problem. It's not super accurate at long range, but if you use your alt-fire to fan the gun's hammer, it's a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>The rifle with its scope attachment is crucial, and it's super satisfying to take out a bunch of enemies from afar like a sniper. This is pretty crucial to succeed in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, or else you'll end up dead, and fast.</p>

<p>Enemies are just as lethal as the player, with their guns dealing a large amount of damage any time you're hit. Walk into a room full of enemies without a plan and you'll get dropped in a second, and that makes for quite an exciting time, at least when you're not bumbling around looking for where to go next.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=2OCwZKj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=JXmBCkMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun can be useful&nbsp;<em>sometimes</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of weapon variety, I find&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;to be lacking. There aren't all that many weapons to begin with, and three of them are shotguns. The shotguns all feel the same to use, and frankly, aren't all that viable when you have to reload after each shot. Most of my time was spent using the rifle and revolver, and their ammo is plentiful.</p>

<p>You have dynamite, which is a bit like grenades but more dangerous, and the throwing mechanics for it seem a bit clunky, as well as some knives that I also couldn't figure out how to throw well. If all else fails, you can use your fists and kill most enemies in one hit -- which is actually pretty funny -- but it's dangerous to get in close.</p>

<p><em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;was a FPS I wasn't all too familiar with, despite my quest to consume every boomer shooter ever invented. I was glad to have played this one, especially with Nightdive's improvements, but I don't see myself coming back. Level design is just a bit too obtuse. At this point,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is nearly 30 years old, so there's not much that can be done but to enjoy what is an adequate, if frustrating, shooter in this new remaster.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-ultra-slim-15%E2%80%B3-1080p-portable-monitor-goes-for-pennies-as-amazon-goes-all-in-on-black-friday.1359382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop screens restrict your productivity to a cramped workspace, and portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch merit something way more than their diminutive built-in displays. The <em>Arzopa</em> 15.6-inch <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">portable monitor just hit an all-time low of $74 for Black Friday over at Amazon, down from the usual $104</a>. This ultra-slim display solves your need for extra screen real estate without having to carry around bulky monitors. This <strong>monitor weighs in at just 1.6 pounds and measures 0.35 inches thick</strong> which makes it portable – not just technically movable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Looks Good</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel pushes 1920 by 1080 resolution</strong>&nbsp;which provides crisp text for productivity work and detailed visuals for gaming. IPS technology delivers accurate colors and maintains image quality<strong> across a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you don’t see color shifting or contrast loss when viewing the screen from the side. The display adeptly handles everything from work documents to game graphics. The 1080p resolution nets you enough pixels to comfortably read small text or see fine details in games without everything looking blocky.</p>



<p>This ultra-slim design makes the monitor genuinely travel-friendly: At 1.6 pounds, <strong>you hardly notice it in a backpack beside your laptop</strong> while its 0.35-inch thickness lets it slide into laptop sleeves or backpack pockets designed for tablets. Arzopa built the monitor with metal materials that feel solid without adding any unnecessary weight. The compact form factor fits easily on airplane tray tables, coffee shop counters, or hotel desks where space is at a premium.</p>
<p>An<strong> integrated kickstand negates the need to carry around separate stands</strong> or lean the monitor against a stack of books. The stand adjusts across multiple angles, letting you position the screen for comfortable viewing as you sit at a desk or recline on a couch. It reliably holds position, without slowly creeping closed during use. The integrated approach means you have all you need for setting up without any extra accessories cluttering your bag.</p>



<p>Multiple display modes adapt to different use cases without complicated configuration. Duplicate mode simply mirrors your primary display, ideal for presentations or showing content to others. Extend mode gives you more workspace, expanding your desktop across both screens and effectively doubling your screen real estate. Second screen mode makes the portable monitor a stand-alone display for phones or tablets.</p>
<p>The <strong>USB-C and HDMI connectivity covers</strong> just about every device that you might want to connect. With modern laptops that come with USB-C ports, you can send out video and power over a single cable, meaning no need for a separate power adapter if your laptop provides enough juice. HDMI input handles game consoles, older laptops, and any device with standard HDMI output. Thanks to plug-and-play functionality, you connect the cable and the display works right off without drivers installed or visiting configuration menus.</p>
<p><strong>Wide compatibility across laptops, desktops, Macs, phones, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch</strong> means no adapter hassles or workarounds.</p>
<p>For $74, this portable monitor is less than many people spend on a single dinner out and promises legitimate productivity and entertainment value. You get a full HD IPS display with metal construction, integrated stand and universal connectivity for almost 30% off of the regular price.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-flip-5-bluetooth-speaker-hits-its-deepest-price-cut-ever-the-moment-amazon-black-friday-begins.1359379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Good music means good vibes. The right speaker can bring any party or gathering to life. If you have been after something that delivers powerful sound that’s rich and deep, yet balanced for all your tracks, without spending big bucks, Amazon is making the upgrade easier than ever.</span></p>
<p>The retailer is now offering its early Black Friday sales across a wide range of categories, including audio gear. We are spotting deep discounts on headphones, earbuds, and even some top-rated Bluetooth speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/">One of our favorite markdowns from the sale? The JBL Flip 5, which is now going for just $80 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> The offer applies to almost all color options, so there’s plenty to choose from. These include black, red, white, teal, and even the most stunning pink!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both Prime and non-Prime members can snag the deal, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase. This is the lowest price this speaker has dropped to in the last 30 days, but we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. Snap it up before it expires for good.</p>

<h2>Portable Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This can-sized Bluetooth speaker is easy to carry around with you on the go. It features a durable fabric and rugged rubber housing that prevents it from everyday wear and tear. You won’t have to continuously worry about keeping it safe on your trips. Just toss it in your bag and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. With up to 20 watts of power, it delivers JBL signature sound that’s both rich and balanced. It captures all the highs and lows exceptionally well, making podcasts come through clearly and bringing your favorite tracks to life. The sound is big enough to spread evenly through most places, but you can always pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers for stereo sound or multiple compatible speakers for a much larger experience. This way, you can host your very own private concerts right there in the yard!</p>
<p>The IPX7 rating means you can take your speaker with you on the beach, by the pool, or even in the shower without a worry. In fact, the JBL Flip 5 is waterproof up to three feet deep, so even an accidental drop in water won’t hurt these. You can focus on enjoying the songs instead of babysitting the speaker all the time.</p>



<p>The built-in 4800mAh rechargeable battery lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge. That’s enough to keep the party going all night long. Just plug these in the morning for an hour or so, and enjoy all your favorite tracks the entire night with friends. The speaker works well with a range of devices, and you just need to have a stable Bluetooth connection to get started. All that you need to do is turn the speaker on, enable Bluetooth on your desired device, and choose the speaker from the list of available options. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. There’s also a quick start guide included in the box, which you can refer to if you run into any issues while pairing it.</p>
<p>All things considered, this tiny but mighty Bluetooth speaker not only offers powerful, rich sound but also gets you an impressive battery life. It’s reliable enough to take with you on the go, as can handle everyday wear and tear well. If you’re planning to host some fun gatherings during the holiday season or just want to enjoy your favorite songs in a more immersive way, now is the time to act.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade’s storage requirements have been changed for the Nintendo Switch 2, now coming in close to 100GB. </p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 recently, with devs stating they are considering a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole new game</a> after the release of the final part. However, in the meantime, development on FF7 Remake Intergrade continues for Switch 2, and it seems the game will take up almost half of Switch 2’s base storage space. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-will-take-up-almost-half-of-switch-2-s-storage-space">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Will Take Up Almost Half of Switch 2’s Storage Space</h2>



<p>The announcement about changes towards Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade 2’s storage size on the Switch 2 was revealed through a new official post on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The standard edition of the title will now range from 90GB to 95GB, up from the previously announced 87.8GB. The Limited Early Purchase Edition and the Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Edition will be priced between 93.8GB and 99GB. These changes will reflect on the Nintendo Store pages soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">October was an incredible debut month for Battlefield 6: it's officially the best-selling title in franchise history in the U.S., and the best-selling game in the U.S. as of last month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's monthly report, which states that Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game of 2025 on both Xbox and PC, and the second best-selling on PlayStation so far, behind NBA 2K26. It<em> also </em>says that Battlefield produced the highest single month tracked full game dollar sales total of any video game in three years. That means it sold more than the last few Call of Duty games did in their debut months, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October of 2022. Is this troubling news for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November report comes out? We'll see.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is followed by Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which is the second best-selling game of October and, per Circana, the best-selling physical game year-to-date. Notably, because Nintendo does not share digital sales data, its second-place spot is entirely based on physical sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other debut games for October included The Outer Worlds 2 at No.7, Little Nightmares III at No.8, and Ninja Gaiden 4 at No.11. Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake didn't make it to the top 20, but it was No.6 on Nintendo platforms for the month. There weren't any other major outliers in the charts this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending was up 36% year-over-year to $351 million, with the Nintendo Switch 2 offsetting declines in the other three major consoles: Nintendo Switch (sales down 52% year-over-year, wonder why?), Xbox Series (down 37%), and PlayStation 5 (down 22%). The Nintendo Switch 2 sold approximately 328,000 units in October, 68% ahead of the original Nintendo Switch's pace and 3% ahead of the PlayStation 4, which was the previous record-holder.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to Battlefield, the Nintendo Switch 2, and a good month for mobile, overall game hardware, content, and accessories spending was $4.9 billion for the month, up 3% year-over-year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">October 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Battlefield 6 (NEW)</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A (NEW)*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2 (NEW)</li><li>Little Nightmares III (NEW)</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4 (NEW)</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2*</li><li>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Silent Hill: f</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

The game also looks stunning in action, and if you grew up playing the Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi games, then this will appeal to you as it's a continuation of that series.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBRK93?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBQGRQ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZQGXWSH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$30 (was $50)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>In comparison, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an action-RPG that blends fast-paced fisticuffs with level-grinding. The game also gives you a world to explore as you take part in Goku's greatest battles across the Dragon Ball storyline, and since launch, publisher Bandai Namco has expanded on the game with several story DLC drops inspired by classic OVA series and Dragon Ball Super. The Daima Edition does <em>not </em>include those expansions, but it does come bundled with the two-part Daima DLC, which is based on the Dragon Ball Daima anime series. One thing to note here is that only the first part has been released so far, and Part Two will arrive in early 2026.</p>                      </div>   </div><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Four notable free Switch 2 updates for big-name Nintendo games--such as Super Mario Odyssey--surprisingly came from outside the company. Instead of an internal developer, Panic Button has confirmed working on the following titles for the new hybrid console: Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, and Arms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/panicbuttongame/status/1991264499676930507?s=46" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Panic Button revealed its involvement on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/#3">the free Switch 2 updates</a>. "Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games," the Austin-based developer stated on social media. The improvements included HDR support for Arms, Super Mario Odyssey, and Bowser's Fury. In addition, GameShare support was added to Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/panicbuttongame/status/1991264499676930507?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.

For instance, the team was behind Doom and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-is-still-coming-to-nintendo-switch/1100-6461091/">Doom Eternal for the original Switch</a>. Panic Button assisted on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-an-impressive-/1100-6463299/">porting Warframe to Switch</a> as well. Most recently, the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/">worked on Forza Horizon 5 for PS5</a>--marking the first time the racing franchise has appeared on a PlayStation platform.</p><p>In other Nintendo-development news, the company actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-buys-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-port-studio-ahead-of-switch-2-launch/1100-6523597/" data-ref-id="1100-6523597">acquired Shiver Entertainment</a>--a studio known for porting games like Hogwarts Legacy to Switch--last year. Shiver reportedly assisted in bringing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/#2">WWE 2K25</a> to Switch 2. Meanwhile, Panic Button is a private company. Speaking of ports, Switch and Switch 2 just saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-just-surprise-released-on-switch-and-switch-2/1100-6536324/">surprise release of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> earlier this week.</p>

                <p>While Fortnite is currently in the midst of a Springfieldian takeover by The Simpsons, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-7-start-date-new-map-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6536068/" data-ref-id="1100-6536068">next chapter of the battle royale's overarching story</a> will soon be upon us.

<p>Is that... Mr. Biffo?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Clear River Games has released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> for the Switch, and to celebrate its arrival, a new launch trailer has hit the web, and it's a <em>doozy</em>.</p>
<p>The live-action trailer stars none other than Paul Rose, who served as the editor for <strong>The Digitiser</strong>, a video games magazine for Teletext back in the '90s and early '00s. You might know him best as Mr. Biffo, and his short appearance here is undeniable.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've got a small cameo from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Stick</a> at the beginning, while the rest is a nostaligia-filled look at the classic R-Type gameplay, remastered for the Switch. It's looking slick with smooth visuals and 60fps gameplay, and we can't wait to dive in.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 Arrowhead fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is R-Type Delta!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios have settled on a release date for their co-op horror platformer, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>, settling on Friday, 13th February 2026.</p>
<p>The game is coming from the creators of Little Nightmares I &amp; II, and it sticks with their particular penchant for dark and unsettling imagery and creatures tormenting small people. In this game a brother and sister have to try and go through this hell to rescue missing friends and escape an island they once called home.</p>


<p>Pre-orders are now open across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and today also sees the release of a demo for the game on consoles (already available on PC) for fans to try out. The co-op demo starts at the beginning of the game, reuniting the protagonists and presenting you early environments at the Mill and the Trainyard to play through.</p>
<p>The demo is also coming to Switch 2 at a later date, and pre-orders for Nintendo’s handheld will be on hold until then.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pokemon-legends-z-a-tops-us-sales-charts-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-and-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-top-us-sales-charts-for-october-2025.1359328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has released the latest monthly charts for US video game sales for October 2025, and the two games at the top of the charts are the two games you would have expected to be there: Battlefield 6 and Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Those were the top two games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> in first place and Pokémon Legends Z-A in second, though it's worth remembering that Nintendo doesn't share its digital sales data with any of the big analytics firms, Circana included, which means that on physical sales alone, it had a stronger month than 18 other games, some of them new releases, some of them sales-charts-topping regulars like EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26.</p>



<p>It also could mean that, were digital sales properly included, Pokémon Legends Z-A might have been listed as the actual best-selling premium game in the US for October 2025. But we can't know its digital sales, so that crown goes to Battlefield 6.</p>







<p>Number one on the sales charts for the month of October in the US isn't the only crown Battlefield 6 is walking away with, as it also launched right to the top of the list for best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>According to Piscatella, not only did Battlefield 6 become the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, it also "<em>produced the highest single month US physical and digital full game tracked dollar sales total in three years. The last title to generate a larger full game tracked dollar sales total in a single month was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October 2022</em>."</p>







<p>It's all coming up roses for Battlefield 6 on the commercial front, but it's one month away from perhaps the biggest victory it could hope for, which would be maintaining its top spot over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November 2025 sales numbers are in.</p>



<p>Of course, we'll have to wait a while for those numbers, but for now, Battlefield 6 can bask in its top spot for the month, for the year, and in the history of the franchise. Also, it's worth noting that while Battlefield 6 may be the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, when it comes to exclusively physical sales, the best-selling game in the US so far is Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Other notable elements of the list include <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">September 2025's best-selling game in the US</a> dropping all the way to the tenth best-selling game, with Borderlands 4 going from the top spot to halfway down the top-20 list.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 was also able to squeeze into the top-10 in seventh place, just ahead of another new release, Little Nightmares III, which made the list in eighth place. Ninja Gaiden 4, another big new release for October 2025, made the top-20 list, but not the top-10, as it fell just outside the top-10 in eleventh place. </p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be the best-selling console, though what's more impressive is how far ahead it is compared to Nintendo Switch sales for the same time period of its launch year. "<em>It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4's previous record velocity</em>," writes Piscatella.</p>



<p>Another notable hardware tidbit is that spending on ASUS PC portable hardware saw a 4.8x spike led by he release of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. You can find out more about both devices in <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">my interview with ASUS executives last month,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">in my review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, October 2025 was a strong month for video game sales in the US. It saw a 3% growth over October 2024, and included a couple of the year's best-selling games so far. However, the real bout of the year for US sales is currently happening right now, between Call of Duty and Battlefield, with both games officially out and available for players to buy. We'll see which game ends up at the top of the charts for November 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans of AMD’s GPUs, which are typically more cost-effective than those made by Nvidia, might be in for some sticker shock in the near future. Team Red is likely to start raising the price of its goods. And unfortunately, there’s a chance this will affect more than just your graphics card.</p> <p>As <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-rumored-to-raise-gpu-prices-just-as-radeon-rx-9070-xt-finally-reaches-msrp">reported by <i>VideoCardz</i></a>, AMD has informed its partners of an impending price hike for its GPUs. Last month the company reportedly adjusted prices for its corporate partners to reflect changes in the market, though it managed to save retail customers from the shift. This time around, however, retail prices are likely to get hit. The culprit? Well, if you’ve been paying attention to the price fluctuations of computer components, you may already know: the cost of DRAM components, which provide the memory for computers and other electronics, is going up as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-hikes-memory-chip-prices-by-up-60-shortage-worsens-sources-say-2025-11-14/">the AI industry</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/wM8LDVIiwhA">wolfs down</a> the earth.</p>

 <p>And if you’re familiar with what goes inside consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series machines, or even the upcoming Steam Machine, then you know AMD chips power those too.</p> <p>Retail prices haven’t gone up just yet, but the prospect is frustrating.Sure, PC gaming has always been more expensive than just grabbing the latest Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo box and plugging it in, but it’s continued to get worse. And given the central role AMD plays in all of these devices, PC gamers aren’t the only ones likely to get a haircut.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only-2000645733</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only.1359313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>NordVPN just launched its Black Friday deal this morning</strong> on November 20th and matches Amazon’s Black Friday kickoff with aggressive pricing of its own: The NordVPN <em>Basic</em> plan <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">dropped to a record low of $2.99 per month when you commit to 27 months, which works out to $80.73 total instead of the usual $312.93</a>.</p>
<p>VPN services protect your internet privacy, encrypt your connection and let you access content that’s geographically restricted, but most people skip them because monthly costs add up quickly. This <strong>Black Friday pricing makes premium VPN protection cost less than a fancy coffee each month</strong>, and you<strong> get three extra months</strong> thrown in on top of the two-year commitment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<h2>What NordVPN Does for Your Daily Internet Use</h2>
<p>NordVPN <strong>encrypts all the data that travels between your device and the internet</strong> which prevents your internet service provider, government agencies, or hackers on public Wi-Fi from seeing what you are doing online. Normally, your ISP tracks every website you visit and can sell that data to advertisers or hand it over to authorities without your knowledge. The encryption forms a security tunnel that scrambles your traffic into unreadable code and anyone intercepting it sees only gibberish instead of your passwords, bank details, or browsing history.</p>
<p>The service<strong> works by masking your actual IP address</strong> and routing your connection through NordVPN’s servers in the country of your choice. Websites and online services will see the VPN server’s IP address instead of your own, effectively blocking them from tracking your physical location or compiling deeply detailed profiles of what you do online. Based on where you choose, you could appear to browse from within the UK, Japan or anywhere else NordVPN has servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<p>NordVPN currently operates <strong>more than 6,000 servers across 111 countries</strong> which builds the required structure for fast and reliable connections, no matter where you are located or through which region you connect. The distributed server network allows one to always find a nearby server that will impact your speed very little, or connect to distant servers when you need to access specific regional content. Based in Panama, this country has no obligatory data retention laws: It’s also outside of international agreements, including Five Eyes surveillance. In this context, <strong>NordVPN can follow its strict no-logs policy</strong> without any government pressure to capture user data.</p>
<p>For $2.99 per month, the <em>Basic</em> plan will get you the core VPN functionality: secure, fast connections, and the ability to use the service on up to 10 devices simultaneously. Protect your laptop, phone, and tablet, or configure your router to lock down every device on your home network with a single VPN connection. <strong>The 30-day money-back guarantee</strong> lets you try out the service completely risk-free, and you’ll receive a full refund if it doesn’t meet your needs. You’ll save 74% compared to paying month-to-month, and the total cost for 27 months plus those three bonus months drops to just $80.73.</p>
<p>NordVPN Plus plan jumps to $3.89 per month and adds anti-malware protection, ad blocking, tracker blocking and a password manager with breach scanner. Complete at $4.89 monthly includes everything in Plus plan plus scam call protection and 1TB of encrypted cloud storage. Prime plan at $6.89 monthly adds NordProtect identity protection with cyber crime monitoring and insurance coverage.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-solo-4-headphones-2000645533</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-turns-beats-solo-4-into-apple%E2%80%99s-cheapest-headphone-for-black-friday.1359310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good headphones that offer solid sound quality, have a reliable battery life, and are comfortable to wear for an extended period are hard to find. And when you do find a pair that offers all this, the price tag isn’t always the most friendly. In fact, most such options sit well over $250.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that’s not the case today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">Amazon, like most other retailers, is offering plenty of impressive early Black Friday discounts you can score ahead of the event.</a> It has also dropped the price of the top-rated Beats Solo 4 by 35%! Normally, these would run you around $200, but you can now grab them for just $130. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this pair go for in a long time, and the offer applies to all color options. Looking for something minimal? The matte black version looks stunning. Want something with a bit more personality to it? Pink and blue color options are just as heavily discounted. Just note that, like most other big discounts, this one won’t be around for long. If you have been wanting to grab a premium pair without spending a ton, now is the time to act.</p>
<p>Add the product to your cart, and the discount will apply automatically; no coupon codes or complicated procedures to worry about!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Pulls You In</h2>
<p>These headphones feature a premium design. The overall build is super lightweight, and the headband folds down safely when not in use. This means the pair doesn’t take up much space in bags; just fold it, toss it in, and you’re good to go. They are also quite comfortable to wear, thanks to the UltraPlush ear cushions that fit nicely and stay in place throughout the day. You can wear them for hours while travelling, streaming, or gaming without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Powerful sound is made possible with a custom acoustic architecture and updated drivers that deliver the brand’s signature sound. Expect rich, deep audio, whether you’re listening to a podcast, vibing to your favorite songs, or winding down after a long day with some relaxing music. These also support spatial audio with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive, surround-sound experience, which pulls you in. This mode makes it feel like you’re part of whatever’s playing, in real-time, from concerts to action-packed movies.</p>



<p>Best of all, plugging in via USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable lets you stream in a format that preserves the original quality of any recording; perfect for when you want to experience a more detailed texture in your music. Calls get a boost, too. The upgraded microphones are smart enough to automatically reject background noise (chatter, laughter, traffic) on your end while precisely targeting your voice. You can attend meetings and catch up with friends even in busy cafes and chaotic subways!</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last up to 50 hours on a full charge. That’s more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging the pair in. Recharging is fast, as well, and you can get an additional five hours of listening with just a quick 10-minute top-up. Compatibility-wise, the Beats Solo 4 work well with both Android and iOS devices. Pairing them with smartphones, tablets, computers, and more hardly takes a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The pair is now down to $130, which makes grabbing these quite affordable right now.</a> The discount could wrap up soon, however, which is why it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time. All color options are discounted, so you can grab the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

              <p>Homer will break new ground in <em>Fortnite</em>: his underpants version will blast its nips, unlike every previous bare-chested skin before it. It’s all seemingly part of the next beat in the battle royale’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-fortnite-homer-mascots-santa-monica-2000645254">ongoing <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season</a>.</p> <p>While a giant naked Homer was shown off in the latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buwIZkFuBA0">Multiplidiocy</a>” animated trailer this week, the actual giant Homer skin <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1991097774012797411%7Ctwgr%5E6b2bc80873737b841841aee64dc4d0c99c09bc95%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fleaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples%2F1100-6536357%2F">has also leaked</a> ahead of its introduction to the game, confirming the existence of nipples. Casual fans might be thinking, “So what? I’ve seen Homer’s nipples dozens of times before.” Yes, yes you have. We all have. But not in <em>Fortnite</em>, a game which has famously refused to put nipples on character skins until now.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples/1100-6536357/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As <em>GameSpot</em> points out</a>, a shirtless Travis Scott performed nipple-less in<em> Fortnite</em> way back in 2019. Bare-chested skins for Castaway Jonesy, Menace, TheGrefg, Raz, Dude, and others all had their nipples nerfed as well. Kong was not immune. Neither was Avatar’s Aang. Even Drax and Blanka had their glands removed. The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.resetera.com%2Fthreads%2Fhelp-me-understand-male-nipples-in-japanese-media.455356%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw35zTq1Jgy_2Lw9GQ7eKL7n&amp;ust=1763734655381000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;opi=89978449&amp;ved=0CBkQjhxqFwoTCPCNtOT1gJEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">mighty Goku</a> was stripped as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First look at New (Giant) Homer Skin! <a href="https://t.co/LI2ibt7SfM">pic.twitter.com/LI2ibt7SfM</a></p> <p>— Dr Cacahuette – FN Leaks (@DrCacahuette) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So why is Homer different? Is he just more cartoony than the others, and so Epic Games is less squeamish about adding a pair of dots to his cel-shaded character model? Or is this the company dipping its first toe into the pond, with more realistic anatomy to eventually follow for other characters?</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/here-are-a-bunch-of-other-video-game-nipples-1818495101">Other companies</a> haven’t shied away from adding nipples to lots of other cartoon-y video game characters. Sora from <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> had nipples all the way back in the PS2-era, when they probably took all week to animated and half the RAM to render. Even Nintendo bravely <a href="https://kotaku.com/marios-supposed-to-be-cute-which-is-why-his-nipples-gr-1828557226">let&nbsp;Mario’s nips go free</a> in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, though it has <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-it-seems-has-removed-marios-nipples-1844723285">occasionally censored them</a> in other contexts.</p> <p>It’s nice to see Epic Games finally catching up.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s <em>Simpsons</em> season is set to end on November 28, so it probably won’t be long until whatever final showdown Epic has planned with giant naked Homer goes into effect. That’s likely when the new skin will drop. After that, well, the company is already trying to get fans hyped for its next big Hollywood takeover: <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-kill-bill-yukis-revenge-lost-chapter-tarantino-2000645687"><em>Kill Bill</em></a>.</p>

<p>Reanimal is releasing on February 13, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p>



<p>Tarsier Studios announced their upcoming title, Reanimal, at Gamescom Opening Night <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>, with a trailer that got many players excited. The developers are also experienced in this space, bringing players the first two Little Nightmare games and LittleBigPlanet 3. </p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-release-date-set-for-february-13-2026-pre-orders-are-live">Reanimal Release Date Set for February 13, 2026; Pre-Orders Are Live</h2>



<p>The release date for Reanimal was spotted by Shinobi602 on <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1991512993218326945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The release date announcement also comes with other news: first, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S demos for the title will go live today. Secondly, pre-orders for Reanimal are live as well, with the bonus being exclusive Foxhead &amp; Muttonhead masks. Digital Deluxe edition buyers will get a Season Pass for all 3 DLC chapters along with the pre-order bonus. </p>



<p>Reanimal is a co-op horror-adventure where players experience the story of a brother and sister who set foot in hell to save their friends. The region the players explore is filled with tension and a thick atmosphere as they traverse by boat and on land. Exploration is key, as the main path is only one part of the story, with many mysterious locations and their own stories to tell. The title is fully playable in single player and local &amp; online co-op, it also has “a shared, directed camera, designed to maximise claustrophobia and tension.”</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 and didn't need much time to become 2025's best-selling game overall in the US based on dollar sales. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wlx7h2s2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana released its latest monthly report today</a>, confirming that Battlefield 6 was October 2025's No. 1 best-selling game and, after just three weeks on sale, became the No. 1 best-selling game of 2025 for physical and digital sales.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is also the No. 1 best-selling game on the Xbox and PC charts for 2025, while it ranks No. 2 for 2025 on PlayStation (second only to NBA 2K26).</p><p>EA's new Battlefield game also became the best-selling game in Battlefield franchise history in the US for its first month. 2018's Battlefield 1 was the previous record-holder, and in fact, the first-month sales volume for Battlefield 6 has surpassed the lifetime sales of Battlefield 1.</p><p>Outside of the Battlefield franchise, Circana confirmed that Battlefield 6 had the highest one-month US and physical full-game dollar sales for any game in the past three years. Not since 2022's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II did any game generate more first-month physical and digital full-game dollar sales. This would seem to mean that the first-month sales of Battlefield 6 were higher than 2024's Black Ops 6, 2023's Modern Warfare III, and every other game since 2022, except Modern Warfare II.</p><p>A key point to consider in this comparison is that Black Ops 6 was the first game to launch into Xbox Game Pass--this was apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">massively negative for direct sales of the game</a>. Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and in a break from tradition, Activision's celebratory first-weekend post <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any data about how the game is performing</a> compared to past games. Before this, Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-does-worry-about-fatigue-as-black-ops-7-arrives-right-after-black-ops-6/1100-6535019/" data-ref-id="1100-6535019">acknowledged "fatigue" around the Black Ops brand given the back-to-back releases of Black Ops 7 in 2024 and Black Ops 7 in 2025. </a></p><p>A significant caveat to be aware of here is that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wm7vqdq2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo does not participate in Circana's tracking</a>. Circana previously announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-the-biggest-physical-game-launch-in-years-in-us/1100-6535737/" data-ref-id="1100-6535737">Pokemon Legends: Z-A had the biggest physical game launch in years in the US.</a></p><p>So far, EA has only confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">Battlefield 6 sold 7 million copies out of the gate</a>. An industry analyst said that figure later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">grew to 10 million</a>, though EA has not confirmed this.</p><p>Many are wondering if Battlefield 6 is selling well enough to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year. That remains to be seen, and many will be looking to Circana's November report coming in December for more information. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

The game also focuses on the bond between humans and their Digimon, and Time Stranger improved on the traditional turn-based combat systems for this new release. When you're not battling, you can also live your best digi-life by building a home and running a Digi-shop, which in turn opens the door to more questing opportunities.</p><p>"Digimon Story: Time Stranger is a strong argument that it's high time to give the digital monsters their own space in the critter-catching genre. Strong voice acting and mature themes digivolve this time-traveling tale into an emotionally-rewarding journey of grief and self-acceptance, and a vast array of branching options keeps team-building and the turn-based combat exciting," Jordan Ramée wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/digimon-story-time-stranger-review-the-digivolution-is-up-and-running/1900-6418422/">Digimon Story: Time Stranger review</a>.</p><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h2><p><strong>Video Game Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ivKJW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K5Vm3y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Game Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p8zbIU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X Game Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Video Game Accessory Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p2B5eJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47JNduJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Accessory Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pe08uO" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Accessory Deals</a></li></ul><p><strong>Controller Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4i06ETu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 1/2 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4oMC9TI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49sUOiJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Controller Deals</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3K2LwPQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Controller Deals</a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Deal - Save $45 On Play Booster Box</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>   </ul> </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Four words I did not expect to hear from former Xbox 360 boss Peter Moore when we spoke recently were: "I was Ken Kutaragi." As in, Ken Kutaragi, the widely acknowledged 'father of PlayStation' - the engineer and businessman who designed the original PlayStation consoles and led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/sony-computer-entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>, until Kaz Hirai took over later in the PlayStation 3 era. But those four words were the words Peter Moore said.</p>
<p>He was referring to a role he played shortly before Xbox 360 launched, when Microsoft executives tried to put themselves in Sony's shoes, so to speak, and figure out what the company's plans were for PlayStation 3 - the console they'd be up against. This involved closing themselves away in a hotel room and pretending they were Sony executives coming up with a PS3 plan.</p>
<p>"We spent three days war-gaming prior to the launch of Xbox 360 pretending to be the other guy to understand what we needed to do," Peter Moore told me in part two of a large Xbox 360-related interview.</p>
<p>"I was Ken Kutaragi, and I took the role of PlayStation and what would I do? This was a fascinating process where we war-gamed; locked ourselves in a hotel conference room for two, nearly three days, if I recall, and played out scenarios almost like it's in the Situation Room [in the White House] and we're figuring out… And it surfaced some of the strategies and tactics that we then deployed which became successful for us."</p><p>That Xbox 360 era for Microsoft was characterised by Moore and his fierce challenger-brand mentality, in which Xbox took the fight to PlayStation in order to chip away at its dominant market share - which it did. This involved securing huge licenses for the platform, such as Grand Theft Auto 4, and stoking the fires of what we now know as the console war. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-was-brought-in-to-start-throwing-punches-veteran-exec-peter-moore-reflects-on-the-particular-set-of-talents-microsoft-needed-to-make-xbox-360-challenge-playstation-3">As Moore said in a story we wrote yesterday, he was brought in especially to "start throwing punches"</a>.</p>
<p>But play with fire and you might get burnt. "If you're going to stick your chin out you're going to get punched," said Moore. "I got a lot of abuse, a lot of criticism. Still do, to this day, all the way back to the Sega days. People will sometimes write vile things."</p>
<p>Moore famously also launched the Dreamcast at Sega, a beloved console that also resulted in Sega backing out of the console hardware business. And some people blame Moore for that - still. "I celebrate nine, nine, ninety-nine every year, the launch of the Dreamcast, and I do it because it was an amazing time in my life personally and I worked with so many great people," he told me. "I still think the Dreamcast broke some barriers and it passed the baton to Xbox, bluntly, to build Xbox Live. There was SegaNet before there was Xbox Live.</p>
<p>"But there's this internet myth that somehow I killed the Dreamcast, or I used the Dreamcast as a career stepping stone to go to Microsoft, and nothing could be further than the truth. But I will - even this last time, September 9th of 2025 - still get comments from people, who I think are old enough to know better now, of just disgusting personal attacks."</p>
<p>Perhaps that's the price of leadership, he mused. And he's hardened to it. He's had to; after all, he spent years leading EA. "And nobody took - and still takes - more abuse than EA," he said. "Fine.</p>
<p>"But people don't know what it takes to bring a game to market, to create these things. How much love and sweat and tears go into creating these magnificent interactive experiences. It's always a shame; I always feel actually sorry for the people who feel compelled to type these letters on a keyboard, personally attacking developers and publishers and going after people. It's kind of sad."</p><p>Peter Moore has since moved on from video games. Most notably, he was CEO of Liverpool Football Club for three years, highlighting his lifelong passion for sports and in particular football. He now owns a football  (soccer) team in America, part-owns a football team in Poland, and advises the football club that actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney took over a few years back: Wrexham. All of this - his whole career - he recently put down on the pages of <a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/book/10.3828/9781836245797">an autobiographical book called Game Changer, which has just been released</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview">Parts one</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-how-peter-moore-and-microsoft-made-xbox-360-a-cultural-phenomenon-the-big-xbox-360-interview-continued">part two of our big Peter Moore Xbox 360 interview</a> are both now available on the site to read.</p>

            <p>
We already knew the Xbox Series X/S version of last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake was likely imminent thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/esrb-rating-confirms-silent-hill-2-remake-is-finally-on-the-way-to-xbox-consoles">recent ratings board sightings</a>, but it turns out the wait is already over - for Australian players at least. It's available to download right now via the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-au/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV">Australian Xbox Store</a>, suggesting a global launch announcement will feature during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-for-later-this-week-focused-on-third-party-games">tonight's Xbox showcase</a>.</p>
<p>
Developed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> (the studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> and this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>), the Silent Hill 2 remake initially launched as PlayStation 5 console exclusive in October last year, arriving on PC at the same time. It was a good 'un too, successfully managing to modernise the 2001 survival horror classic without losing any of the qualities that helped make the affecting original one of the most beloved games of all time.

<p>
Both the original and Bloober's remake follow protagonist James Sunderland as he journeys to the titular town after receiving a message from his dead wife. Soon the fog closes in and all manner of horrors begin to reveal themselves. "It doesn't matter if you've never played Silent Hill 2 before," Eurogamer contributor (and Silent Hill super-fan) Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">wrote in her five-star review</a> of the remake last year. "It also doesn't matter if you have. [The] heady blend of old and new delivers the best horror I've played for years... How it looks, how it sounds, how it plays, how it iterates and modernises whilst honouring its cherished source material. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is as close to perfect as I could have ever hoped. And my hopes were high, my friend."
</p><p>
Which is to say Xbox Series X/S owners have been missing out on a stellar horror experience. But if today's perhaps unintentionally early Australian release is any indication, that wait will soon be over for all players. Better still, the Australian release (which comes in both standard and deluxe edition forms) is listed with a massive 50 percent discount, meaning Xbox players can get a brilliant game at a fantastic price. Presumably, the remake was initially set to shadow-drop during tonight's third-party focused Xbox Partner Showcase, but scheduling mishaps with the Australian release has spoiled the surprise. 
</p>
<p>
All this does at least mean Xbox Series X/S owners will get to enjoy the Silent Hill 2 remake ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-receives-teaser-trailer-for-film-adaptation-revealing-pyramid-head-and-release-date">next year's movie adaptation</a>, Return to Silent Hill, which is being directed by Christophe Gans, who helmed the original Silent Hill movie back in 2006. Will it be any good? I'm apprehensive, but after Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake and this year's brilliant Silent Hill f, the series is clearly on a bit of a roll. Speaking of Silent Hill f, it's great stuff despite some big changes, and its fascinating approach to story telling even sold me on New Game Plus - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time">no other game has managed in 40 years</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One week on from the big content update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, adding the new Stella Montis map and more to the game, Embark Studios has released the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, focussing on bug fixes, balance changes, and with a little surprise for good measure.</p>
<p>There’s a few nerfs here, which Embark will need to be rather cautious in leaning on too heavily, as demonstrated by many previous multiplayer games. From the PvP angle, the Venator has been chewing through other players at close range, so its fire rate upgrades have been dropped significantly. Meanwhile, PvE focused players will be disappointed by the explosive damage nerf, which Embark felt was hitting too many parts of larger enemies and making things like the Hullcracker too effective – which you’d want it to be, given how awesome that name is.</p>


<p>Beyond that, it’s mainly bug fixes – stopping ARCs from going outside of maps, fixing a few crashes, and the like.</p>
<p>here’s the full ARC Raiders 1.3.0 patch notes:</p>






<p><b>Deadline</b><wbr></p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Launcher ammo crafting is available at the Workbench without needing a blueprint.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Venator</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note: </b>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Explosive Damage</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note:</b> We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<hr>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Shredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder movement and handling updated: slightly reduced turn speed, improved braking, stiffer suspension, and more consistent reactions to impacts for steadier behavior in combat.<wbr></li>
<li>Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dam Battlegrounds</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Spaceport</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Added collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Blue Gate</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets; shots now pass through as expected.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Stella Montis</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.<wbr></li>
<li>Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using Raider Voice (proximity chat) on PCs without AVX2 support.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when surrendering after reconnecting to a session.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where scavenging parts from the Shredder could leave behind invisible collisions.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Trials weekly rollover could display an outdated rank; the celebration now reflects the correct current rank and the UI remains accurate during the cooldown period.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.<wbr></li>
<li>Your Raider Den has been ducked out.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Aphelion<wbr>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone within the game's first week on sale.</p>

<p>As announced on social media,&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1991397741881356657" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">racked up 500,000 sales</a> across all of the platforms on which it's currently available. Given that it's a niche soccer RPG, that's a pretty impressive number for the game's first seven days.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>game in some pretty illustrious company as well; it's sold the same amount as indie hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">"anxiety horror"&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">cozy RPG&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=NvsFBLDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=8TIT053i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has sold half a million copies since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is Level-5's second major hit this year, following the release of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>back in May.</p>

<p>That game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up half a million sales</a> in its first week as well, and it went on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">pass the million mark</a> before a month had elapsed, so here's hoping that the studio's latest will achieve the same result as well.</p>

<p>It's certainly been a long and strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>. The game was announced all the way back in 2016 under the name&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven Ares</em>,&nbsp;and in the years between then and now, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, receiving a couple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">name changes</a> along the way.</p>

<p>This is the latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>series, and it follows the journey of new protagonists Destin Billows and Harper Evans, with a story taking place a quarter of a century after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>If you're interested in seeing where that lengthy journey ended up, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/231308" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9nvx87zg7wsc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch</a>.</p>
