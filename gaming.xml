            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a new milestone almost four months after the remaster's initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1877626459386212769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), Dragami confirms that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide since its release on September 12th.</p>

<p>While it's true those aren't exactly sales on the level of triple-A hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>or indie smashes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>is a remastered version of an already-niche action game from 2012, so 200,000 isn't a bad figure at all to reach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=0zu3GJbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=Lku5SkXH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has hit the 200,000 sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>remaster was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">announced as a remake</a> back in 2022, with producer Yoshimi Yasuda assuring fans at that point that the game would remain "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>It was officially named&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024" rel="nofollow">the following year</a>, at which point its release was also pushed back to 2024. Following that, Yasuda proved himself true to his word when it turned out that&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">serve as a remaster</a> rather than a full remake.</p>

<p>Back in June, the remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date was set for September</a>. It's one of two 2012 action-adventure games involving auteur Goichi Suda, otherwise known as Suda51, to get itself a remaster this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date" rel="nofollow">the other being&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2012 action game, which was originally developed by Suda51's company Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>

<p>Maintaining the original game's story and atmosphere,&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>features upgraded visuals, "faster action", and plenty of other quality-of-life improvements to bring cheerleader Juliet Starling's zombie-slaying adventure into the modern era.</p>

<p>You can check out <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9NTPB0C2028V/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Here's hoping all this renewed interest in 2012 action games leads to some kind of remaster for&nbsp;<em>Binary Domain</em>. Come on, Sega.</p>

Whether it was the shifting alliances and weaponized duplicity of <em>Shōgun</em>, Gambit’s shocking death in <em>X-Men ‘97</em>, or <em>Baby Reindeer</em>’s penchant for delving to unseen depths of abuse and psychosis, 2024's best shows were mindfucks. And it’s looking like 2025 will be no different.</p><p>To prepare you and your precious brain for the onslaught of twists, cliffhangers, and alien explosions, we have a quick guide to six shows we can’t wait to have fuck up our minds in the best ways possible.  <em>&nbsp;</em><br></p></div></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>February 6</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/invincible-presents-atom-eve/gallery&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/invincible-presents-atom-eve/gallery"><em>Invincible</em></a></span><em> </em>has pulverized our senses with superhero collective slaughtering, humans imprisoned in murderous cyborg bodies, and an orgy full of clones, and they aren’t pulling their punches in the third season. After Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun), aka Invincible, crosses a moral boundary by killing Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) in a multiversal melee for the ages, we may finally be in for his full power to be put on display in <em>Invincible</em>’s typical bloody manner. By the looks of the trailer, which shows Invincible mangling a humanoid cyborg and his angrily retaliating against his “boss” Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins), we’re likely in for feats of superhuman brutality only achievable in animation crafted by some severely disturbed writers.  </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>January 17</p><p>Boredom has never been more suspenseful than it is in the blindingly white halls of Lumon on Apple TV+’s standout series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616"><em>Severance</em></a></span>. We all spent an entire season trying to reprogram our brains to understand a world where humans can sever their consciousness between work and personal life. Then, we spent the next two years trying to figure out why a company that severs people’s minds is herding goats, what happens to severed workers when they’re “fired,” and what the hell these people are actually doing for work. We previewed the second season, and there will be no shortage of tantalizing oddities (and goats) as the the severed workers plot a revolt against Lumon after being awakened in the real world at the end of Season 1. Just as we get answers to questions about the aftermath of the Innies’ awakenings and the complicated four-way relationship between Innie and Outie Mark (Adam Scott) with Innie Helly (Britt Lower) and Outie Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman), we get bombarded with more questions about the perils of reintegration and why there is a child working on the severed floor. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>April 2025</p><p>Watching deadly mutated humans hunt survivors down using the quietest of sounds is terrifying enough before you remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-ces-2025-abby-ellie-dina-1851734101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-ces-2025-abby-ellie-dina-1851734101"><em>The Last Of Us</em></a></span> is based on a video game series and that the acclaimed HBO show hasn’t touched the saddest parts of yet. At the end of the first season, Joel (Pedro Pascal) saves Ellie (Bella Ramsey) from the Fireflies, a resistance group who was going to kill her in the hopes of devising a cure for the plague that has ravaged humanity. He later lies to her about what happened, saying that it simply didn’t work and sparing her the tiny detail that he killed them all. If the second season follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><em>The Last of Us II</em></a></span>’s story (and, in broad strokes at least, it likely will), well, let’s just say that we’re in for even more harrowing and devastating events. The trailer for season two hints at the infected evolving into weather-resistant monstrosities looking to invade Joel and Ellie’s safe haven of Jackson, and posing an existential threat that will surely break our hearts and minds.</p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: N/A</strong></p><p>First off, rest in peace to Chance Perdomo, the late actor who played Andre Anderson in <em>Gen V, </em>and who passed away from a motorcycle accident four months after the first season ended. While we won’t get to see the full, violent extent of his metal manipulation, the show has plenty of mind-bending absurdism to go around. The show that had a superhuman explode someone’s penis by redirecting all of the blood in his body to his groin has a lot more of <em>The Boys</em> universe to show, with no element more intriguing than the virus developed in <em>Gen V</em> with the demonstrable power to mutilate and kill superpowered folks, or “supes.” The last season ended with a school-wide massacre at Godolkin University between supes and normal humans, and the aftermath will likely expose us to the full scope of supe miscreants from that school. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>March 4</p><p>Charlie Cox, who plays Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil) in the <em>Daredevil </em>franchise, has said the Disney+ series <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-actor-born-again-darker-netflix-show/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/daredevil-actor-born-again-darker-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">darker</a></span> than much of the original Netflix series. Remember, the Netflix series had Daredevil famously beating up droves of bad guys in a dark corridor in what is still one of the most iconic moments in any Marvel TV series or film. To get darker than that would really require them to up the ante, and Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) asking Murdock if all that’s left of him “the devil of Hell’s Kitchen” in the trailer makes me believe that the show will be delving deep into the character’s dark side. Plus, we still need to know what happened to him after Thanos snapped away half of the planet, which will surely have us trying to rearrange the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637">MCU timeline</a></span> in our heads. </p></div><div><p><strong>Release date: </strong>N/A</p><p>In Rian Johnson’s remarkable mystery-of-the-week Peacock show, Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) is a former casino worker on the run from her criminal ex-bosses after she uncovers murder and corruption at the casino. One caveat: She has an uncanny ability to detect when someone is lying, a skill that has her solving crimes while on her escape route. What really messes with viewers’ minds is not only trying to figure out how certain crimes were committed, but how seemingly disparate characters and plot points will be meshed together in her big reveal near the end of each episode. She once solved an elderly man’s murder in a retirement facility by detecting the bullshit in two unassuming old ladies who had been plotting this murder because the elderly man got them both arrested during their younger, militant days as anti-government revolutionaries who plotted bombings and assassinations. We may not know exactly when the second season comes, but we sure as hell know that it’ll be full of mysteries the smartest viewer can’t crack. (That won’t stop us from trying, though.) </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The software Lossless Scaling has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/527583114757669394?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major update from developer THS. The Frame Generation component that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> exactly one year ago has been upgraded to version 3.0 (beta), introducing what the developer has described as major improvements across the board in quality, latency, and performance.</p>
<p>Flickering and border artifacts have been reduced, benefiting motion clarity and smoothness alike. GPU load has also shrunk by a sizable 40% compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-universal-frame-generation-2-0-out-now-improves-efficiency-noticeably-reduces-artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSFG 2</a> x2 in non-Performance Mode, while multipliers above x2 have had their GPU load reduced by over 45% compared to the previous version of the software. Perhaps the most welcome enhancements are those in the latency area. According to the developer's latency test, Lossless Scaling Frame Generation 3.0 has 24% lower latency than 2.0.</p>

<p>There's more. This new release unlocks frame rate generation multipliers up to x20. However, the developer shared some recommendations to get optimal results:</p>
<p><em>Base frame rate: A minimum of 30 FPS is required (40 FPS or higher is preferred, with 60 FPS being ideal) at 1080p. </em><em>For best overall experience, locking the game frame rate is recommended. This helps to avoid 100% GPU load (reducing its impact on latency) and ensures smoother frame pacing.</em></p>
<p><em>For higher resolution, use at higher than recommended frame rates or use the "Resolution Scale" option to downscale input to 1080p:</em><br>
<em>For 1440p, set it to 75%.</em><br>
<em>For 4K, set it to 50%.</em></p>
<p><em>Higher multipliers (e.g., X5 or above) are best suited for high refresh rate setups, such as:</em></p>
<p><em>48 FPS × X5 for 240Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X6 for 360Hz.</em><br>
<em>60 FPS × X8 for 480Hz.</em></p>
<p>While new and recent PC games support natively integrated frame generation (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-frame generation</a>) technologies from NVIDIA and/or AMD, older games can still benefit from this tool, especially when heavily modded.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LSFGUI3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>THS also announced that an opt-in Lossless Scaling User Interface 3.0 beta can now be selected by going into your Steam library, right-clicking on the software, selecting properties and then beta from the Betas tab. Last but not least, Windows 11 24H2 users can once again select the DXGI Capture API thanks to Microsoft's recent KB5046617 update.</p>

Very nearly the entire tech industry descends on Las Vegas to give the world an early look at the inventions and ideas they think will define the year. More new, surprising, exciting, and oftentimes ridiculous ideas are debuted on any given day at CES than during most other weeks of the year.</p><p>It’s a ton to keep up with — and it’s also a whole lot of fun. <em>The Verge</em>’s team has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">on the ground</a> in Nevada to try out the wildest products we can get our hands on. There’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337606/ces-2025-smart-home-tv-cameras-power-bank-robot-smart-glasses">a lot of stuff we love</a>. A lot of stuff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338251/ces-2025-weirdest-tech-gadgets-robots">that weirds us out</a>. And a lot of stuff that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340049/honda-zero-saloon-suv-prototype-spec-ces-photos">just downright fun</a> to look at.</p><p>But at the end of the day, some of these ideas and gadgets stuck with us the most. They nailed the execution, surprised us with a great new concept, or otherwise made us leap to tell someone what we’d just seen. These are the things we can’t stop talking about — our best of CES 2025.</p><p><h3>Best TV</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339135/panasonic-z95b-oled-tv-hands-on-ces-2025">Panasonic Z95B OLED</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Panasonic’s Z95B OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Most years at CES, it’d be a guaranteed lock that either LG or Samsung would have the most impressive TV on display in Las Vegas. And sure enough, both the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs">LG G5</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336442/samsung-2025-tv-oled-mini-led-s95f-qn90f-features">Samsung’s S95F</a> look like superb offerings for 2025. We’ve truly entered the brightness wars era of the OLED TV market. LG Display and Samsung Display manage to outdo themselves every year with panels that, at this point, are suitable for any viewing environment and make HDR content pop like never before.&nbsp;</p><p>But at CES 2025, it’s the Panasonic Z95B OLED that I keep circling back to as my favorite. After a long hiatus from the US TV market, Panasonic is coming back for its crown. Like the G5, it features a new four-layer tandem OLED display that boosts brightness to new highs — this time <em>without</em> the <a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/en/2024/01/a-new-era-of-oled-picture-quality-introducing-meta-technology-2-0/">micro-lens array technology</a> that LG Display spent the last two years hyping. It also includes an impressive Dolby Atmos speaker array (tuned by Technics) that will rule out any need for a soundbar for many buyers. That audio hardware results in this being a thick TV by today’s standards: Panasonic obviously favored nailing the picture and sound aspects over a thin design. And you know what? I’m here for it.</p><p>And look, I know: it <em>sucks</em> that Panasonic’s TVs run Fire TV OS. I hope that Amazon and Panos Panay take a sledgehammer to this software in the future and give us something more befitting of such a premium TV. But with Samsung and LG both cramming AI gimmicks down our throats — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337033/lg-samsung-microsoft-copilot-smart-tvs-ces-2025">they’ve added AI buttons to their remotes</a>, even — suddenly just plugging an Apple TV into the Z95B and doing my best to ignore Amazon’s software doesn’t seem so bad. <em>– Chris Welch</em></p><p><h3>Best wearable</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340208/ces-2025-smart-glasses-rokid-halliday-xreal-vuzix-nuance-audio">Rokid Glasses</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>The Rokid Glasses have a display etched into both lenses.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Smart glasses dominated the wearables world at this year’s show. While there were certainly more “advanced” smart glasses out there, Rokid’s stood out because they answered a simple question: “What would it be like if the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses had a display?”</p><p>The micro-etched display on the front of the Rokid Glasses is discreet — almost invisible from the front. There’s no weird protrusion like with the old Google Glass, and it uses a monochrome green light for better visibility in brighter surroundings. It may not be the AR of science fiction, but adding a simple heads-up display felt surprisingly useful. You can see real-time translations — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134180/humane-ai-pin-translation-wearables">I’m a huge translation tech skeptic</a>, but even I have to admit the translation demo worked pretty well on a noisy, busy show floor. There’s a teleprompter function, which feels handy for keeping notes on hand if your job involves a lot of presentations. For taking pictures, you can also see a mini viewfinder that helps you frame a shot. Compared to the Meta glasses, these were also much more lightweight.</p><p>This wasn’t the only version of monochrome monocular smart glasses on the floor — I also tried pairs from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334030/halliday-smart-glasses-ai-tiny-display-frame-availability-price-ces">Halliday</a> and Even Realities. But Rokid’s display was the largest and packed in the most functionality. Smart glasses have a long way to go, and of course I only got a brief demo. But what I saw felt like a practical, approachable take that even my non-techie neighbor might find cool. <em>– Victoria Song</em></p><p><h3>Biggest in show </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">Nitro Blaze 11</a></h4></p><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 handheld gaming PC has a 10.95-inch screen. It weighs 2.3 pounds. It’s so big. Maybe <a href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck">too big</a>. But I kind of want it anyway? <em>– Jay Peters</em></p><p><h3>Best car</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338134/honda-zero-saloon-suv-ev-asimo-os-ces">Honda Zero</a></h4></p><p>Sure, we saw Honda’s new global EV series in concept form at last year’s CES. And sure, EV sales are, shall we say, not looking so great these days, with very little relief on the horizon. But Honda still helped revitalize what was otherwise a sleepy show for auto enthusiasts with the introduction of the Honda 0 Saloon and Honda 0 SUV.</p><p>You have to hand it to the company’s designers, they didn’t pull any punches: there’s a dash of Lamborghini Countach, a dusting of Aston Martin’s Lagonda Shooting Brake, and more than a hint of AMC Gremlin. In other words, plenty of ’70s / ’80s vibes to offset the future shock of the minimalistic interior and marketing-speak about “software-defined vehicles.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whether Honda sticks with this exact design for the final production version, I’m not holding my breath. But there’s enough here that’s weird and different and interesting that some of it is sure to survive through customer deliveries — if we ever get there. <em>– Andrew J. Hawkins</em></p><p><h3>Best friend</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24325152/yukai-engineering-mirumi-robot-ces">Mirumi</a></h4></p><p>Mirumi has absolutely no purpose beyond being a cute fluffy wearable… thing. I’m completely enamored. Give me an army of the little suckers to match every bag.</p><p>The fuzzy sloth-like robot companion latches onto your purse or backpack strap and is designed to imitate a shy (but curious) baby. It doesn’t make noise — a blessing for some — but it will hide its face when touched and move its head around to look at people or objects it detects. It’ll even shake its head to simulate distress if you jiggle it around.&nbsp;</p><p>Mirumi’s creator Yukai Engineering says the robot is supposed to re-create the “joyful experiences” you feel when a real baby glances your way. And given our ga-ga reactions to its googly eyes and stinkingly adorable movements, I’d say it kind of works? There are no fancy (or annoying) AI features at work here, just a solidly simple concept that aims to make you smile. That, in itself, feels like a breath of fresh air now that children’s toys and silly gadgets are starting to feel over-engineered.&nbsp; <em>– Jess Weatherbed</em></p><p><h3>Best monitor(s) </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors">All the 27-inch 4K OLED gaming monitors</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>The ROG Swift OLED PG27UDCM is one of the first crop of 27-inch 4K OLEDs.</em></figcaption> <p><cite><em>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></cite></p></div><div><p>This is what we’ve been waiting for. Last year saw a wave of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075027/want-a-32-inch-240hz-qd-oled-monitor-asus-pg32ucdm-and-msis-mpg-321urx-are-imminent">big, bright, beautiful 32-inch 240Hz 4K QD-OLED gaming monitors</a>. The Alienware version was our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20Victoria%20Song-,Best%20monitor,-Alienware%20AW3225QF">pick of the show last year</a> and one of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYjBf94WY2M&amp;t=510s">favorite pieces of tech of 2024</a> for its lightning-fast refresh, inky blacks, and three-year burn-in warranty. Now you — and by “you” I also mean “I” — will be able to get the same best-of-all-worlds performance in a slightly more reasonable size.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">Alienware</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors">Asus, MSI, and Samsung</a> have all announced 27-inch gaming monitors built around a new QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display. They vary in small details, but all should offer excellent color reproduction, .03ms response time, 240Hz refresh rates, HDR400, and up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness. Choose your favorite and start saving up. Alienware’s is supposed to start shipping in March for $900.&nbsp; <em>– Nathan Edwards</em></p><p><h3>Biggest flex </h3></p><p><h4>Nvidia</h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his CES 2025 keynote. </em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images</cite></p></div><div><p>Nvidia stole the show at CES this year. The company packed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337899/nvidias-ces-keynote-isnt-in-a-ballroom-its-in-a-stadium-and-that-stadium-is-packed">14,000 people into a Las Vegas stadium</a>, all of whom <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337833/after-an-hour-and-twenty-minutes-in-the-nvidia-ces-keynote-line-ive-nearly-reached-the-venue">lined up to see Jensen Huang</a> appear in a flashy leather jacket and reveal Nvidia’s latest tech over the course of a feature-length one-man show.</p></div><div><p>Huang took the wraps off Nvidia’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090 desktop GPU</a>, claiming it would be two times faster than its predecessor. He revealed Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4</a> upscaling tech capable of generating even more frames using AI. And he announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337530/nvidia-ces-digits-super-computer-ai">a tiny $3,000 AI supercomputer called Digits</a>. Later, Huang also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338939/nvidia-jensen-huang-hints-arm-desktop-cpu">hinted at plans to launch a desktop CPU</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>But the biggest flex of all might be that Nvidia is simply everywhere. Its tech powers so many of the devices on the show floor, with its next-gen graphics chips appearing across laptops from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces">MSI</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332194/hp-omen-max-16-elitebook-x-flip-g1i-zbook-ultra-14-g1a">HP</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">Asus</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Alienware</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">Razer</a>, and more. No other company seems to be as in demand. <em>– Emma Roth</em></p><p><h3>Most pointlessly expensive </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336375/sony-honda-afeela-ev-preorder-price-ces">Sony Honda Afeela</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Sony Honda Mobility CEO Yasuhide Mizuno during the company’s CES 2025 press conference.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I did a double-take when Sony Honda Mobility CEO Yasuhide Mizuno threw those numbers up on the big screen. I always assumed the Afeela was going to be expensive, but I didn’t expect it to be <em>that</em> expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>The top trim starting at $102,900 just feels egregious, especially when the upper tiers of the EV market feel completely saturated at the moment. Who is this even for? If you want a luxurious interior and great range, you’re better off with a Lucid Air. If you want an overdose of screens, get a Mercedes EQS. If you want incredible software, your best bet is Rivian. Need to feel like a plutocrat? Just get a BMW i7. I’m just saying, there are options! And all of the above are for sale in <em>all</em> 50 states, not just California, like the Afeela.&nbsp;</p><p>Could it become a more attractive option in the future? Sure. But if what we’re seeing today is a sign of more out-of-touch marketing to come, I’m not really Afeelin’ it. <em>– Andrew J. Hawkins</em></p><p><h3>Best thing we’ll probably buy from targeted Instagram ads</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7456910208825167146">Roam SodaTop</a></h4></p><p>The SodaTop is the kind of thing that feels like it should exist already, but it doesn’t as far as I can tell. It’s a simple sales pitch: a SodaStream for your Hydro Flask. And I think based on that pitch alone, you’ll know whether it’s for you. I’m a sparkling water addict, so it’s definitely for me. It’s simple enough: fill your bottle with cold water, put the SodaTop on top, and drop in a CO2 canister. You twist on a lid to puncture the seal and carbonate your water. Then you’re good to go.</p><p>You might be tempted to ask questions like, “Couldn’t you just make some fizzy water with a SodaStream and pour it into a Hydro Flask?” or “Can’t you just buy a bottle of sparkling water?” or “Is it really that portable?” To which I say, <em>shhhh</em>. The point here is that it’s a tidy solution and you don’t have to be <em>at home</em> to use it. If I still worked in an office, I’d keep one of these at my desk for sure. And I’ve already given up a lot of my kitchen counter space to beverage-making devices, so just using this at home would help me keep that space free. Honestly, it’s just a great, simple solution to the “sparkling water on the go” problem for those of us afflicted with sparkling water addiction. <em>– Allison Johnson</em></p><p><h3>Best beauty tech </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24334941/loreal-cell-bioprint-ces-2025-skincare-beauty-tech">L’Oreal Cell BioPrint</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>L’Oreal Cell BioPrint and an iPad showing its analysis.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>L’Oréal’s Cell BioPrint blew me away. The mini-lab analyzes photos of your skin and a skin sample from your cheeks to tell you about your skin’s health. It can tell you about your chronological age versus your biological one (aka is your current routine working well?). It can also assess how you’re doing with issues like wrinkles, skin tone, skin barrier, oiliness, and pore size — or if it’s likely to become a problem in the future. It can also analyze whether you’re responsive to certain ingredients, starting with retinol.</p><p>Skincare buying is a minefield. There are thousands of products touting this or that hero ingredient, all promising to fix any insecurity you might have with your complexion. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about skincare, and even I have a hard time figuring out what products I actually need in my routine. Something like this could help folks filter what’s worth trying and what’s just overconsumption. (And according to my results, I should probably start using retinol.) <em>–</em> <em>Victoria Song</em></p><p><h3>Best charger </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24334476/baseus-enercore-wall-charger-retractable-usb-c-primetrip-vr2-car-automotive">Baseus PrimeTrip VR2 Max car charger</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Baseus’ PrimeTrip VR2 Max car charger.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Baseus</cite></p></div><p>At home, you’ve probably got charging cables stashed all over the place, but inside your car is a different story. Baseus’ PrimeTrip VR2 Max solves that problem —&nbsp;and provides plenty of power to back it up.</p><p>The PrimeTrip VR2 Max car charger features two retractable USB-C charging cables, each measuring over 31 inches long, that will never go missing from your vehicle. It also offers an additional USB-C and USB-A port for connecting other cables, a total power output of 240W, and up to 105W of power delivery to a single USB-C port.</p><p>Assuming the retracting mechanism is durable enough to survive, for $44.99, the VR2 Max seems like a solid upgrade, even for a modern vehicle that already has charging ports. If work has you on the road a lot, there’s more than enough power to keep a beefy laptop charged. <em>– Andrew Liszewski</em></p><p><h3>Best new Dell computer name</h3></p><p><h4>There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement">no winners</a> because they all stink now.</h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Dell’s new product naming structure.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p><h3>Most no one asked for this</h3></p><p><h4>AI in TVs</h4></p><div><figcaption><em>The new AI button on LG’s 2025 TV remote.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>AI is worming its way into everything, and at CES this year, it crawled into TVs and remotes. Naturally, that includes new sets from LG and Samsung, which are deploying AI to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs">futz with your picture and sound settings</a> and let you talk to a chatbot or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336442/samsung-2025-tv-oled-mini-led-s95f-qn90f-features">analyze what’s on your screen</a>.

But Lenovo didn’t stop there — its sophomore effort is far more comfortable and affordable as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The grips are nicely sculpted, the trigger throw is adjustable, the battery’s slightly bigger, and it comes with an all-important variable refresh rate (VRR) screen at a more appropriate 1200p resolution for its mobile chip, both of which should mean smoother gameplay. Speaking of chips, some models will have a Lenovo-exclusive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor</a>, which, the company claims, helps it hit a lower price.&nbsp;</p><p>This May, gamers will have an intriguing choice: SteamOS for $499 or Windows for $599. <em>– Sean Hollister</em></p><p><h3>Best gaming </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">Nvidia RTX 50-series</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX 50-series cards.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Next-generation GPUs are finally here for fancy PC gaming rigs, and while AMD barely previewed its own RDNA 4 graphics cards, Nvidia went all out with its RTX 50-series. The flagship RTX 5090 will debut on January 30th priced at $1,999, giving you a two-slot card with 32GB of GDDR7 memory that Nvidia promises can double the frame rates in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> compared to the RTX 4090.&nbsp;</p><p>But if that’s too expensive for you — because, seriously, just look at that price tag —&nbsp;Nvidia is also promising major performance leaps lower in the line, saying <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">the new $549 RTX 5070 can keep up with an RTX 4090</a>, the previous generation’s $1,599 flagship. A lot of Nvidia’s performance claims rely on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 and a new Multi Frame Generation feature</a> that uses AI models to help multiply performance by generating even more frames to smooth out games, and Nvidia still has to prove that the RTX 50-series cards can deliver.</p><p>Still, I’m super excited about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-photos">how small the RTX 5090 is</a>, especially for small form factor PCs. If the RTX 50-series can live up to Nvidia’s promises, then this is going to be an impressive start to the next generation of GPUs. <em>–Tom Warren</em></p><p><h3>Best gadget that looks like a toaster, but you definitely should not put bread into</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337684/swippitt-phone-charging-system-ces-2025">Swippitt</a></h4></p><p>The phone toaster isn’t actually a toaster, but I can’t stop calling it that. It’s part of a system called Swippitt — and it’s the wackiest, cleverest charging gadget I’ve seen in a long time. The idea is that you put your phone in a Swippitt Link battery case, which has a 3,500mAh cell in the back. It boosts your phone’s charge, and when you need some more power, you insert the phone, case and all, into the Swippitt Hub — which is the toaster bit. In two seconds, it swaps the battery in your case for a fresh one, and you go on your way. There are five batteries at the ready in the hub, so anytime you need a top-off, you just drop in your phone. No more tethered charging or waiting.</p><p>I thought it was annoying until I grasped that last part. You don’t charge your phone, you just use this gadget to swap in a fresh booster battery, like, forever. No more charging (well, until you travel somewhere). It’s expensive as hell, though: $450 for the hub and $120 for each case. So it might make sense if you can get your whole family on board with it, or you just really, really hate charging your phone. But most of all, it’s a clever gadget that tries something different and doesn’t have a lot of other extra stuff you don’t need (looking at you, AI TVs). That’s the kind of CES gadget I love to see. <em>– Allison Johnson</em></p><p><h3>Best smart home device</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date">Switchbot K20 Plus Pro</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>Switchbot’s K20 Plus Pro with a security camera and air purifier slash wireless charging platform.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>This robot is ingenious, a bit ridiculous, and one of the wildest smart home inventions I’ve seen in a long time — which is what CES gadgets are all about.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date">Switchbot’s K20 Plus Pro</a> is a robot vacuum that can have different devices strapped to its head using the company’s modular “FusionPlatform.” As well as being able to deliver items around your home, it can have various SwitchBot products attached to it to perform tasks autonomously: purify your air, be a mobile home security camera, and carry your tablet around for you. They’ve even made an attachment to put a mini fridge on top. (So, yes, it can bring you a beer.)</p><p>What intrigues me the most here is that its FusionPlatform is completely open; you can plug any device into its various power ports and customize this robot to do what you need. That’s smart. <em>– Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</em></p><p><h3>Best use of E Ink </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24328013/pocketbook-e-ink-sharp-inkposter-electronic-paper-spectra-6">PocketBook InkPoster</a></h4></p><div><figcaption><em>The PocketBook InkPoster.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: PocketBook</cite></p></div><p>There weren’t many E Ink devices announced at CES this year, but that doesn’t mean PocketBook’s new InkPoster wins by default. It’s one of the first consumer devices to use E Ink’s advanced Spectra 6 color e-paper technology that can produce close to 60,000 colors. Compared to the limited capabilities of the color e-paper screens used in devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review">Kindle Colorsoft</a>, images and artwork on the InkPoster will look more like they’re painted on an actual canvas or printed on photo paper.</p><p>Companies like Samsung want you to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs">repurpose your living room TV</a> as a display for digital art, but the InkPoster could be a better alternative that’s easier on the eyes without a brightly backlit screen. It’s also completely wireless: it relies on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for uploading artwork and images and a rechargeable battery for power that only needs to be charged about once a year. If you’re indecisive about what to hang on your walls, the InkPoster won’t make you choose.&nbsp;– <em>Andrew Liszewski</em></p><p><h3>Best sequel<strong> </strong></h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338520/lg-stanbyme-2-portable-tv-carrying-strap-ces-2025">StanbyMe 2</a></h4></p><p>I’m really happy LG isn’t giving up on its quest to make a useful, quirky portable TV with its StanbyMe series. It’s a ridiculous name no doubt, but the new StanbyMe 2 is an update that deserves our entirely legitimate Best Sequel award. Instead of the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23554060/lg-stanbyme-monitor-tv-stand-features-specs-review">fixed TV on a lamp post</a>” design of the original model, it now lets you clutch a 27-inch screen under your arm like some super iPad Pro or attach a strap to hold it like a purse. It’s also technically a sequel to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24109258/lg-stanbyme-go-portable-suitcase-briefcase-tv-review">secret agent-style StanbyMe Go</a> but now lighter and with better battery life.</p><p>Although I haven’t carried one myself yet, I’d imagine it would be a lot like clutching an Apple Studio Display or classic 27-inch iMac with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989517/apple-store-studio-display-interchangeable-stand-replacement-repair-service">their stands removed</a>. (I’ve carried many in my line of work.) The StanbyMe 2 would be great as a portable monitor for video games, a laptop, or Mac Mini, especially with the now-more-usable 2560 x 1440 resolution compared to the previous model’s 1080p. I was on the fence about buying LG’s previous iterations of this product, but I’m ready to strap this one on as soon as I can. <em>– Umar Shakir</em></p><p><h3>Best concept </h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools">Dreame concept robovac</a></h4></p><p>It finally happened. Robot vacuums have limbs. Roborock and Dreame both showed off vacuums with appendages at CES 2025: Roborock debuted its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24332998/roborock-saros-z70-robot-vacuum-omnigrip-arm">Saros Z70</a> with an arm to pick up socks, and Dreame added legs to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337114/dreame-x50-ultra-robot-vacuum-climb-steps-legs-price-ces">X50 Ultra</a> to climb a small step. But it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools">Dreame’s concept bot</a> that put the pieces together.&nbsp;</p><p>The company’s next innovation is a robot that features legs <em>and</em> an arm. It also has a separate toolbox, and the company says the robot will be able to select various brushes from it and attach them to its arm to get into your dusty corners. </p><p>I love the innovation we’re seeing as robot vacuums seek to clean every inch of your home, but am I also slightly terrified? Yes. Yes, I am.&nbsp; <em>– Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</em></p><p><h3>Best in show</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs">Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a></h4></p><p>There was really only one gadget at CES that everyone had to see, and that’s Lenovo’s rollable laptop, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a>. Yes, we may have first seen it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/26/23615842/lenovo-rollable-laptop-smartphone-prototype-concept">in concept form</a> a while back, but this is now a real product you’ll be able to see in a store and buy this year. The only thing better than a wild proof-of-concept at a show like CES is when a wild future-tech idea becomes our reality in the present.</p><p>Now, it’ll cost $3,499 when it launches in June, so it’s not likely many people will buy it. But picture this future: you sit down to do some work, you open up your laptop with a nice-looking OLED display, and then you hit a button to summon <em>more</em> <em>laptop</em> — as the kinda-square-ish 14-inch display climbs higher into a 16.7-inch tall boy of a screen. That’s not something that happens in the real world, but it will once this laptop comes out.</p><p>And of course, the tech has many caveats and drawbacks to go with it: it’s expensive, it’s potentially fragile, there’s bound to be software jank with Windows, and just look at those creases. But it’s also got the upside of being, well, <em>cool</em>. – <em>Antonio G. Di Benedetto</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Popular mods include turning Iron Man into Vegeta from Dragon Ball and Mantis into a goth. There’s even a mod that turns Jeff the Land Shark into Pochita from Chainsaw Man.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/mr-1736510188657.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Vegeta as Iron Man mod for Marvel Rivals has been downloaded over 60,000 times.

Despite the risk of getting banned, Marvel Rivals mods remain hugely popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now. Players are reporting the Season 1 update has added asset hash checking, which in turn has disabled mods. The official Marvel Rivals Discord is starting to fill up with questions from bemused players who are asking why their mods aren’t working, and social media is now bubbling up the explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase told IGN: "It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have suggested mod makers may be able to issue workarounds for their creations, but as it stands Marvel Rivals is a mod-free game. And the crackdown perhaps comes as little surprise. NetEase generates revenue from the free-to-play hero shooter through the sale of premium skins. If modding threatens that revenue in any way, NetEase will have taken a dim view.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve seen a similar crackdown from other developers who sell premium skins for their games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-bans-mods-from-public-servers-says-official-mod-tools-are-coming">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment at one point disabled mods for the game</a>, although later reversed its decision.

<p>Nintendo has finally acknowledged the slew of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks that have been hitting the internet.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s acknowledgment came following this week’s CES event in Las Vegas, where accessory manufacturer Genki revealed Nintendo’s Switch 2 models. Genki has revealed since the leaks that the images were created based on leaked information and not on seeing Switch 2.</p>



<p>However, the leaks have seemingly struck a nerve with Nintendo, who have acknowledged them in a rare occurrence. Speaking with Japanese website <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>, Nintendo said that “these images and videos are not official.”</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, however, has quickly become one of the biggest open secrets in the entire industry, with almost everything to do with the console, including accessories, logos, specifications, and more leaking online.</p>



<p>As for when Nintendo will reveal the Nintendo Switch 2, it remains to be seen, but the sheer amount of leaks surrounding the console should indicate that it will be sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Regardless of its reveal and impending release, Nintendo will be hoping that the Switch’s successor is as successful as the original, which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In comparison to other Nintendo consoles, the Wii U has sold 13.56 million units, the Wii has sold 101.63 million units, the DS with 154.02 million, the Game Boy Advance has sold 81.51 million units, the Game Boy has sold 118.69 million units, the GameCube sold 21.74 million units, Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million units, the SNES sold 49.10 million units and the NES sold 61.91 million units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/songs-of-silence-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence - Story Trailer | OUT NOW! | Art Nouveau-inspired Fantasy Strategy Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5TFGFsCR60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Songs of Silence initially offers a series of Campaign missions that explore the conflict between Primordials and Celestials, with humanity caught between the two. These two forces pulled the world apart, leaving one of light and one of darkness, and while this initially led to a period of peace and enlightenment, it soon dissolved into bitter war. Humanity thought itself blessed by the Celestials, but now, under the incoming pestilence of Silence, the remaining humans struggle to survive.</p>


<p>You take on the role of Lorelai, the newly crowned queen of Ehrengard. Her kingdom has already fallen to Silence, and she traipses across the land with her remaining subjects in search of a new home. It’s not easily won though, and instead all she finds is more conflict and in-fighting between the nobles of the neighbouring kingdoms, before she then suffers a bitter betrayal.</p>
<p>It sets the scene for an intriguing fantasy tale, and one that doesn’t simply go for a gung-ho, binary vision of good and evil. It instead gives you a measured, often brutal depiction of war, and those who are worst affected by it. It’s then dressed up with excellent voice work and some of the most impressive character art you’ve ever seen in gaming, making it a genuine pleasure to take in.</p>


<p>Things start out in familiar fashion for the turn-based 4X genre. You move across the over-world map with a limited movement range, and you can enter into combat with any enemies within that. Once combat begins though, you soon discover that Songs of Silence is doing things differently. Battles are fundamentally skirmishes, with your army limited to a set number of units, though these can be buffed up by militia and other reserve units if you’re garrisoned in a location.</p>
<p>You choose your army’s starting positioning, but once you enter combat you don’t have direct control over the majority of your units, each one automatically attacking the nearest enemy in the vein of an auto-battler. What you do have is your deck of actions, with each of your army’s commanders having their own selection of cards to choose from. Each card provides a special ability or attack to help you on the way to victory. Initially, that’s a charge command, sending your mounted units plunging into the enemy ranks, while later cards see you calling winged creatures from the sky down upon them, or causing units to explode upon death.</p>

<p>While your units remain at the same level – it’s a shame not to be able to level up those who’ve been with you through many battles – each commander gains XP and levels up, growing your army and giving you a selection of new cards or the chance to upgrade an existing one. It means that your commander steadily grows in your chosen direction, letting you customise and tailor the abilities and attacks you prefer.</p>
<p>At first, it feels as though battles are short and easily won, but you soon discover that it’s crucial to choose the correct units, and that you’re not woefully underprepared, as Songs of Silence will merrily knock you on your beautifully drawn ass time and time again. You can exchange units between your commanders, and at times you need to make a last-ditch attempt at success by pooling your remaining units together for one final battle.</p>
<p>Songs of Silence makes battles feel hard-won, even though you don’t have full control of your army. You’ll still be there, nervously glancing at your ability cooldowns while trying to protect or resurrect a crucial unit in time. It feels rewarding and focussed, and I love that it’s doing things differently. It’s a real success.</p>
<p>Where Songs of Silence occasionally falls down is the way you select and interact with your units, and on console I was forever selecting the wrong thing, or accidentally moving a unit when I meant to choose another one. I had to tell myself which button to press consciously, and it creates a disconnect between you and the game. It could, of course, just be a personal fumble, but there’s something just that little bit off to the way it fits together here. I’d occasionally move a unit into the safety of a city, only to accidentally move them out again, using up the last of my movement, and stranding them in front of some incoming enemy units. Fortunately, it never ruined my chances, but it is an unnecessary frustration.</p>

<p>The Campaign can also fall into the trap of relying on pure power, and the way you acquire that is through repeated grinding and capturing enough locations to ensure you’ve got a steady stream of resources. It’s little different from how other strategy games function, but sometimes it feels more drawn out than it should be.</p>
<p>This is where Skirmishes come in. These battles allow you to generate random maps and go up against up to five AI-controlled enemies with a series of Fates that alter the gameplay in some way. At first, there won’t be a great deal here, but as you complete Campaign missions you unlock new characters, and additional Fates to switch things up. It’s a never-ending supply of action, and the underlying mechanics shine through when divorced from any narrative drive. Multiplayer against human opponents is identical, though I should note that there aren’t a whole lot of people playing online these days. You can offset that by joining the game’s Discord and finding like-minded players, which is what Songs of Silence points you to do. It’s well worth the extra effort.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a wonderful additional layer alongside the artistic visual flair, which is little surprise when it comes from Hitoshi Sakimoto, composer of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy 12 and one of my personal favourites, Valkyria Chronicles. It brings drama and emotion to every encounter, with sweeping orchestral moments ensuring that you’re uplifted at just the right time, before plunging into the darkness and danger that lurks at various points.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-support-some-sort-of-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-may-be-scaled-down-from-xbox-series-s-versions.1078884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could support more than regular NVIDIA DLSS, as a recently filed patent outlines some brand-new tech that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">Digital Foundry</a> went through the 39 pages of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">patent</a> filed on December 31st, 2024, highlighting some interesting findings that go beyond the description of a standard NVIDIA DLSS-style upscaling. One of the most interesting findings is the confirmation that the upscaling method described in the patent, which is usually expensive in terms of compute power and bandwidth, is specifically targeted to be executed within the 120th or 160th of a second on a low-power chip, so it's most definitely not the usual DLSS seen in the PC desktop space.</p>
<p>Another equally interesting finding discovered in the Nintendo Switch 2 AI-upscaling patent is the description of something that could be labeled as dynamic AI-upscaling. According to this description, the model based upon real-time data coming from the game engine can be switched out in real-time or prepared ahead of time programmatically to use lower quality upscaling<br>
to fit within a certain frame time budget. Essentially, if the game is sending out an image that exceeds 16.6 milliseconds or 33.3 milliseconds, the device will use a lower-quality upscaling model to output the final 1080p image. This is obviously new tech that was never seen before in action and that may have been developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2, as something like this may not be needed in the PC desktop space unless for very low-power laptops, for example.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 patent is very broad, and describes all sorts of applications for AI-powered upscaling, such as neural decompression that could be used to bring file sizes down, and even cloud upscaling, going over various possibilities such as upscaling being done on the cloud and then sent via a stream to a local device, the upscaling getting done on the local device and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo's Switch 2 Upscaling Patent Explained: More Than Just DLSS?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4R1p1LjHME8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While AI-powered upscaling can do wonders, as shown over the past few years by NVIDIA DLSS, developers still need to get their games running decently on the Nintendo Switch 2, which could be a challenge considering the system won't be as powerful as any of the other current generation systems. According to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-and-speculation-ot-cmon-nintendo-announce-this-thing-already-up-dev-unit-leaked-partly-see-threadmarks.1077882/page-23#post-134076051">rumors</a> circulating online, there is a "movement" to try and get scaled-down Xbox Series S versions of games on the system, although it is not yet known if this has been successful so far, and with leaks having focused only on the hardware side of things, we will likely have to wait for the official reveal to see how multiplatform games will run on the system.</p>
<p>Speaking about leaks, Nintendo has finally acknowledged them in some way.&nbsp;<span>In a statement issued to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, the company said that the images and videos making the rounds are "not official."</span>&nbsp;What's interesting to note is that the company didn't say they are not accurate, so there's a solid chance we already got the first look at the system via all these leaks that have come in daily.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but at this point, it should only be a matter of days until we finally see what the Japanese company has in store for the future.</p>

            <p>As a few of you might know, each Sunday at 4pm GMT I run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">Booked For The Week</a> - a regular chat with a selection of cool industry folks about what they're reading, what they're hoping to read next, and what books they recommend. The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-nightingale-absolver-and-total-war-warhammer-writer-dan-griliopoulos"> was Dan Griliopoulos</a>, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-deus-ex-looking-glass-studios-and-othersides-warren-spector">was Warren Spector back in November</a>, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Hey, so if you recall I reserved the right to change my mind about anything on my “what I’m going to read next” list for your Bookshelf column," Spector emailed me last night. "Well I changed my mind completely and thought it might be fun and interesting to do an update. Feel free to ignore this, but here’s what I was thinking."</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm not going to ignore Warren Spector. I figured an update to the original post would just get buried, so here it is in full. "Is this just promotion for your bloody column, Nic?", you may ask. Au contraire, my little faithless banana bread tin. Is it promotion for <em>literature itself</em>. Cheers again to Warren.</p>
<blockquote><p>So in my recent entry in this website’s Bookshelves column I listed a bunch of books I was considering reading next. I did the logical thing and listed the books that were next to my reading chair or at the top of my Kindle library, but I reserved the right to change my mind. Good thing I did because, boy, did I change my mind!</p>
<p>I've done some interesting reading recently that I wanted to share. None of which had <em>anything</em> to do with the books I thought I was going to read. I’m not talking about <em>a</em> book, but several unrelated books that turned <em>out</em> to be related and are richer when read together than when read separately. All are exceptionally well-written. I strongly recommend each of them, but especially if you read all of them back-to-back. That’s a genuinely special experience. Or was for me anyway.</p>
<p>First, New York In The Fifties by Dan Wakefield. It's a history of the intellectual and creative history of the city from the late-Forties through the early-Sixties, mostly around Columbia University and Greenwich Village (West and East). The author was like the Zelig character in Woody Allen's movie. He knew the Columbia intellectuals, the Esquire and New Yorker writers, the Village Voice founders, the Beats, a ton of musicians, people caught up in the blacklist, C. Wright Mills, Norman Mailer, Jack Kerouac, Thomas Pynchon, Bob Dylan and more.</p>
<p>But then there's book number 2 -- Three Shades Of Blue by James Kaplan. It's the story of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans (with lots about Charlie Parker, too) during the SAME PERIOD in the Village and mid-town (the jazz center of NYC). You get a completely different perspective on those years. It's fascinating. The author talks about specific songs and albums, all of which are streamable. I listened to the music he was talking about as I was reading, which enriched the experience greatly.</p>
<p>And THEN there's Positively 4th Street by David Hajdu, the story of the folk scene IN THE SAME PERIOD, also in the Village. It's mostly about Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Richard and Mimi Farina. Again, a different perspective on the period.</p>
<p>Next, I'm going to read a book called The Slip by Prudence Peiffer, about the art scene in the same place, same time. I anticipate that being fascinating for its perspective, too.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things I learned is that ALL of these people hung out at a bar called The White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village -- ALL OF 'EM. Oh, to have been a fly on the wall!</p>
<p>Even if you're not interested in the time, place, or (seriously) the subject matter, the ways in which the books dovetail with one another makes for a fascinating reading journey. And you might just find yourself becoming interested in things you weren't interested in before.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am very happy to work at this website for many reasons, but high among them is game developers emailing me out of the blue at 8pm to passionately talk about the books they've read so I can share it to an audience of people that I'm 96% sure will mostly definitely give a shit. It makes me want to stay curious and excited and I hope you feel the same. Thank you again to Warren, and thank you to everyone who continues to read and comment on the column every week. As much as I'm always excited to speak to a new guest, some of my favourite times have been when I haven't been able to find anyone, but you've all still kept the conversation going with some great recommendations and thoughts. It feels like a very special and rare thing for a PC Gaming site and I plan to keep it going as long as possible.</p>
<p>Also, if you're a developer with a book habit please get in contact. I need new guests for the slate and I'm very lazy.</p>
<p>If you missed it, Spector is making a new immersive sim called Thick As Thieves with Greg LoPiccolo and David McDonough. They <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warren-spector-and-thiefs-game-director-are-making-a-multiplayer-immersive-sim-called-thick-as-thieves">recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for RPS</a> about the project.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Oh, and one last thing..." teased the narration for yesterday's <a href="https://youtu.be/viAEO_cMqfU">Like A Dragon Direct</a> showcase on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, before announcing that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be getting New Game+ mode as part of a free post-launch update. It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Infinite Wealth</a> catching some backlash for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-seemingly-locks-new-game-behind-expensive-special-editions">decision to lock the mode</a> behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.</p>
<p>Unrelated, but I've decided to stop putting angry spiders through your letterbox every morning. I know, I know. Come on now. Hero is such a strong word.</p>

<p>The very talented scallywags at RGG also showed off some more of Majima's escapades, including his 'Mad Dog' and 'Sea Dog' fighting styles, making every pirate pun imaginable in the process. I mean, you'd have to. There will of course be ship customisation and crew gathering, and I especially like the look of 'Madlantis' - a seedy den of swashbucklers stuffed with minigames. Naturally, a lot of the other environments will be familiar to anyone who explored Infinite Wealth's Hawaii. I know I'm not alone in admiring RGG's approach to asset and location reuse, freeing them up to focus on quirkier additions, and also letting you get familiar with their virtual cities over the course of several games.</p><p>I was not personally affected by the decision to charge for New Game+ last time around, because the last thing I felt like doing after finishing 70 hours of Infinite Wealth was immediately playing another 70. Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Gaiden</a> entry, so it'll run shorter than the full-fat games - supposedly around 15 hours or so. I still thought it was a stinky choice, mind. Aside from new difficulty levels that effectively just made numbers go up, it was unambitious and uninteresting as far as NG+ modes go - 'unambitious' and 'uninteresting' being two words I usually wouldn't associate with the series at all. This one's out on the 21st of February.</p></div>

            <p>You will very soon be able to register to take part in the network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s upcoming co-op spin-off, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Those who are keen to participate in the test can register from this afternoon at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>The test itself is scheduled for 14th to 17th February, and will run in three hour blocks. On the 14th (so, Valentine's Day, and really, what is more romantic than Elden Ring?), the session will run between 11am and 2pm UK time. On the 15th, there will be two sessions. The first will run from 3am until 6am, the second will run between 7pm and 10pm. The session on the 16th will run between 11am and 2pm once again, and the final session on 17th will run from 3am until 6am.</p>

<p>Nightreign's test will be available across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, although the developer notes the full game will also be available to those on PC via Steam, as well as Xbox One and PS4 consoles.</p>
<p>"The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch," reads the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test">information page for Nightreign's network test</a> (where I also presume a link for registration will also be made available). </p>

<p>Alongside a definition of what it deems to be harassment, the company said it reserves the right to cease providing support services or products, and to protect employees through legal action or criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The policy does not specify examples of this harassment, though it's clearly been put in place as the result of such behaviour.</p>
<p>In particular, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> fandom is notorious for divided opinions on Aerith and Tifa and their relationships with Cloud.</p>
<p>"I say this with love: FF7 shippers need to touch noses," said Aerith voice actor Briana White back in December. "We're all the same family in loving these characters so relax."</p>

<p>Last January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-shippers-ruin-great-story-development-with-overt-sexualisation-says-cloud-voice-artist">Cloud voice actor Cody Christian</a> said shippers "ruin great story development" with overt sexualisation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has addressed abuse against the game's developers on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Back in January 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-naoki-yoshida-addresses-verbal-abuse-from-players">Yoshida addressed abuse aimed at developers</a>. "I mean, I can take it, even though it doesn't make it less bad, but staff members will feel really down after getting those words when they gave their absolute best into trying to create something where everyone can enjoy, and this may end up making them no longer create things that are fun from there on," he said.</p>
<p>Then last year, following the release of latest expansion Dawntrail, he commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/transphobic-abuse-sent-to-final-fantasy-14s-wuk-lamat-voice-actor-breaks-my-heart-says-naoki-yoshida">transphobic abuse sent to Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all," said Yoshida. "It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>While Square Enix should be commended for protecting its staff, it's sad that fan behaviour makes such a policy necessary.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Donnie Yen has taken to an interview with Polygon to confirm that the Sleeping Dogs movie that was announced in 2017 is officially dead in the water. Sleeping Dogs was released in 2012 as a spiritual successor to the True Crime games, and it allowed players to explore an open-world rendition of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>The game was universally praised and highly enjoyable, scoring great reviews before being ultimately overshadowed by GTA 5 just one year later. In the recent interview, Donnie Yen, who was set to star as protagonist Wei Shen, confirmed that it’s ‘an unfortunate thing’ that the project has failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sleeping-dogs-lie">Sleeping Dogs Lie</h2>



<p>In the interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Donnie Yen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights.</p>



<p>I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>



<p>Well, on to better things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since being ‘announced’ in 2017, almost nothing was mentioned about the live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs. It comes as a surprise that it was canned, and it’s likely someone, somewhere is kicking themselves. Right now, live-action representations of video games are going like gangbusters, soaring up the charts and winning awards worldwide.</p>



<p>The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us are testaments to that fact.</p>



<p>When the news dropped that Donnie Yen would be serving as the frontman in Sleeping Dogs, fans everywhere were slightly confused. After all, Wei Shen was originally played by Will Yun Lee, who served as the voice, face, and motion capture artist for the character – and Lee is also a renowned actor.</p>



<p>Regardless of those creative decisions, the Sleeping Dogs movie will never see the light of day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-signals-single-player-only-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-on-pc-requires-a-psn-account-3-months-ahead-of-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has signalled that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> on PC requires a PSN account three months before the game’s release on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, the Steam page for Naughty Dog’s single-player adventure includes the now-standard Sony requirement for a PlayStation Network account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers had little hope that Sony would budge on the PSN requirement for its Steam releases, and so it has proved with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. As a result, PC gamers in over 100 countries won’t be able to buy the game on Steam because Sony does not operate PlayStation accounts in those markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PSN is available in just 73 countries, leaving many out in the cold. The Baltics, including states that are part of the European Union (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), and the vast majority of countries in Africa are also excluded. For years, some players in these countries have created a PSN in a supported region to get around the restrictions, but there are concerns that Sony could ban the accounts of those who do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PC push has been controversial to say the least, with most of its games suffering negative Steam reviews as a result of the PSN requirement regardless of whether the games themselves are great or run well. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement"><u>God of War Ragnarök</u> met with a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam following its PC launch</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around the PSN requirement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-mod-removes-controversial-psn-requirement-and-its-creator-has-vowed-to-maintain-it">One disgruntled fan even created a <u>God of War Ragnarök</u> mod that removed the requirement</a>, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-says-creator-of-god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-bypass-mod-has-pulled-it-offline">it was pulled down out of fear of reprisal from Sony</a>. Exacerbating the backlash is that Sony has doubled down on this policy even for single-player games, such as God of War Ragnarök, Until Dawn, and now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier in 2024. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it announced the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2, Sony said it had to do with player security. “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games,” Sony said in a statement issued at the time. “This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony added: “We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of. “Many thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered likely faces a similar backlash on launch that Sony’s other PC games have seen, despite the Steam warning months in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-naval-combat-looks-even-better-than-skull-and-bones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Direct</a>, the Japanese developer shared a lot of new info on their next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-new-trailer-shows-more-of-goro-majimas-new-pirate-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, which is slated to launch next month. The 13-minute video demonstrated ground combat, but its highlight was certainly naval combat, which fans have commented looks even better than Ubisoft's naval-only title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skull and Bones</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you agree or not, naval combat in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii certainly sounds quite deep. To begin with, players will get to fully customize the Goromaru pirate ship, including hull, armor, sails, and figurehead. The game also lets them hire their crew among a roster of over a hundred sailors, who have their own attributes and can subsequently be improved by deepening the crew's bonds through song, drink, adventure, and victory. They will then have to be optimally assigned to attack or defense operations.</p>
<p>Of course, a key component of naval combat is installing, upgrading, and firing cannons. This is where the IP's outlandish nature shines, offering options for energy cannons, laser cannons, and even 'shark cannons'. Of course, boarding is also available in the game, allowing the crews to come to blows in frenetic melee combat. Before the end of the video, the developers also confirmed that the New Game Plus mode will be added to the game for free after launch.</p>

<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off set after the events narrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. Series mainstay Goro Majima is the lead character. At the start of the story, he washes on Rich Island with no recollection of his previous life.</p>
<p>The game is scheduled to be released on February 21 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here's one. You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">Video Games Chronicle</a><a></a>, and sure enough, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam page</a> for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The requirement for a PSN account to play certain games on PC became controversial after Sony tried to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">push the requirement</a> on players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, who were so miffed they review-bombed the game on Steam. In that case, the decision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">was overturned</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, Sony has applied the mandatory account linking in an irregular way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">didn't require it</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God Of War Ragnarock</a> did. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> didn't make it mandatory, but tried to sweeten the deal by giving players bonus cosmetics for linking their Steam and PSN accounts. Now it looks like Sony are confident <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II Remastered</a> is big enough to cause only annoyed tuts when it comes to this requirement. </p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons this mandatory account smooshing annoys folks is that it means the game will not go on sale in certain countries where PSN doesn't operate for legal or business reasons. Insider Gaming have compiled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/">a list of countries</a> which don't have PSN. In Europe alone this list includes Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Moldova, Georgia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you live in any of these PSNless places, you basically can't play the affected game. This is despite the fact that many of these games are entirely single player. </p><p>As for the reasons behind it, well. Sony's chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki recently spoke about the requirement in an investor call, and said the account linking was done "so that anybody can enjoy the game safely" (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/sony-not-giving-up-on-its-psn-requirement-on-pc">as reported by VG247</a>). But this hardly explains it. The more likely reasoning comes down to digital rights management - they want players to be online so they can check if the game is a legal copy. And this has become such a dogmatic part of their legal and technical process that it now requires cutting off entire markets. It seems a stupid strategy to exclude entire countries of possible sales just to enforce a DRM policy, but corporations are cash-huffing monsters, and do not necessarily value the sales numbers - projected or real - in some nations. </p>
<p>All in all, another example of corporate interest making things worse for everyone, thanks to the arcane legalities and unseeable arithmetic of business. For more lumps of news, please keep reading our website. I promise some of the lumps are actually good. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-10-to-6.1078827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s top ten time… kind of. We’ve got one final group of five, from ten down to six in our list, before we break things out and tackle the final bunch individually. But what games are going to be in this little group? Well, there’s a AAA selection here (if only through alliteration), and potentially a “quadruple-A” game that actually means it. But first, in at number 10…</p>
<h2>10 – Citizen Sleeper 2 Starward Vector</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 31st January 2025</em></p>
<p>Sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">one of the most acclaimed indie games of 2022</a>, Citizen Sleeper 2 looks to take the same approach to its tabletop RPG narrative stylings, giving you a set of tools with which to navigate its rich narrative. There’s an overhauled dice system, new skills and, most significantly, a ship and a crew that you can customise for each Cycle as you take on jobs within the star system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DdETwG_eyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Still set in the Helion system, Citizen Sleeper 2 lets you hop into your ship, recruit a crew of characters to go with you and head out to explore the Belt, do jobs and get paid. You’re trying to escape your past, in which you fell under the control of a local criminal gang, rewriting your body’s code to do so, but introducing malfunctions to your system and having to run with a price on your head and no memories.</p>

<h2>9 – Avowed</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 18th February 2025</em></p>
<p>Will you save the world or doom it? That’s the choice that runs through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, as you gain more and more power on your journey as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, tasked with investigating a spiritual plague that threatens the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avowed takes us back to the Living Lands, a mysterious islands in the fantasy world of Eora, which it shares with Obsidian’s previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">Pillars of Eternity</a> games. However, where those games were both top-down CRPGs and part of the genre’s revival over the past decade, Avowed is shifting back to one of Obsidian’s areas of expertise: first person action RPG adventuring. Avowed is not a fully open world game, but has several large open areas that you can explore and, in that regard, it might be comparable to one of Obsidian’s other acclaimed hits, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p>
<p>Originally set for release at the end of 2024, Xbox decided to hold off on Avowed’s launch in a busy release window to try and find a little bit of breathing room in early 2025. That…. hasn’t necessarily worked out, but with more time to polish and the promise of a first party Xbox game, this is certainly one to watch.</p>
<h2>8 – Atomfall</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Oh sure, Chornobyl and Three Mile might the most infamous nuclear plant accidents in history, but we can do good old fashioned meltdown with the best of them in old Blighty. OK, so the Windscale Fire wasn’t a meltdown, but as it burned for several days, sprinkled nuclear material across the UK and to the continent, and was part of a government cover up, it’s pretty up there.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what were they covering up, <em>really</em>? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> spins us off into an alternate version of events where the surrounding area was rapidly locked down, the locals kept in line and monitored by the military group Protocol, and advanced retro-futuristic technology the order of the day. Can you unpick the mystery?</p>
<p>It might look like a very English Fallout, but this is a rather different style of game, where scarcity of resources plays a big factor in pushing you to melee – you get to fight roving bands of bandits dressed like Morris dancers – and investigating the story will be a bigger part of the experience.</p>
<h2>7 – Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">20th March 2025</a></em></p>
<p>Fans have been demanding an Assassin’s Creed set in Japan pretty much since 2007, and they’re finally going to get what they want with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> – even if it’s been embroiled in a disappointingly inevitable amount of internet discourse, thanks in no small part to featuring a black immigrant samurai as one of the two playable characters. That’s something that Ubisoft has at times struggled to communicate well with fans and gamers around the world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga. The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those persky Templars. Their stories will be intertwined, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<h2>6 – GTA 6</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Late 2025</em></p>
<p>It might almost seem sacrilegious for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> not to be topping our most wanted chart, and yet here we are. We’ve no doubt that, for the global gaming population, GTA 6 is set to be another defining cultural event, much like GTA 5 was back in 2013, but it’s not quite got our juices flowing the same way as the games that have made it into the top 5. Still, we’re as keen as anyone to see that second trailer…</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story, featuring Lucia as the first female protagonist in the series, getting out of prison at the start of the game after a bit of “bad luck”. Revisiting Vice City, this is a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, deeply influenced by the&nbsp;breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular.</p>
<p>Take Two has targeted the back end of 2025 for release, though given the scale and ambition of these games, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this slip to early 2026, sneaking into the same financial year.</p>
<p><em>We’ve rattled through out Most Wanted 2025 lists so far, but it’s time for a little break, I think. We’ll see you on Monday for #5 and round this out through next week.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense.1078824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese corporation Tencent has <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will fight its inclusion in the list of Chinese military companies <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided by the US Department of Defense</a>. Earlier this week, the news caused a significant drop (around 10%) in the company's stock.</p>
<p>Tencent is seeking a negotiation with the US Department of Defense but may also initiate a lawsuit if it cannot reach an agreement. Here's the full official statement:</p>
<p><em>As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the CMC List is a mistake. Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group.</em></p>
<p><em>The CMC List is also distinct from the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List (NS-CMIC List) maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company.</em></p>
<p><em>The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake. During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List.</em></p>
<p>Tencent offers various online products and services in China, like the messaging apps Tencent QQ and WeChat, though it is perhaps best known in the Western world for its gaming division. For a while now, it's been the largest gaming publisher in the world by revenue, well ahead of Sony and Microsoft, although the latter has reduced the gap following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There has been a flurry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>-related news in recent days, but not from Nintendo itself. Now, the Mario maker has broken its silence on the week's reports.</p>
<p>During this week's CES trades show in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">reportedly-accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps Switch 2 were shown off</a> by accessories manufacturer Genki. Several images and videos of this model were subsequently shared across social media (as you can see below). It is worth noting that Genki has since said <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">its model was created based only on leaked information from the industry</a>, and it has not actually seen a Switch 2 console. </p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a statement to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, telling the world that those images and videos making the rounds are "not official".</p>

</figure>
<p>Here's the very to the point, translated statement from the article: "The images and videos, they are not official."</p>
<p>While this statement is fairly innocuous in a lot of ways, and not exactly surprising given we already knew it was not Nintendo itself showcasing the hardware, this marks the first acknowledgement by the company that these leaks are even happening at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has not actually said anything about the accuracy of the third-party Switch 2 model which has been shown.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>In addition to that mock Switch 2 model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">yesterday we had some further console leaks</a>. Purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards started showing up. Meanwhile, another report suggested Nintendo's upcoming console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock. There were also some new murmurings over the Switch 2's optical sensor.</p><p>Nintendo will be sharing something official on its Switch successor soon enough, though. It previously confirmed we would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">receive a proper announcement before the close of the fiscal year</a>, which ends 31st March. What we do know for sure is that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bald headed assassin simulator Hitman: World of Assassination has amassed an impressive body count of 75 million players.
</p>
<p>
World of Assassination was originally launched in 2021 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S under the name of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and was then retitled two years later when content from the trilogy's other games was added in. 
</p>
<p>
Today, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is celebrating the game's continued success. A million players logged on in December alone, the studio said, lured in by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">fresh mission starring 90s action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>.

<p>
Many of those players will likely be people sampling the game via its Free Starter Pack option, which also currently lets you take down Van Damme as one of the game's limited-time Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, IO says that only 40 percent of players who attempted to take down Van Damme have been successful at doing so. (The developer tracked the longest successful attempt at seven hours, with the shortest just 21 seconds.)
</p>
<p>
Van Damme disappears from the game as an Elusive Target at the end of this weekend, on Sunday 12th January, but you can buy permanent access to a mission featuring the star in a £4 DLC mission pack.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, IO says it is working on more content for Hitman to release later this year - though there's no details yet on what. 
</p>
<p>
IO is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">its under-wraps James Bond 007 game</a> and a mysterious fantasy game project. Additionally, the company is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">handling publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the AAA game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> film adaptation, set to star Star Wars actor Donnie Yen, has been canned.</p>
<p>That's according to Yen himself, who confirmed the cancellation to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," he said. "I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>"Well, on to better things."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but little has been heard since and no release date was given, so it's not particularly surprising to discover its cancellation.</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs was a 2012-released open world game published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, which was something of a GTA-style game set in Hong Kong but with martial arts combat and parkour.</p>
<p>Though received well by critics, it criminally remains a cult classic.</p>
<p>Still, a film starring and directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Yen would've been a natural fit. And the live-action reveal trailer above certainly hints at what we're missing.</p>
<p>Plenty of other film adaptations have been revealed recently. Sony confirmed earlier this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers will be adapted to film</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima is also set to be adapted to an anime series</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-pc-require-psn-account/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-part-ii-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account.1078800/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-pc-require-psn-account/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, scheduled to be released on PC in April, will require a PSN account to function, despite having no online features. This follows the trend established by many PlayStation-centric games that found their way to PC platforms in the last year or so, but it doesn’t make it any less irritating for players.</p>



<p>This disruptive inclusion means that The Last of Us Part II on PC won’t launch in the several countries where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is one of the chief issues at play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backlash-continued">Backlash Continued</h2>



<p>Last year, a sudden change brought this requirement into the Helldivers 2 universe, with players being prompted to link a PSN account to continue playing the game. It caused a monumental downfall for the game, with tens of thousands of negative reviews being cast against the title.</p>



<p>That situation was rectified, but Sony would go on to make it a base requirement for further ports, such as God of War Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> discovered the requirement after wishlists went live. The Last of Us Part II Remastered will hit PC platforms – such as Steam and Epic Games Stores – on April 3. Instead of a Last of Us Part III, players are once again being forced to satisfy themselves with the iterations that have been re-released so many times over the years.</p>



<p>The game will arrive just as the second season of the popular HBO live-action adaption is set to drop. It was recently confirmed – along with a new trailer – that The Last of Us season two will hit screens worldwide in April. While a date wasn’t stressed, it’s expected to coincide with the PC release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p>Tactics.</p>



<p>Do you see the PSN linking requirement as being a major issue, or are you not bothered? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
