<p>Yep, with the Switch 2 game introducing a whole swathe of Kirby characters to the racer, to make things "fair", now Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Cappy — among many others — will be able to inhale enemies on the course and take their powers.</p>
<p>In Kirby Air Riders, Copy Abilities can be used offensively or to boost your speed. So far, we've seen Fire, Sword, Bomb, Wheel, Mike, Cutter, Jet, Steel Ball, and Plasma, and we're sure many more will be shown off as we approach the game's release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Launching on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>, the box art isn't really anything surprising; it's basically a variation of the main key art we've seen since the initial Switch 2 Direct back in April. Still, it looks lovely! Like most major Nintendo games these days, it's likely there won't be any regional differences for this one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for those looking to purchase the game on the eShop, you can expect it to take up a total of <strong>25GB</strong> on your Switch 2 storage.</p>
<p>As for the price, it'll cost <strong>$69.99</strong> in the US and <strong>£58.99</strong> in the UK. It's not currently known whether the physical edition will be more expensive, but we'll let you know as soon as we can.</p>

			<p>Halo is coming to PlayStation, but not in the way <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">you might have been hoping for</a>, at least for now. A new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/">Helldivers 2 warbond</a> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">game's arrival on Xbox next week</a> brings the look of Halo: ODST to Super Earth's brave Helldivers across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>If you showed a gamer from 20 years ago the following trailer, where a Halo-related announcement began with the PlayStation Studios logo, they'd be shocked and awed. But in 2025, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded set to arrive on PS5 next week</a>, and several previously Xbox-exclusive titles already on PlayStation, it's far less surprising, but no less fun to see for anyone who remembers what the divide between platforms felt like 20 years ago.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O_9hwQ8jLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The warbond will feature classic Halo weapons like the MA5C Assault Rifle and the M6C/SOCOM Pistol, and the ODST-styled armor set that Halo fans know so well. It'll also feature new capes, armor passive, player banners and a player title.</p>

<p>The warbond will be available the same day that Helldivers 2 arrives on Xbox Series X/S, on August 26, 2025. Which is also the same day that Gears of War: Reloaded will arrive on PlayStation 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kirby Air Riders Release Date Set for November, Tons of New Info Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kirby-air-riders-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-release-date-set-for-november-tons-of-new-info-revealed.1273776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed a ton of new information about upcoming racing sequel <i>Kirby Air Riders</i>, including when you can expect to play the game.</p>

<p>In a new Nintendo Direct presentation aired earlier today, Nintendo, along with&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>director (and Nintendo legend) Masahiro Sakurai, revealed that&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>will be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20th.</p>

<p>Along with revealing the release date, Sakurai and Nintendo also divulged lots of new info about&nbsp;<em>Air Riders</em>' gameplay mechanics, characters, and game modes, and it sounds like the game will boast Sakurai's usual maximalist design philosophy (which is definitely a good thing!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=JxorEaKP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=Ng6yfY_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>is launching in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>takes the form of a sort of auto-racer; you won't need to press any buttons to accelerate, but you will need to perform maneuvers to outfox your opponents, use specials to gain advantages, and more.</p>

<p>Each rider has different stats; Kirby, for instance, has a different weight stat to King Dedede, who won't feel the same to play as Meta Knight. You'll need to weigh up which racer you want to use on which course if you want to win.</p>

<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Ride&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll probably recognize the returning City Trial mode, which has been expanded; it now takes place on a massive floating island by the name of Skyah, which is a free-roaming map packed with events to enjoy.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also be able to take part in the game's titular Air Ride mode, which sees you and up to five other riders competing to cross the finish line, as well as other gameplay modes to try out.</p>




<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>' release in November means it's one of two major Nintendo racing games to be released during the Switch 2's launch window, with the other naturally being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch game&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Switch 2 exclusive list is getting longer with the racing game <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> coming to the console on November 20th. Today, Nintendo offered a luxurious 45 minutes devoted to its<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"> cutest pink blob</a> who, when you think about it, is really an eldritch horror of incalculable power. Here are the highlights from the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct.</p><p>Before even getting to the action of <em>Air Riders</em>, we were greeted with a smiling but tired sigh <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch">from director (and Kirby’s dad) Masahiro Sakurai</a>. He explained that he was approached to lead <em>Air Riders</em> while he was working on <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> DLC, and that the new Kirby is a collaboration between his studio Sora and Bandai Namco.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> takes the original GameCube classic and modernizes it for the Switch 2. You can choose many more riders to play as instead of just Kirby including King Dedede, Banana Waddle Dee, and some cool-looking guy I just heard of named Knuckle Joe. The game also supports up to eight players in local wireless play or up to 16 players online.</p><p>And what will you do with those other 15 players? There’s races, point challenges, battle arenas, and good ole’ fashioned exploration. In <em>Air Riders</em> you can choose any number of racing machines, each with their own unique traits, and upgrade them to your hearts content. Is your paper glider machine too fragile? Spend some time exploring, gathering power ups to make it beefier. Then use your newly improved machine in a challenge designed to take advantage of your racer’s new stats.</p><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the first game directed by Masahiro Sakurai ever since<a href="https://kotaku.com/please-for-the-love-of-god-let-masahiro-sakurai-rest-1845241032"> Nintendo’s tiredest soldier</a> finished up work on<em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. In the interim, he’s been<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23320915/masahiro-sakurai-youtube-channel-creating-games"> running a series of educational videos on YouTube</a> sharing his experiences and lessons learned in game development while also, apparently, directing A<em>ir Riders. </em></p><p>That <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is showing up now along with *<strong>inhales</strong>* <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, has bolstered my<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23205240/kirby-dream-buffet-nintendo-wholesome"> Kirby Theory of Distress</a> which hypothesizes that Nintendo releases a Kirby game whenever the world is in worse than average trouble. Kirby comes to save us once again in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> launching on the Switch 2 November 20th.</p><p>In the meantime, Switch Online subscribers can get an early taste of the game’s soundtrack through the Nintendo Music app, which just added seven tracks ahead of <em>Air Riders</em>’ launch.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761317/kirby-air-riders-release-date-november]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The latest update for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> begins with an apology. Recognizing that communication with players hasn’t been Funcom’s strong suit of late, the developer explains that it’s in part because of “state mandated” vacations.</p> <p>“I apologize if people feel the communication around issues with the game has been lacking,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/515218419125060312">the latest update posted to Steam</a> (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dune-awakening-promises-an-endgame-overhaul-and-says-communication-has-been-bad-because-developers-had-state-mandated-vacations/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “We are focused on improving this. With a percentage of the team having their well-earned (and state mandated) vacations, customer service and the community team have not always had access to developers who can answer their every question.”</p> <p>If you’ve ever been on a trip to Norway (and Sweden) during July, you’ll have learned the hard way (I speak from experience) that <em>everything is closed</em>. This is a result of <em>fellesferie</em>, the annual summer “common holidays” where just about everyone takes their vacation at the same time. Which is quite mad, but for Norwegians, entirely ordinary. It’s normal for offices to just close down in July, and people who do persist in working during the month will struggle if they rely on suoport from their colleagues. It appears to be <em>fellesferie</em><em>&nbsp;</em>that’s affected&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p>

 <p>Regarding the enforced nature of these vacations, Norway has something called the The Holiday Act, that mandates all employees receive 25 days of vacation a year, meaning it’s even more tricky to prevent an entire team all disappearing off at once.</p> <p>“We’ve been playing whack-a-mole with bugs, cheats and exploits during the July month of summer,” says Funcom. “We’ve banned thousands of cheaters, fixed a bunch of duplication and exploit bugs and continued working on the stability of the game. We’ve been working to achieve a cadence of patches that allows us time to make stable and consistent fixes, while being fast enough to address issues like exploits before they get too far out of control. Live Game development is a blend of reactivity and long term planning.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618409">© Funcom</figcaption></figure> <p>While players have loved <em>Awakening</em>, there’s been a lot of dissatisfaction around what there is to do once the main content is finished. Funcom explains that its Gamescom news is going to be focused on the Chapter 2 Free Update and The Lost Harvest DLC, neither of which will affect the endgame, saying, “this is because Chapter 2 and the DLC were planned and began development before launch.” But, it goes on to list what’s happening in the later stages.</p>

 <p>It seems the big problem facing Funcom, other than an empty office, is that&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> has drawn in what it describes as “very different demographics,” who all want something different from the MMO’s endgame. However, the issues are boiled down to “loss of items/vehicles, players feeling that they are forced into PvP, exploits and cheats, and lack of endgame content/grind.” Arriving soon are the following changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Improved Player Logging</b>&nbsp;– One of the key frustrations we see is the lack of information and clarity around why certain items/objects/vehicles are gone. We will increase the information in your logs so that you have a better idea of what is going on. For example, listing the names of people who take things from chests in your base.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Vehicle Salvaging System</b>&nbsp;– We’re working on a vehicle salvaging system that will allow you to recover lost vehicles.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Cobalt Paste/Vehicle Inventory&nbsp;</b>– We’re adjusting the volume of the infamous cobalt paste and adding more slots to the Assault Ornithopter vehicle inventory. We will be adding a cargo container that can be carried by the Carrier Ornithopter.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Instanced Deep Desert Loot</b>&nbsp;– The constant camping and queuing of the Deep Desert Testing Stations leads to a frustrating experience where people arrive at an empty Testing Station. We’re going to change these to be more in line with the rest of the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Offline Notifications about important events&nbsp;</b>– We understand that not everybody can or wants to log in to check power/taxes constantly in the game. We would like to create a notification service that sends you the status of your base via email. This one is squarely aimed at you, Ben.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The post then continues with longer-term plans for endgame content:</p> <blockquote> <p>As we’ve mentioned previously, the Landsraad is supposed to be the endgame activity driver. Currently it does not have the breadth or depth of content or progression to serve that function. As we work towards Chapter 3, we will begin to tie the faction progression of the game to the Landsraad, while also systematically building out the Landsraad with a greater variety of activities across the world.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As a player this means that you can increase your faction rank by completing Landsraad tasks, checking in with your Duke or Baron occasionally to perform special missions and visit faction vendors.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>Landsraad activities will become contract based, rather than delivery based, which will allow us to effectively remove the issue of stockpiling that is currently endemic in the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>This ensures that people are rewarded for solo play (as well as making contributions easier for them to track) and will give you many choices in how you progress over time.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As for the planned activities, we have plenty in mind in addition to the current testing stations and shipwrecks. The following list contains examples, and not promises, as these will take work and time to deliver. But currently we are thinking of things like: Assassinations, Treasure Maps, Races, Construction Challenges, Duels, Faction vs Faction maps, Improved control points, Scavenger Hunts, Temporary Crafting Challenges etc.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>These activities will make use of the Overland Map, spawning in new maps as required. We have always wanted to flesh out the Overland Map over time, and this will boost that along.</p> <p>Of course, we are open to your suggestions so please share with us on social media the kinds of activities you would like to see in the Landsraad.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As the Landsraad activities become more fleshed out, we will then transition the Deep Desert back towards the original intention – a sandbox area where players can compete for control of the spice. We will continue to iterate on the Deep Desert – adding no-fly zones to enforce ground combat, adding more layouts with more variety and challenge, and ensuring that there is clear progression. In addition, we are experimenting with the tech behind the Deep Desert and if things go well, you will experience the Deep Desert in a much more stable environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>This will apparently be the focus for the rest of 2025, now everyone’s back in the office. Before they all take off again for Christmas.</p>

              <p><span>I never really think of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>as a great game for recreating other movies and music videos until I see the lengths some creators go to use Nintendo’s life sim as their movie studio. I’ve been obsessed with Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> for the past month, and several nights a week I’ll find myself scrolling through my feeds looking for reaction videos, covers, and other indulgences to feed my ongoing brainrot. Now, I’ve found an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>channel that is recreating all the movie’s musical numbers in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, and I’m mostly just surprised at the creative solutions they came up with to make up for the game’s lack of fantasy weaponry and demons.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone who’s played </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>knows that it has some pretty robust creative options in terms of outfit design, character customization, and even set creation. Where the challenge lies in recreating something like a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>music video is in finding animations, items, and characters that can at least somewhat emulate things that don’t exist in the game. YouTuber Magic Studios, who has recreated almost every musical moment in the film, has managed to use the tools in </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>to creatively represent actions like demon fighting and skydiving from a busted plane, and, to the best of their ability, tried to capture the film’s choreography.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: What It Sounds Like (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKk9WeRNXxg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of the most clever details will likely hit hardest for people who have both seen the movie and put an exorbitant amount of time into perfecting their </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>island, such as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-tom-nook-is-misunderstood-506751609"><span>money-loving tanuki Tom Nook</span></a><span> representing Gwi-ma, the demon king final boss that the Kpop girl group Huntr/x faces in the finale. My favorite part of these videos, however, is seeing how Magic Studios recreated different costumes for both the main cast and side characters using </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>’ Custom Designs feature. Some videos are more elaborate than others, like the “Golden” music video which faithfully recreates the movie’s pre-performance hype cycle as the girls are promoting the upcoming single.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: GOLDEN (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arDp3X_5lyg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>You can check out all of Magic Studios’ </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> videos </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@magicstudios7112"><span>on their channel</span></a><span>.

Not one moment of the broadcast was wasted, with Sakurai filling every second with either confirmation of a new or returning mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights include that long-awaited release date, copy abilities for all of the many new Riders, changes to City Trial, and much, much more. If you missed the show, there’s no need to worry; we’ve included all of the major announcements and reveals for you right here. You can take a look below for everything announced during the Kirby Air Riders Nintendo Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Air Riders Confirms November Release Date</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Are you ready to ride? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KirbyAirRiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#KirbyAirRiders</a> launches Nov 20 on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NintendoSwitch2</a>! <a href="https://t.co/72zZGfNcB7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/72zZGfNcB7</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1957804878413066458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Just as the Kirby Air Riders Nintendo Direct came to a close, Nintendo announced that Nintendo Switch 2 players will be able to pick up the long-awaited sequel come November 20, 2025. It’s a release date that sets launch firmly in 2025 while still giving the Mario Kart-like Kirby game some time away from June’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world"><u>Mario Kart World</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Air Riders Finally Adds More Playable Riders</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">More Kirby Air Riders...riders. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIntendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NIntendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/7wLBNLLZ5N" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7wLBNLLZ5N</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1957793084550308185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Chef Kawasaki, and Bandana Waddle Dee have all joined the Kirby Air Riders roster as playable Riders. It’s a pretty big change from the original Kirby Air Ride, which mostly only allowed players to choose from different versions of Kirby. Only a few moments into the show, it's clear there will be many, many other playable Riders to choose from, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Air Riders Gets a Second Button to Press</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: A second button has been added to Kirby Air Riders. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/jQnMEydwlA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jQnMEydwlA</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1957791896132026862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While the original Kirby Air Ride only gave players one button to press, Kirby Air Riders will up the ante with an additional button. The B button will allow players to boost, with the Y button added to allow the use of special abilities. These include the freedom to switch to new machines, unleash unique moves for each rider, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Super Smash Bros. Team Reunited for Kirby Air Riders</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After asking the age-old question, “Why is making a game so hard?” the creator made the point to clarify which development teams have been working on Kirby Air Riders. Players will be happy to know that both Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco, the same team behind Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, as well as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, re-teamed to make Kirby Air Riders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sakurai Admits Kirby Air Riders “Basically Is Like Mario Kart”</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kirby Air Riders <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gamescom2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Gamescom2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/dEjBBjBfyP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dEjBBjBfyP</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1957794520923259047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai is no stranger to Nintendo Directs, and fans know the Super Smash Bros. director loves to sneak in light-hearted comments when he hosts a presentation. Today’s Kirby Air Riders Nintendo Direct was no different, with the legendary game maker jokingly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakurai-says-kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-in-extremely-smash-bros-style-direct"><u>confirming Kirby Air Ride “basically is like Mario Kart.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With both series focusing on racing mechanics and, now, a strong roster of characters, the similarities are hard to deny. That said, as shown during today’s broadcast, it’s clear the Kirby spinoff does more than enough to stand apart as a completely different experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Isn’t the Only Rider With Copy Abilities</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">During the development of Kirby Air Riders, Sakurai and the rest of the team realized it might be unfair for Kirby to be the only character with the option to copy abilities. So, naturally, they decided to let everyone from Meta Knight to King Dedede copy the powers of enemies and even change their appearance for the first time in the series’ history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, we did,” Sakurai said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Up to 16 Players Can Play City Trial at a Time</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Up to 16 players can play City Trial together in Kirby Air Riders. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NintendoDirect</a> <a href="https://t.co/kkdA1zDCFA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kkdA1zDCFA</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1957796396762890323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders will allow players to join in groups of 16 when playing its open City Trial mode online. That's a significant increase from the original four-player multiplaer support, with players will able to race around the dense Skyah map, which is said to be quite a bit larger than what fans may be used to and features a variety of different themed areas. Additionally, City Trial supports up to eight players when playing via local wireless support.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Starlit Journey Main Theme Revealed, Out on Nintendo Music Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With so much of today’s Nintendo Direct focused on Kirby Air Riders gameplay, Sakurai still made sure to talk about some of the game’s new music. Specifically, fans were treated to a snippet of the sequel’s main theme, Starlit Journey. It, along with a selection of other Kirby Air Riders tunes, will be made available via the Nintendo Music app later today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">But Wait, There’s More</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With nearly every second of the Kirby Air Riders Nintendo Direct dedicated to showing off something new, it’s no surprise to hear that Sakurai and Bandai Namco have more to talk about. The director closed today’s presentation with the tease that he’d like to talk more about Kirby Air Riders in the future, though it’s unclear if this additional information will arrive in the form of another Nintendo Direct, a blog post, or something else entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the very least, we now know players will get to go hands-on with Kirby Air Riders when PAX West 2025 comes to Seattle later this month. With the release date now only a few months away, we’ll hopefully know more about Nintendo’s plans soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo's big Switch 2 direct back in April revealed a lot of games releasing during the console's launch window, and one of them was Kirby Air Riders, an apparent sequel to the GameCube racer from 2003. Today, Masahiro Sakurai himself walked us through the new game in great detail, showing off its characters, mechanics, modes, and ending with a release date.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4">Watch The Archive Of The Kirby Air Riders Direct Here</a></h3><p>The original Kirby Air Ride's big selling point is its simplicity – everyone plays as Kirby (save for two unlockable cameos), and there's only one button, which you use to drift around corners. It's only natural that the sequel, Kirby Air Riders, would expand on each of these aspects. For starters, you can play as a lot more than just Kirby. Here's the full roster so far:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Kirby</li><li aria-level="1">Meta Knight</li><li aria-level="1">Waddle Dee</li><li aria-level="1">King Deedeedee</li><li aria-level="1">Chef Kawasaki</li><li aria-level="1">Cappy</li><li aria-level="1">Magolor</li><li aria-level="1">Gooey</li><li aria-level="1">Waddle Doo</li><li aria-level="1">Knuckle Joe</li><li aria-level="1">Susie</li><li aria-level="1">Starman</li></ul>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b923da88-427e-4753-b4f9-e6a96baafa5d" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>Each character has slight differences. While Kirby is a simple, all-around racer, Meta Knight can glide, King Deedeedee can swing his hammer, and Cappy (the little mushroom, not to be confused with Mario's sentient hat) can use his mushroom cap to avoid taking damage. Each rider is relatively balanced, however. While Kirby was the only one who could copy abilities in the original, now everyone can gain copy abilities from enemies roaming the tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a second button now; when your meter is full, press Y to activate a special move, unique to each character. They unleash an attack and/or speed boost to give you a big advantage right when the moment demands it. It's another incentive to choose a character other than Kirby.</p><p>The two modes detailed are Air Ride, a standard race that now supports up to six players, and City Trial, where players explore an open map to collect power-ups before facing off in the end. City Trial now has a new map, too – the floating island of Skyah, a mishmash of different mini-areas to explore. Up to eight players (on different consoles) can play City Trial locally, but it supports up to 16 online.</p><p>Finally, the showcase ended with a tease of a mysterious new character with an exhaust pipe for an eye. Then, we got a release date: November 20, 2025. Kirby Air Riders will be available just three months from tomorrow, making it one of Nintendo's big holiday games.

<p>Yes, the best mode from the GameCube original is returning for the Switch 2 sequel, and it looks just as high-octane and bonkers as we would have hoped.</p>
<p>The Direct introduced us to Skyah, the new hub world for this mode, which you'll have to speed around to collect and build the best machine that you can. This sandbox area looks substantially bigger than the one we know from the early 2000s, with several different zones like caves, volcanoes, oceans and more.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>With the machine built (and the five-minute time limit up), it's off to the races in the Stadium events, which will put your build through its paces. Much like in the original, these events range from agility tests, to long-jump competitions, so there's something for every build.</p>
<p>Honestly, this was how we spent most of our time with Air Ride on the GameCube, so it'll be interesting to see whether bigger really does mean better when this one arrives on Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-collaboration-confirmed-in-latest-warbond.1273704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Xbox have confirmed that the teased&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover is indeed real, and it's taking the form of the game's latest Warbond, which also happens to be its first "Legendary Warbond".</p>

<p>The crossover was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased" rel="nofollow">first teased</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer promoting the game's Xbox release, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">set for next Tuesday</a>. Rather than a new map or an in-game event,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover will instead take the form of a Warbond.</p>

<p>That means you can expect new weapons, new armor and capes, and all the other good stuff that usually comes with a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, but as the "Legendary" designation suggests, Sony and Arrowhead reckon they're kicking it up a notch with this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=2ZatJhGW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=JR7IMNeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond brings lots of new&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>-themed gear to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>This Warbond comes complete with four weapons, and they should all be pretty familiar to&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fans. The MA5C assault rifle is an iconic weapon that packs an ammo counter and a compass, while the M6C pistol boasts <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s first suppressor.</p>

<p>The M90A shotgun has a flashlight attached to it to help you see what you're shooting in darker areas, and the M7S SMG includes a suppressor you can't remove, so it's perfect for sneakier engagements (although it'll still rip enemies to shreds in a loud firefight).</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond if there wasn't some armor to enjoy as well, and the&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond features two sets: the A-9 Helljumper and the A-35 Recon, both modeled after iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>characters.</p>

<p>There's plenty more included as part of this Warbond as well, so make sure you check out the full announcement over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a> if you want to see everything that's included.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond will be available on August 26th, which is the same day the game launches on Xbox Series X|S. It's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">our review of it right here</a>.</p>

Shipping is expected to start as early as October 2025. Although the company is concurrently <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flip-1s-flip-dual-screen-full-keyboard-handheld#/">running another Indiegogo campaign</a> for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684190/ayaneo-flip-1s-ds-nintendo-windows-handheld-dual-screen">similar dual-screen handheld called the Flip 1S</a>, that device features more powerful specs, runs Windows 11, and starts at $1,279 with discounts, while the less expensive Pocket DS runs Android 13.</p></div><p>There are currently many handhelds that replicate the design and functionality of Nintendo’s iconic portables, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">Game Boy Color</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, but few can properly recreate the Nintendo DS experience, which is still Nintendo’s best-selling console of all time. The new Pocket DS potentially fits that bill with a 7-inch, 16:9, 1080P OLED folding top screen paired with a smaller 5-inch, 4:3, 1,024x768 LCD display on the handheld itself.</p><p>It will be powered by a very capable Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 processor, but we don’t yet know what the Pocket DS’ emulation capabilities will be. The entry-level model features 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (expandable through a microSD card slot), but the Pocket DS can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, pushing its price to $759, or $639 with early backer discounts.</p><p>The handheld also features a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">anti-drift TMR joysticks</a>, Hall effect triggers with sensitivity adjustments, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, gyroscopic controls, a fingerprint scanning power button, and an 8,000mAh battery. Ayaneo hasn’t revealed the handheld’s actual battery life, but it will offer multiple performance modes and the ability to turn off the second screen for those trying to max out their playtime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761296/ayaneo-pocket-ds-dual-screen-handheld-android-13]]></content:encoded>

The name "Swords Of Legends" does not exactly cultivate intrigue. File it alongside Legendary Sword, Sword Legends, Legend of Sword, and Sword: Legends under "game titles that would put me to sleep even if I were being steadily electrocuted". Having visited the official site for Swords and watched the Chinese announcement trailer, I have come up with some alternative, vastly superior English titles: 1) My House Is Unaccountably Peckish, 2) Can I Play Football With This Boss's Detachable Head, 3) A Kingdom For My Horsebro, and 4) Did That Mountain Just Sideeye Me.</p><!--more-->

<p>
Developed by Aurogon Shanghai with Wangyuan Shengtang publishing, Sword Of Legends is the fourth main game in the Gujian series, which I'm not familiar with. Occasional Rock Paper Shotgun contributor Khee Hoon Chan has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gujian-3-comes-close-to-being-the-final-fantasy-of-chinese-rpgs/">a PCGamer write-up</a> of the third one in which they describe it as "close to being the Final Fantasy of Chinese RPGs". As with Final Fantasy, the devs insist that you don't need to have played the other Gujian games to enjoy this one.
</p>
<p>
The new game is a premium (i.e. not free-to-play) single player action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with an obvious Soulslike flow to its boss battles. You are an underworld enforcer who must "guide the departed" by kicking their heads in, whether attached or not. It's ceremonially described on the official site as "wide linear" - a mixture of story-led fights and sidequests that is neither as sprawling as an open world game, nor as suffocating as many Soulslikes. It's set, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, in a realm inspired by Chinese mythology and folklore.
</p><p>
As the aforesaid Stygian copper, your combat abilities range from combos, dodges and parries to capturing the souls of munsters and unleashing them against the next wayward phantom you encounter. There's a neat bit in the trailer when the player uses a companion creature's out-thrust spear as a springboard. Horseguy, you're so dependable! Not like those horsegirls in that viral gacha game the top brass keep telling me to write about.
</p>
<p>
I'd say I'm weary of action-RPGs inspired by Chinese myth, after Wuchang and Wukong, but that would be outright hypocrisy, given that I still knock back Tolkien-esque fantasies by the flagon. Besides, I've always wanted to be eaten by a house. It's probably the nearest I'll ever come to owning one. Swards Of Legumes doesn't have a release date yet, but there's a Q&amp;A with more details on <a href="https://www.swordsoflegends.com/?language=EN">the offical site</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-looks-like-way-more-than-just-another-switch-2-racing-game.1273695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A 45-minute deep-dive into <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> revealed all the ways it’s setting itself apart from other kart racers. While director Masahiro Sakurai began <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-kirby-air-riders-smash-bros-sakurai-2000618190">the latest Nintendo Direct</a> by joking that his new Switch 2 exclusive is basically <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569">just <em>Mario Kart</em></a>, everything that followed built the case for why it’s actually much more. Essentially a<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> Let’s Play starring the <em>Smash Bros.</em> director himself, the showcase revealed new modes, mechanics, and the game’s release date.</p> <p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will come to Switch 2 on November 22. In addition to the main racing mode, it’ll also feature a series of other contests, from time trials to a destruction mode that looks an awful lot like <em>Twisted Meta</em>l. The menus and sound effects look <a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-sakurai-youtube-sequel-switch-2-1851678195">straight out of <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, including the win screen that shows characters applauding. The entire showcase even ended with a surprise reveal for what seems to be a new Kirby character that looks like Meta Knight if he were dragged out of an alternate, post-apocalyptic dimension.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The main attraction in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the titular Air Riders mode. While it’s structured much like the original GameCube release back in 2003, a second button has been added to the control scheme. In addition to pressing a button to drift around corners and building up boost, characters also have access to a special ability that can be unleashed to speed up or attack other players. The courses are also bigger this time around to accommodate more racers, with an updated roster and vehicle garage for players to mix and match with.</p>

 <p>The returning City Trials mode looked with up to 16 players this time looks far more interesting. Like <em>Mario Kart World,</em> it drops you into a big sandbox where you drive around exploring and collecting power-ups. Random events then spawn that you can join to compete in with your upgraded vehicle. The challenges range from battles to gobbling up as much food on the map as possible. There are also mini-games reminiscent of hitting the sandbag in Smash Bros., with players aiming and flinging themselves at a wall of different scoring cubes to rack up points.</p> <p>Whether that’s all enough to make <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feel like the big November release the Switch 2 deserves remains to be seen. It’ll arrive just a month after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Sakurai ended his stream saying that there’s still more to reveal in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, hinting at another Nintendo Direct coming sometime in the fall. In the meantime, it would be great to get the GameCube version on Switch Online.</p>

Enhancing and expanding upon <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>, originally released for the Nintendo <a title="Platforms > GameCube" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/gamecube">GameCube</a> system in 2003, this new game will now give players a roster of riders to choose from, each with their own distinct characteristics and abilities. In addition, there are new Air Ride machines, returning game modes, and new Special moves! <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is fast-paced mayhem from Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Studios, Inc.</p><p>Read below for more about the features and gameplay spotlighted by Mr. Sakurai:</p><ul><li><strong>Riding Techniques</strong> – Each Air Ride machine, or “machine” for short, has different forms and traits. They usually hover above the ground and move forward automatically—no need to press any buttons or tilt the left Joy-Con 2 control stick forward to accelerate. Use the left stick to change direction by tilting it left or right. So, what do the buttons do?</li><li><strong>Boost Charge</strong> – By pressing the B Button, your machine will hit the ground, and you’ll start a Boost Charge and brake. Releasing the button activates a Boost Dash. As Mr. Sakurai explained, this is more than just a speed boost—by tilting the left stick and holding the Boost Charge button through sharp corners, you can perform drift maneuvers, which help you gain even more of a speed advantage.</li><li><strong>Specials</strong> – It takes more than speed and deft maneuvering to get ahead of the competition, however. The Y Button is your “Special button,” and it activates your character’s unique Special move. Attack your rival riders and enemies to fill up your Special Gauge and, once full, unleash your Special! While most characters have one distinct Special, Kirby has four different Special moves—one for each color Kirby you can play as. Combine certain Specials with attack techniques like Quick Spin, which is activated by wiggling the control stick, and you’ll be on your way to victory!</li><li><strong>Riders</strong> – <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> adds a strategic element to its mayhem by adding more importance to your choice of rider. Each rider in the game has their own unique traits which can impact their machine’s performance, including weight, durability, Specials, close range attacks and more. These factors can either give them an advantage or cause more unpredictability during the action depending on the environment you’re in. In fact, this is why Air Ride mode has you select your course first, then the rider and machine you want to use. In addition to the well-balanced pink puff, your roster of riders includes familiar faces from the world of Kirby, like <a title="Platforms > Meta [148 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a> Knight, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, as well as enemies in the Kirby series like Cappy, Chef Kawasaki, Starman and… well, you’ll just have to play and see who else shows up, won’t you? And to keep you moving forward and keep your opponents on their toes, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> also lets you mix and match riders and machines.</li><li><strong>Machines</strong> – Air Ride machines are built for more than just speed! Each machine, like the riders, can even sustain different amounts of damage. Most machines will also glide through the air if you jump from a ramp or other structure, and you can control your machine by tilting the left stick up or down to ascend or descend. Make a perfect landing and you’ll be rewarded with more speed. You can also perform rail grinds, drifts and other maneuvers.</li><li><strong>Copy Abilities</strong> – To level the playing field, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> gives all the riders the ability to inhale or capture to copy an enemy’s abilities. Use these newly acquired abilities to temporarily gain additional ways to attack or increase your speed.</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_985185"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mr. Sakurai also unveiled the returning game modes and experiences that await players in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, including City Trial mode, which he described as “the main event.” The mode from the original <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> returns, this time expanded and enhanced with more room to explore:</p><ul><li><strong>Skyah</strong> – City Trial is now located on a huge floating island called Skyah! Here, you’ll drive around freely collecting power-ups, attacking opponents to damage (and steal) their machines or cause them to drop power-ups you can then scoop up for yourself, all with the objective of upgrading your machine as much as possible. You start out with a small, weak machine, but through finding power-ups, attacking opponents and swapping to other machines, you can upgrade your ride. There are also random Field Events that occur throughout this phase. Some of these events pop up unexpectedly somewhere on the Skyah map, and you’ll need to hustle to that location to participate. Events include challenges like Short Race, where you’ll race through a sectioned-off area of the map, with power-ups awarded based on how you finish. There is also Dustup Derby, where the goal is to battle your opponents to knock them out and earn more power-ups. Be warned, these events may also involve the appearance of familiar bosses from the world of Kirby, including Kracko and Dyna Blade! This is only the first phase of the City Trial experience, and you’ll have five minutes of intense vehicle action to secure your machine and as many power-ups as you can. After that, it’s on to phase two…</li><li><strong>Stadiums</strong> – Take your powered-up machine to a Stadium and compete to be crowned the winner. Each Stadium includes a different challenge that players will strategically select based on the power-ups you or your opponents have gathered. Some Stadiums will even be recommended for you based on your machine’s stats, in case you have any trouble deciding which one to take on. In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, you can also battle friends via local wireless with up to eight players, or online with up to 16 players. Use GameChat to connect with your friends via video or voice chat to enhance the fun!</li></ul><p>In addition to City Trial, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> features other returning modes with updated features, including …</p><ul><li><strong>Air Ride Mode</strong> – In this mode, up to six riders can compete to cross the finish line first. Attack opposing riders and by hitting them you’ll gain small stars that increase your speed. What makes this experience unique is that you’ll compete by getting speed boosts via attacking! So go ahead and cut loose on your rivals! You can also follow the Star Slide—you speed up by following behind other riders and collecting the trail of stars in their wake. These extra speed boosts will help you leave your opponents in the (star) dust.</li><li><strong>Lessons</strong> – With all the different riders, machines, techniques and game modes—you may want a little time to practice. The Lessons mode allows you to learn the basics of the game and try out some of the more advanced gameplay mechanics.<br>Plus, if you have a <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> Online membership then you’re in luck! Seven tracks from the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> soundtrack—including the main theme with English language vocals—will be released on the <em><a title="Games > Nintendo Music [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nintendo-music">Nintendo Music</a></em> app later today!</li></ul><p>And this is all just the beginning. Now that you’re up to speed on what awaits in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, there’s more news waiting in the wings, so please stay tuned for further updates.</p></blockquote><p>Watch an archive of today’s <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct below.

                <p dir="ltr">Today, Nintendo released its next Nintendo Direct presentation focused solely on Kirby Air Riders, the next project from Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai. Before diving into the details on Kirby's next adventure, Sakurai gave a peek behind the development curtain with a particularly interesting line--he was worried a new Kirby Air Riders would be too much like Nintendo's other racing franchise, Mario Kart.</p><p dir="ltr">Sakurai made the comment during the beginning of the presentation, as he mentioned to both Nintendo corporate president Shinya Takahashi and then-president of HAL Laboratory Satoshi Mitsuhara that there are similarities between Air Riders and Mario Kart. As Sakurai himself said in the presentation, "OK, so it is basically Mario Kart."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QtkHiB7WKf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I even mentioned this when I received the request to make the game," Sakurai said. "I asked them if they still wanted to do it, but as fans of the original know, the appeal of the game is actually not the races!"</p><p dir="ltr">The 45-minute deep dive into Kirby Air Riders revealed many details about the upcoming racer, including the characters and vehicles players will be racing with, as well as the floating island of Skyah that serves as the game's setting. Multiple modes, including City Trial with up to 16 players, were also detailed during the presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">Kirby Air Riders will launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Facing mounting pressure from lawmakers and a newly filed lawsuit by the state of Louisiana, Roblox recently issued a lengthy statement addressing what it calls “erroneous claims and misconceptions.” But reports suggest the Louisiana lawsuit is just the tip of what will eventually be a very large legal iceberg, as the platform faces rampant allegations that it has failed to protect the young people who make up the majority of its playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">Roblox is a wildly popular game creation platform that hosts user-made games like Dress to Impress (which recently launched a collaboration with pop icon Lady Gaga), Grow a Garden, and Brookhaven. It sees tens of millions of daily active users (reported numbers vary between 82 and 111 million), and almost 40% of its playerbase is children under the age of 13. As such, it has faced intense scrutiny amid several reports (including a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">massive one published by Bloomberg last year</a>) that allege the platform does not do enough to protect children.</p><p dir="ltr">On August 15, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">just days after California Congressman Ro Khanna said</a>, "Roblox is simply not doing enough to protect our kids, to inform parents, and to go after child predators,” the <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322" rel="nofollow ">state of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against the company</a>. The lawsuit, which was brought in the 21st Judicial District of Louisiana, alleges that Roblox:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><em>Has and continues to facilitate the distribution of child sexual abuse material and the sexual exploitation of Louisiana’s children.</em></li><li dir="ltr"><em>Knowingly and intentionally fails to implement basic safety controls to protect child users from predators.</em></li><li dir="ltr"><em>Knowingly and intentionally fails to provide notice to parents and child users of its dangers.</em></li></ul><p dir="ltr">In October of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings" rel="nofollow ">Roblox introduced “parent accounts”</a> to the platform, which allow parents to manage their child’s account, including blocking people on their friends list. However, a recent petition demanding Roblox do more, statements from politicians like Khanna, and the Louisiana lawsuit all suggest these steps are not enough.</p><p dir="ltr">An<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" rel="nofollow "> August</a><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> 18 Wired </a><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-roblox-getting-worse/" rel="nofollow ">report</a> says a group of law firms across the United States plans to file "a flood of lawsuits" in the near future, "all for clients who accuse the platform of allegedly facilitating the sexual exploitation of and grooming of their kids." One lawyer who spoke to Wired, Matt Dolman from Dolman Law Group, said his firm has "about 300 of these cases," and expects there to be over 1,000 lawsuits filed "by this time next year." Dolman said the majority of his Roblox clients are under the age of 16, and more than half are young girls.</p><p dir="ltr">There are already several lawsuits that have been filed against Roblox, including <a href="https://www.anapolweiss.com/john-doe-v-roblox-and-discord-jury-trial-demanded.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one in Alabama</a> filed this past July after a 14-year-old girl allegedly met a predator on Roblox, began chatting with him on the messaging app Discord, and was reportedly abducted and assaulted. The lawsuit names both Roblox and Discord as defendants.</p><p dir="ltr">“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home,” said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill in a statement that accompanied the Louisiana lawsuit filing.</p><p dir="ltr">That same day, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit" rel="nofollow ">Roblox issued a lengthy statement on its website</a>, which begins with the caveat that the company does not usually comment on pending litigation, but wanted to “address erroneous claims and misconceptions about our platform, our commitment to safety, and our overall safety track record.”</p><p dir="ltr">The statement cites Roblox’s safety tools, which the company says it is “constantly innovating,” its “industry-leading stance on age-based communication,” its “suite of easy-to-use parental controls,” and past collaborations with law enforcement, among other things, as examples of its dedication to child safety.</p><p dir="ltr">“We aim to create one of the safest online environments for users, a goal not only core to our founding values but contrary to certain assertions, one we believe is critical to our long-term vision and success. We understand there is always more work to be done, and we are committed to making Roblox a safe and positive environment for all users,” the statement reads.</p><p dir="ltr">Dolman told Wired there is "a working group" of lawyers from several law firms who have already spoken to several clients accusing Roblox of failing to protect their children.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Roblox for comment.</p>

<p>The Air Riders release date news came during the special 45-minute Nintendo Direct focused on the game. Kirby Air Riders is directed by Masahiro Sakurai. If that name sounds familiar, it's probably because he was the director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> on Switch, and he created Kirby.</p>
<p>The original Kirby Air Ride was notoriously not loved by everyone. Leading UK games magazine, Edge, awarded the game a less than positive 3/10 rating back in issue 127. <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN.com</a> scored the game a similarly disappointing 5.2/10.</p>

              <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> latest update has given players plenty of new things to do, from grinding for new talismans to trying not to die to the new 9-star boss fights. But players on PC are still struggling with poor performance optimization, and Capcom now says no major fixes will be ready until the winter.</p> <p><span>“To our hunters playing <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </span><span>on PC, we’re committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game,” an update posted on X on August 18 <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">reads</a>. “Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards. We’ll share more information on the specifics in the future.”</span></p> <p>The response from fans so far has been less than stellar. “It’s not normal to wait one year to get at least a small optimization for PC players,” wrote one. “We are paying for stability and performance as the same time free updates. I have a war machine and i have to play everything on LOW hoping it’s going well.” Another posted, “Love MHWilds I really do, but waiting almost a year for the game to run at least a little better is a bit crazy.”</p>

 <p>Similar sentiments have been echoed across the game’s subreddit and recent Steam reviews where <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still sits at just 25 percent, up from an all-time low earlier in the summer, but still far from where the overwhelmingly positive ratings other recent entries in the series sit. While not everyone’s facing issues, people on a range of machines are still reporting crashes, ugly textures, and unstable framerates even at 30fps.</p> <p>There’s currently a new Title Update 3 scheduled for September to add a new monster and more balance adjustments to combat and progression, followed by Title Update 4 in the winter. There’s also the game’s first expansion, which new <em>Monster Hunter</em> entries tend to get 12-18 months after they ship. It’ll be a make-or-break moment for the players on PC who feel like the last six months have been closer to an Early Access experience.</p>

<p>The Helldivers 2 collaboration with Halo ODST is confirmed to arrive on the same day as the Xbox launch in the form of a Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>Initially released as a PlayStation and PC exclusive in February 2024, Helldivers 2 finally launches on Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, alongside a Halo-themed Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>This marks the first Legendary Warbond to release in Helldivers 2, and while Halo has previously been a Microsoft exclusive, the Legendary Warbond is available on all platforms.</p>

<p>As announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond lands on August 26 at 5am PT/1pm BST.</p>



<p>The Warbond is packed full of rewards, with a price of 1500 Super Credits. While Arrowhead notes this is “a step up” from previous Warbond prices, it is “packed with gear worthy of the legend.”</p>



<p>In the Warbond, players can unlock two Armor Sets, three primary weapons and a pistol that Halo fans will instantly recognise, and Mean Green patterns for the FRV, Exo Suit, Shuttle, and Hellpod to provide a true Master Chief-inspired look.</p>



<p>Arrowhead adds that the Legendary Warbond is not compatible with the new Premium Warbond Token launching August 26, included in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042063885789827083/1044696485985517638/1407350534578372649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Citizen Edition</a>, and advise making sure your Super Credits are locked and loaded if you want to unlock the content.</p>



<p>The Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST collab continues the growing relationship between PlayStation and Xbox, which has seen Microsoft release first-party exclusives on the rival console, while PlayStation has started to reciprocate with Helldivers 2 and Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
