            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US sales analysis group Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for 2024 as a whole, and you'll never guess which of the year's biggest releases topped the charts.</p>

<p>As ever, this data comes from Circana's Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dhbzzk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and it crowns none other than&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>as the year's best-selling title.</p>

<p>That's not surprising given that Microsoft has called&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">the franchise's biggest yet</a>, but it will probably come as something of a relief given that the game was also made available <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">on Game Pass on day one</a>. Looks like that decision didn't do much to dampen its sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=dA1uCHGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=f442NDfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has, perhaps unsurprisingly, taken the crown of 2024's best-selling game in the US.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>'s performance will also doubtless come as a relief to Microsoft and Activision given how much the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">series' budgets appear to have ballooned</a> in recent years;&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>really is too big to fail, so it'll be reassuring that this one didn't.</p>

<p>In second place on the all-format sales chart, it's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which, again, won't come as much of a surprise given that the game recently swiped the crown of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">best-selling sports game in US history</a>.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>, which was sitting at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">12 million sales at last count</a>, takes third place, while the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>takes fourth place.&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is in fifth.</p>

<p>In terms of platform-specific charts, it's a tussle between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>for PlayStation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>topping <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbuyk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sony's chart</a> and&nbsp;<em>College Football&nbsp;</em>reaching number one on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dkxnp22n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft's</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=Bn96CzFP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=DUTTzKXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold remarkably well.</figcaption></figure><p>Since neither game was released on the Nintendo Switch, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>College Football 25&nbsp;</em>are completely absent from Nintendo's table.</p>

<p>Instead, it's topped by&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>taking up second place and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>in third.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>really is unstoppable, eh?</p>

<p>You can check out Piscatella's full Bluesky thread, which begins with data specific to December 2024 then widens up to encapsulate the whole year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. As always, it's worth a look if you're a numbers nerd!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nods-lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed-by-a-month.1089879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't Nod has delayed the second part of upcoming adventure game <i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i>. The game's second chapter is now set to launch around a month later than its originally-intended release date.</p>

<p>In an FAQ answering questions about&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don't Nod says the delay was put into effect in order to give the devs time to "refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling". It sounds like the usual delay reasoning, by and large.</p>

<p>The studio says that it's "confident" the delay will allow it to "provide you with a richer experience", and that it has "a little something up [its sleeve] on social media to keep you entertained in the time between the two Tapes" (i.e. chapters).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=MXcUjlpo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=v_Hv5wXx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>'s second part will be delayed by around a month.</figcaption></figure><p>The second part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, which is also known as "Rage",&nbsp;is now set to arrive on April 15th. This delay won't affect the first part (also known, surprisingly enough, as "Bloom"), which is still set to launch on February 18th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>is, Don't Nod's FAQ explains it pretty succinctly: it's a "single-player experience focused on narrative exploration" that revolves around four friends confronting the dark secrets of something that happened to them 27 years ago.</p>

<p>You'll be able to navigate between the 1995 and 2022 timelines and "shape both narratives" as you go, uncovering the truth of the sleepy Michigan town of Velvet Cove and what may or may not lie beneath its surface (spoilers, though: something definitely does).</p>




<p>This isn't the first time the game has been delayed in some form or another. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>was originally set for release in 2024, but back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Don't Nod pushed its launch back to 2025.</p>

<p>The studio will no doubt be banking on&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>' success for two reasons: to offset the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">recent underperformance</a> of some of its games and to launch what is supposed to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-by-life-is-strange-devs-is-first-game-in-much-larger" rel="nofollow">wider universe of interconnected media</a>.</p>

<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first part is due to arrive on February 18th, and the second will be released on April 15th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/celeste-devs-cancel-next-game-earthblade-due-to-studio-disagreement.1089843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Celeste&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Towerfall&nbsp;</em>studio Extremely OK Games has revealed that its ambitious Metroidvania platformer&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled owing to an internal studio dispute.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EXOK website titled "Final&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>Update" (just in case you weren't absolutely sure the game was done), the studio describes the cancellation as "a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". EXOK head Maddy Thorson says the decision to cancel was actually made in December.</p>

<p>According to Thorson, a "fracture" began forming in 2024, with her and coworker Noel Berry on one side and art director Pedro Medeiros on another. Specifically, the dispute revolved around "the IP rights of&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>", and it's a dispute Thorson says she "won't be detailing publicly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=VVIxJQhI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=MB3WBn6G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ambitious-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>The dispute, which Thorson calls "a very difficult and heartbreaking process", was eventually resolved, but she and Berry eventually agreed to go their separate ways with Medeiros, who originally announced his departure from EXOK <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Thorson says that the dispute with Medeiros caused her and Berry to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>and ask themselves whether continuing its development would be "worth the pain". Together, they concluded that working on the game had become "exhausting", leading them to "admit defeat".</p>

<p>She also goes on to say that fans shouldn't blame Medeiros, and that he and the team on his game&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>"aren't the enemy". Treating them as such will make you unwelcome "in any EXOK community", she says.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it was an exploration-based action platformer that would have offered "seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart".</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-revealed-as-new-game-from-celeste-developers" rel="nofollow">revealed in 2021</a>, EXOK announced in early 2024 that&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/celeste-creator-earthblade-delayed" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming out that year</a>. It's very likely the studio had already begun to grapple with the problems that would cause the game's cancellation even then.</p>

<p>As for what's next for EXOK, Thorson says the goal now is to "wipe the slate clean" and to "refocus...back to smaller-scale projects". We'll have to wait and see where that goes in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> recently celebrated its first anniversary, and to mark the occasion developer Pocketpair outlined its plans for the game's second year, with a roadmap that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">co-op crossplay and an "ending scenario"</a>.</p>
<p>But, why add an 'ending' now? Could it be because of Nintendo's impending legal action against the game? Well, Pocketpair community manager John "Bucky" Buckley tells Eurogamer this 'ending' has actually been "mapped out for quite some time" - and even though it is on its way, it certainly doesn't mean this is 'the end' of Palworld.</p>

<p>"The World Tree, where the 'ending' takes place, has been visible since day one," Bucky tells me. "Many players suspected their journey would end there, and we've been asked repeatedly about when the World Tree will become available so we're pretty excited to finally be opening the area up for players!"</p>
<p>Bucky admits "ending" may not actually be the best way to phrase things, but says he "can't think of a better one" right now.</p>
<p>"While the World Tree will mark the conclusion of this particular journey, it's by no means the end of Palworld," he assures.</p>
<p>As for what else is still to come in Palworld, Bucky promises "exciting things" in the pipeline. "We might have announced the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration a bit prematurely," he admits, "but everyone, including Re-Logic, was so excited that we thought it'd be fun to share early!"</p>
<p>Pocketpair remains "really excited about the direction [its] headed", Bucky continued, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Pocketpair's newly-announced publishing division</a> "which aims to fund and support developers in creating cool games".</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, Palworld's first year has not been without its challenges.</p>
<p>"There were so many challenges, to be honest," he tells me. "Pre-launch, we started gaining traction online, which was new for us and brought its own difficulties. Post-launch, we faced server problems, bug reporting issues, countless accusations... It was a lot to handle.</p>
<p>"While those issues haven't entirely gone away, they've definitely become more manageable."</p>
<p>Those accusations mostly came with a Pokémon-flavoured edge to them. Before the game was released in early access last January, many dubbed it 'Pokémon with guns' due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-hides-an-unreleased-familiar-looking-pal-creature-in-its-code-fan-says">familiar designs of some Palworld creatures</a> and some in-game mechanics. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>

<p>So, what has the team learned from the last 12 months? After all, no one - even Bucky - expected Palworld to take off quite as much as it did. As a reminder, Palworld became the first big mega-hit of 2024, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam last January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p><p>"As a company, we've learned how to structure our processes better," Bucky tells me. "People often forget that Pocketpair is quite a small team. The methods we've used for our previous games worked well, but Palworld put a spotlight on both our weaknesses and strengths. This year really brought the team together and made us more effective in our workflows."</p>
<p>But, for Bucky personally, he now appreciates the "importance of asking for advice and help as soon as possible" adding: "There are so many incredibly knowledgeable people in this industry."</p>

			<p>Despite being a pretty big fan of the Disgaea franchise, I’ve never dabbled in the other strategy RPG releases that team has concocted over the years. Nippon Ichi Software has a massive catalogue of different titles to dig into, though, which also makes it so surprising that it took this long for the company to put out a sequel to something other than Disgaea. It’s been over twenty years since the original Phantom Brave came out, having been ported and remastered a few different times since that initial release. For a select group of dedicated fans, Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the chance to finally experience a new adventure in this world. As someone who never played the original, though, I was equal parts excited and cautious to see how much this game would differentiate itself from that far-too-familiar Disgaea formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero – Gameplay Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Knv_DXvub0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was also definitely concerned that hopping into the sequel to a game I never played would leave me with more questions than answers, but Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is incredibly easy to dig into as a newcomer. For one thing, the game’s intro does a good job of quickly introducing you to series protagonists Marona and Ash – a young girl who has the special ability to see and communicate with phantoms – and a phantom named Ash who has sworn to protect her at all costs. Very soon after introducing them to you, though, Marona and Ash are separated due to a mysterious attack, with Marona waking up on an unfamiliar island all alone. She soon meets a lonely Phantom girl named Apricot, whose father was the leader of a massive pirate crew before going missing. Tangled up with Apricot and searching for Ash, Marona ends up involved in a web of swashbuckling adventures as she sets out to help her new friend and find her old one.</p>


<p>I appreciated the way Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero balances the tone of it’s writing. I’ve come to expect zany, fourth-wall-breaking anime shenanigans from Nippon Ichi Software, but there’s a somewhat softer and more heartfelt vibe to this game. There are still silly jokes and weird characters, and literally every time Apricot is on screen I can’t help but laugh at how anxious and overwhelmed her portrait art looks. The themes of loss and death and family run deep in this game, though, and I appreciated that the macabre of it all isn’t entirely ignored – there’s a constant clash with the fact that you’re going on silly fun adventures with ghosts and then being reminded that these fun new friends are ghosts and have died, and the game takes the time to explore and unpack all of that in a way I really appreciated.</p>


<p>Phantoms aren’t just a thing for the sake of silly ghost jokes, though. Their existence (or lack thereof) is a major element of the combat in Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero. Battles take place in small SRPG style maps, but with the familiar square-grid movement replaced with full dynamic movement around the map within a certain range. Protagonist Marona can’t do much by herself in any of these maps, though – but using her Phantom abilities, she can confine the ghostly friends in her party into any object on the map to give them a physical form. A Phantom who gets confined to an object will also get buffs or stat modifiers or new abilities depending on the object.</p>
<p>It’s a simple concept that quickly expands out in an overwhelming amount of ways. Some objects are linked thematically, and Phantoms confined to linked objects share those linked stats. Some characters can summon weapons and mechs called Gadgets that you can confine into to unlock extra attacks. Marona can even use Confriend to fuse with a Phantom on the field, changing her character model and giving her a few turns of ultra-powered action. The depth of the Phantom system is really impressive, and combined with the free movement it creates an entirely different battle flow and priority focus than in usual SRPGs. Positioning is key, but now so is environmental item awareness and managing your Phantoms time on the field efficiently.</p>

<p>It took a long time for the battles in Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero to feel less overwhelming and more open-ended. In part, the way the game tutorializes and introduces you to the various mechanics at your disposal leaves a lot to be desired – the official English website for the game has a better on-boarding tutorial for the combat system than the game itself. Once things settled in and started to click though, it was so satisfying to almost stumble accidentally into really effective and surprising strategies. In one instance, I had a barehanded Phantom near a strong enemy, and thought to throw a powerful weapon from one of my allies to that unequipped Phantom – and it worked, letting me equip that thrown weapon onto them and deal with that enemy instantly.</p>
<p>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero does an excellent job of differentiating itself from the vibe and mechanics that the Disgaea franchise has made so familiar. It asks a lot of you in the beginning, but once you wrap your mind around it all, this ends up being one of the most inventive and original strategy RPGs I’ve ever played.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-expands-mod-support-for-baldurs-gate-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-expands-mod-support-for-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3.1089807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-expands-mod-support-for-baldurs-gate-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced a collaboration with Larian Studios and mod.io to expand mod support for Baldur's Gate 3 on GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>As you will likely remember, the cRPG added built-in cross-platform mod support thanks to mod.io. Baldur's Gate 3 mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods-expand-party-size-unlock-level-cap-add-spells-feats-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been a thing on PC</a> even during the early access phase thanks to the old-fashioned way, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since last September</a>, there has been an official modding tool and a mod manager available within the game that players can access.</p>
<p>Thanks to the aforementioned partnership, GeForce NOW users subscribed to the Ultimate and Performance tiers can now download the mods via the in-game menu and keep them enabled across sessions, which is obviously the biggest problem with cloud gaming since you always get a different remote PC when logging in for a new session. Alternatively, GFN users may subscribe to the mods via mod.io to load them automatically when launching the game from GeForce NOW. Not all mods will be available at first; it will start with mods that have been curated for consoles. However, NVIDIA said to stay tuned for expanded support coming specifically for the game's PC mods in the future.</p>
<p>Improved support for mods and add-ons appears to be a long-term goal for NVIDIA with GeForce NOW. A while ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-world-of-warcraft-addons-to-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added support for World of Warcraft add-ons</a>. We'll see if this trend continues with other PC games.</p>

<p>While this is Pocketpair's first publishing signing, it won't be the studio's last; the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dev tells fans to "look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects", so we're going to be seeing more Pocketpair-published games in future.</p>

<p>Pocketpair pledges not to tell indie developers "what to do", not to "take control" from them during the making of their games, and not to "change [their] dream or push [them] to make a certain type of game".</p>

<p>Instead, the studio simply wants to "give [developers] money" and "help [them] make a fun game". That sounds nice and simple to me, although it's notable that Pocketpair doesn't disclose the share it'll take of developers' revenue or other terms along those lines.</p>

<p>As for the next Surgent project, studio head Abubakar Salim says that it won't be set in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>universe and that it will be based around "a pattern in the entertainment industry". It'll also be "short and weird", according to Salim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=IG_TiTGZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=U7WO8bcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll likely see more Pocketpair Publishing projects in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a nice redemption story for Surgent Studios; back in October, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow">put its team "on notice for redundancy"</a>&nbsp;following the underperformance of the game (although we now know it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">not the only EA-published game</a> to have underperformed in recent months).</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while to see what Surgent's next project looks like, and we don't know whether Pocketpair will indeed be publishing more games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera&nbsp;</em>universe, but for now, it looks like Surgent has been granted a reprieve. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update finally has a release date, and it's coming just a day before the game's next major expansion set arrives.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the trading update, which will allow you to trade cards with your friends (albeit with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-details" rel="nofollow">pretty hefty caveats</a>), will arrive on January 29th, which is next Wednesday at time of writing.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the trading update will only let you trade with friends, and only certain cards will be supported to begin with. Additionally, you'll only be able to trade cards of certain rarity levels, and new items will need to be used in order to facilitate trades.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=EqhDLw6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=Ls5PaGcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion will bring plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you'll only be able to trade cards from the first two sets as well, those being Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>. Plans are in place to introduce trading for other sets at a later date, apparently.</p>

<p>As for the new expansion, it's called&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown</em>, and as the name suggests, it'll largely revolve around two of the Sinnoh region's pivotal legendary Pokemon, namely Dialga and Palkia. The new booster packs will be themed around those Pokemon as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new Pokemon from Sinnoh that haven't appeared in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>before; The Pokemon Company is teasing Lucario and the three Sinnoh starters (Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup), but there will likely be others, too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the new set also teases a Pachirisu ex card that includes attack text referring to Pokemon Tools, a mechanic from the main&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>game that can augment certain 'mon attacks. Sounds like they'll be making their debut with this set as well.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update launches on January 29th, and the&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion set launches a day later on January 30th. Make sure you're ready for both!</p>

It seems as if there will be cooldown periods as well as a cost if you want to swap cards from Pocket’s Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets with other players. But there will <em>definitely </em>be some waiting involved for people hoping to trade Space-Time Smackdown, which will not be tradeable until a later date after it drops on January 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review-a-new-king-of-4k-is-here.1089789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Nvidia’s RTX 4090 was a beast of a graphics card. It was a huge GPU that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">delivered true 4K gaming</a> for those who really wanted it and a huge jump in performance over the previous-generation RTX 3090. Naturally, the company’s latest top-of-the-line GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, now has a lot of expectations riding on it when it arrives on January 30th.</p><p>But at $1,999, the RTX 5090 is steep — $400 more than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition at its launch. (It could run you even more in the form of a new power supply or higher electricity bills, especially if you want to run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in 4K.) </p><p>For those extra dollars, you’re getting hardware improvements in the form of 32GB of VRAM and a redesigned Founders Edition card that’s shrunk down enough to fit inside a small form factor PC. But the greatest benefit might actually be in the software: the RTX 5090 is the first Nvidia GPU with access to the new DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, which promises huge frame rate increases. We’re talking frame rates not just quadrupling but increasing by more than 8x in some cases.</p><p>That extra processing power naturally translates to better performance, making the RTX 5090 the new king of 4K gaming. It’s a $1,999 GPU for anyone who wants the best 4K gaming experience, developers interested in AI performance, and creators who want to accelerate video editing. </p><p>But the RTX 5090 isn’t as big an improvement over the RTX 4090 as that previous-generation card was over the RTX 3090, especially in games that don’t yet support DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen. While it’s still a little too early to tell how widely developers will adopt Nvidia’s latest DLSS tech, I think it may turn out to be a lot more important than the actual hardware itself.</p><p><h3><strong>Hardware</strong></h3></p><p>When I first unboxed the RTX 5090, I was surprised at how small the Founders Edition card was. Although the new GPU is still as long and wide as an RTX 4090, it’s nowhere near as thick. Where the 4090 Founders Edition took up three slots and then some, the two-slot 5090 is so slim it will fit inside small form factor PCs, giving people much more flexibility this time around.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Nvidia has moved to three DisplayPort 2.1b ports and a single HDMI 2.1b port at the rear.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The angled power connector on the RTX 5090.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s power dongle for the RTX 5090 includes four regular PCIe eight-pin power connectors.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The key to the two-slot design is a new cooling system. For the Founders Edition card, Nvidia moved to double flowthrough fans that suck cooler air from below and exhaust it above the RTX 5090 into the rest of the case, rather than out the top and back of the card. The PCB moves to the center of the card, with heat pipes going out in both directions that get cool air from this new fan layout.</p><p>The RTX 5090’s power connector is slightly angled to make it easier to fit into cases where the side panel comes close to touching the GPU power cable. Nvidia bundles a dongle power adapter that uses four regular PCIe eight-pin power connectors, much like the adapter for the RTX 4090, though the cables are slightly more flexible this time. This new GPU supports an updated 12V-2x6 connector that has shorter sensing pins and slightly longer conductor terminals, but existing 12VHPWR connectors will work fine with the RTX 5090, so you don’t need to swap anything for a new cable.</p><p>Nvidia recommends a 1,000-watt power supply because the RTX 5090 can draw a massive 575 watts of power — 125W more than the RTX 4090. The 12VHPWR cables are rated at 600 watts, so there’s little room for overclocking. I was hoping that Nvidia’s RTX 50 series would focus more on efficiency rather than push the power draw even higher, especially as the RTX 4090 was already a big jump from the 350W RTX 3090. It’s disappointing that power draw in flagship GPUs has essentially reached the level of what a single cable can deliver, and I sure hope whatever comes next doesn’t require two 12VHPWR cables.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5090 is a lot smaller than the RTX 4090.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3><strong>4K and DLSS 4</strong></h3></p><p>For both my 4K and 1440p testing, I’ve paired Nvidia’s RTX 5090 with AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP monitor. That monitor is the perfect companion for the RTX 5090: the 240Hz refresh rate is more than sufficient for the frame rates the card can achieve at 1440p, and games look fantastic on an OLED panel with HDR enabled.</p><p>I’ve put the RTX 5090 head-to-head with the RTX 4090 and AMD’s closest competitor, the RX 7900 XTX, to see how Nvidia’s latest <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5090%2F">Blackwell architecture</a> — which is a combination of hardware and software support improvements — performs across a variety of games. I’ve tested the latest titles like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, and some of the usual choices like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em>, and even <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</em></p><p>These games were all tested at very high or ultra settings on the RTX 5090, with a variety of ray tracing and upscaling options in games that support them, as well as games without DLSS or ray-tracing support.</p><div><p>Test machine:</p><div><ul><li>CPU cooler: Corsair H150i Elite LCD</li><li>Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Master</li><li>RAM: 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</li><li>Storage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</li><li>PSU: Corsair HX1000W</li><li>Case: Streacom BC1 V2 open benchtable</li></ul></div></div><p>The star of the 4K show here is DLSS 4 and Nvidia’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Multi Frame Generation</a> technique that can generate up to three additional frames per every traditionally rendered frame. It uses the latest AI graphics models, powered by an updated transformer architecture that’s similar to what’s found in ChatGPT to multiply frame rates beyond what a GPU is normally capable of. Essentially, the Tensor cores in the GPU take the rendered frame, figure out what the next one to three frames <em>should</em> look like, generate them, and insert them before the next rendered frame. It’s how Nvidia can promise big frame rate increases in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 4K with full ray tracing enabled.</p><p>Nvidia is really selling the RTX 50-series on this new Multi Frame Gen technology as a result, and some of its marketing has already reignited the long-running <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">“fake frames” argument</a> about DLSS Frame Generation. Some PC gamers have argued that this technique, which Nvidia introduced originally with DLSS 3, is not reflective of the true performance of GPUs.</p><p>I think this debate will run for the entirety of this generation of GPUs, but with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344212/nvidias-dlss-is-surprisingly-popular">more than 80 percent</a> of RTX owners enabling DLSS in games already, they’re likely to move to Frame Generation if they upgrade to the latest Nvidia cards.</p><p>Most of the real issues with DLSS Frame Generation come down to the impact of latency and image quality. Instead of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model used in previous versions of DLSS, Nvidia has <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations%2F">switched to a new transformer model for DLSS 4</a>. This means frame generation models are faster and use less VRAM. The switch also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338303/digital-foundry-got-a-first-look-at-dlss-4-on-an-rtx-5080">fixes some of the image ghosting</a> and weird artifacts we’ve seen in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and it does all of this while massively improving frame rates with Multi Frame Gen and only adding a minuscule 6ms more latency.&nbsp;</p><p>That feels like a good tradeoff to me, but Multi Frame Generation works best when the frame rate after Super Resolution upscaling is already decent. Super Resolution is another DLSS feature that helps improve frame rates and reduce input latency by rendering at a lower resolution and using AI to upscale to the output resolution. For example, a game that would render at 27fps in 4K with DLSS turned off might play at 60fps with Super Resolution. Multi Frame Generation can bump that to 200fps and greatly improve the motion clarity, but it will still <em>feel </em>like 60fps because it’s not the same as the reduced input latency benefits that 200fps rendered traditionally would deliver.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Multi Frame Gen massively improves frame rates in </em>Cyberpunk 2077<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Nvidia supplied early DLSS 4-compatible builds of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>for testing, and I focused most of my Multi Frame Gen testing on <em>Cyberpunk 2077. </em>While the game is over four years old, developer CD Projekt Red still manages to add the latest upscaling and ray-tracing techniques into <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a regular basis, pushing modern GPUs to the max to get path tracing running. That makes it a popular choice for benchmarking and image analysis.</p><p>At 4K resolution, with full path tracing, ultra settings, and no DLSS upscaling or frame generation, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> ran at just 34fps. That’s nearly 42 percent faster than an RTX 4090, but you really need Super Resolution and Multi Frame Generation here to help the game get way above 60fps with everything cranked up. That shows you how important software improvements have become in modern GPUs, and while DLSS 4 won’t settle the debate about “fake frames,” the improvement it brings is undeniable.</p><p>You can also choose from 2x Multi Frame Gen (DLSS 3 Frame Generation) all the way up to 4x Multi Frame Gen. I took the 34fps fully path traced version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to a massive 371fps with DLSS ultra performance, 4x Multi Frame Gen, and the CNN model. If you opt for the Transformer model, you can avoid the image ghosting issues of CNN and still get 211fps at DLSS quality mode and 4x Multi Frame Gen, without needing to drop down to the DLSS performance modes that offer less image quality. That’s more than six times the base 34fps. I think it’s worth the very small performance tradeoff to stick to Transformer in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of my 4K testing was performed without DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen, simply because most developers haven’t updated their games yet. While the company is promising more than 75 games and apps will upgrade to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen when the RTX 5090 launches on January 30th, some, like <em>Black Myth: Wukong,</em> won’t be upgraded until later this year. If you really can’t wait for developers to update their games, there will be an option to force DLSS Multi Frame Gen inside games through the Nvidia app.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->9</p><p><figcaption><em>FSR 2 does a good job of lifting framerates with the RTX 5090 in Assassin’s Creed Mirage.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Still, not everything here is about software improvements. Without DLSS or Frame Gen involved, the RTX 5090 was, on average, 28 percent faster than the RTX 4090 at 4K. That’s still nowhere near as big of a jump as I saw between the last two RTX generations, but it’s better than the RTX 5090 is capable of at 1440p.</p><p>The RTX 5090 managed more than 60fps at 4K in every game I tested, with <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> being the most demanding at 62fps on the RTX 5090 compared to 47fps on the RTX 4090. DLSS managed to bump this up to 95fps without Frame Gen involved.</p><p>I saw the biggest performance improvements in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 4K, with the RTX 5090 delivering 43 percent higher frame rates over the RTX 4090 at ultra settings without DLSS or ray tracing involved. If you compare the RTX 5090 to AMD’s $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX, then the performance gap is a massive 70 percent but at double the price.</p><p><em>Forza Motorsport </em>also ran 35 percent better on the RTX 5090 than the RTX 4090 using temporal anti-aliasing (TAA), and I even managed to hit 238fps on average in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 4K on the RTX 5090.</p><p>I also ran some AI and video workloads on the RTX 5090 just to get a taste for what it’s capable of over the RTX 4090. The RTX 5090 was around 12 percent faster than the RTX 4090 in PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve test, and in Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test, it was 40 percent faster.&nbsp;</p><p><h3><strong>1440p benchmarks</strong></h3></p><p>At 1440p resolution, the RTX doesn’t deliver as much of a performance benefit as at 4K. <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is one of the more demanding PC games right now, and it’s the only one where the RTX 5090 failed to deliver more than 100fps at 1440p without the help of FSR or DLSS. Enabling DLSS at 75 percent in <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>bumped the RTX 5090 performance to nearly 120fps —&nbsp;closer to making use of a 144Hz monitor — but it’s only 17 percent more than the RTX 4090.</p><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> averaged 200fps on the RTX 5090 with very high settings and just TAA enabled. That’s only 13 percent more than the RTX 4090 managed with the same settings. <em>Returnal</em> also ran 19 percent faster without DLSS on the RTX 5090 than the RTX 4090, and it’s a similar story in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, where the RTX 5090 reached nearly 200fps without DLSS, about 15 percent more than the RTX 4090 delivered.&nbsp;</p><p>The most disappointing result was <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage,</em> where the RTX 5090 only managed 8 percent better performance than the RTX 4090.&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->9</p><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5090 nearly maxes out a 240Hz monitor in Assassin’s Creed Mirage with FSR upscaling.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> are rare examples of the RTX 5090 delivering more than a 30 percent performance gain over the RTX 4090 at 1440p. Without DLSS enabled, the RTX 5090’s lead over the 4090 at 1440p is about 18 percent on average — a lower jump overall than the last generation, which saw the RTX 4090 beating the RTX 3090 by over 40 percent in multiple titles.</p><p>DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Gen feature will obviously help out at 1440p, too, but out of my test suite of games, only <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> had support for it ahead of launch, so I focused my Multi Frame Gen testing at 4K.</p><p>At $1,999, I don’t think many people will be picking up an RTX 5090 just for 1440p, but if you’re considering it, then it might be worth seeing how the upcoming RTX 5080 performs at this resolution.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5090’s fans cool down this card when you’re pushing it to the limits.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3><strong>Power draw, fans, and heat</strong></h3></p><p>While DLSS Multi Frame Gen is showing promising early results, I’ve been far less impressed with the RTX 5090’s power draw. I managed to get it to peak at 578 watts during a 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme 4K benchmark. Even in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with full ray tracing and no DLSS, it peaked at 569 watts and hovered regularly above 500 watts. The same test on the RTX 4090 peaked at 427 watts. The extra power draw is really disappointing from this generation — I was hoping for a lot more efficiency from Nvidia’s latest chips.</p><p>Even without ray tracing in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the RTX 5090 averages 477 watts of power draw. Power consumption will vary by game, but in titles where you’re really pushing it, it’s going to want 500 watts or more. I was hoping for more efficiency here and for the RTX 5090 to draw less power than the previous generation in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. In something like <em>Valorant, </em>it’s obviously going to draw less than 200 watts, but most non-pros aren’t spending $1,999 on a GPU just to play esports titles.</p><p>You’ll want to invest in at least a 1,000-watt power supply for the RTX 5090 or even beyond that to give you room for future upgrades. This extra power draw will also have an impact on your electricity bills, particularly if you’re in a country like the UK where utility prices have skyrocketed in recent years.</p><p>While the power draw is disappointing, at least I didn’t notice any immediate heat issues during my testing of the RTX 5090. It hit a maximum of 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) in an open test bench, with the fans reaching 1,500rpm during the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> testing. The RTX 4090 hit 64C in the same test. The RTX 5090 is a relatively quiet card, and it still has a zero-rpm mode like the previous RTX 4090, where the fans stop spinning when you’re idle or not touching the GPU much. It can get as high as 50C (122F) while idle in this zero-rpm mode, though, and then the fans kick in again to cool the card down to a more reasonable 30C (86F) idle temperature. I don’t have a small form factor case to test the RTX 5090, but I’d imagine you’ll have to think carefully about cooling in a more enclosed case.</p><p>I haven’t run into many issues with the RTX 5090, but I did notice a few games crashing randomly on the pre-release drivers. <em>Valorant </em>often fails to launch or just crashes before a game begins. <em>The Finals</em> refuses to load, with an error that appears to be anti-cheat related. I don’t recall similar issues with previous generations of Nvidia GPUs, but there could be other games that also crash or refuse to run with the RTX 5090 until developers and Nvidia fix the early issues.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The RTX 5090 is a flagship GPU unlike any other.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The RTX 5090 is undoubtedly a 4K king, but Nvidia hasn’t delivered the pure performance gains here like it did with the RTX 4090. While DLSS 4 is a boost to both image quality and Frame Generation performance that can’t be ignored, I haven’t seen enough of Multi Frame Gen across a variety of games to know how well it works in every situation. The early look at <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is promising for the RTX 50 series, as long as other developers can deliver similar performance gains without additional latency or issues along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you should never buy something hoping that software improves it over time, but Nvidia has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998119/nvidia-is-still-celebrating-its-rtx-milestone">proven with DLSS</a> in the past that its GPUs certainly do get better with age. I’m willing to bet that DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen will improve a lot more games running on the RTX 50 series like it did with these early examples. DLSS 4 and its new transformer model are also <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAnd%2520on%2520all%2520GeForce%2520RTX%2520GPUs%252C%2520DLSS%2520games%2520with%2520Ray%2520Reconstruction%252C%2520Super%2520Resolution%252C%2520and%2520DLAA%2520can%2520be%2520upgraded%2520to%2520the%2520new%2520DLSS%2520transformer%2520model.">arriving on existing RTX cards</a> to improve image quality, and Nvidia has hinted we might even see Multi Frame Gen eventually appear on older generations.</p><p>$1,999 is still a lot to pay for a GPU, even if it’s no more than the RTX 4090 ended up selling for in reality. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like AMD will even bother competing with the RTX 5090, and it’s still not clear how its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025?">AI-powered FSR 4 upscaling</a> will compare to DLSS 4. Nvidia stands alone at the high end of the GPU market right now, and $1,999 is the price to unlock the best that PC gaming has to offer.</p><p>If this price or the power draw puts you off of the RTX 5090, Nvidia still has the $999 RTX 5080 on the way — and the $749 RTX 5070 Ti and $549 RTX 5070 in February. On a pure performance basis, the RTX 5090 isn’t a game-changer in the way the RTX 4090 was. But if enough developers adopt DLSS 4, then this sleek GPU might well usher us into an era where software improvements matter more than hardware alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Weeks of speculation and rumors have come to a head as we finally have confirmation of A2. Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new A2 Set is here—named Space-Time Smackdown—and we know its start date, which new cards are included, and much more.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-packs-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A2 Set</a> talk has come true, as expected. Pokémon TCG Pocket is introducing a new set to kick off 2025—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-expansion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a>. The funky-sounding name is apt (more on this later) and is a big step up compared to the mini-set-nature of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a>.</p>



<p>Genetic Apex has kept the app stocked with cards for a while, but it’s time for Space-Time Smackdown to shake up the meta and daily routine of opening Packs.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date">Pokémon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>Space-Time Smackdown first debuts in Pokémon TCG Pocket on Wednesday, January 29, followed by a global launch on Thursday, January 30.</strong></p>



<p>It’s likely a same-time rollout for Space-Time Smackdown. The key difference is New Zealand players get to experience the joy of the new set first because of the time difference—hence January 29. This is the way for virtually every game release, and Pocket is the same here.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-new-space-time-smackdown-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Every New Space-Time Smackdown Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>So far, we know of a few Pokémon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown Cards including <strong>Dialga ex, Palkia ex, a Lucario Full Art, Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/explore-pokemon-tcg-pockets-newest-expansion-space-time-smackdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the set has “<strong>Over 140 cards including exciting Pokémon ex cards, new Trainer cards, and gorgeous immersive cards ready to bring you into the wondrous world of Pokémon</strong>.”</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of every card revealed so far in the new Space-Time Smackdown set:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chimchar</li>



<li>Cresselia</li>



<li>Gible</li>



<li>Honchkrow</li>



<li>Leafeon</li>



<li>Piplup</li>



<li>Turtwig</li>



<li>Dialga ex</li>



<li>Pachirisu ex</li>



<li>Palkia ex</li>



<li>Cynthia (Full Art)</li>



<li>Lucario (Full Art)</li>
</ul>



<p>The debut trailer only gave away a small mackerel of cards. Another trailer close to launch—or a comprehensive leak—could tell us more. For now, we’ll take these cards, and you can see them for yourself in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Official Pokémon YouTube channel</a>‘s Space-Time Smackdown debut trailer!</p>

<h2 id="h-which-generation-is-pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-set">Which Generation is Pokémon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown Set?</h2>



<p><strong>The 4th Generation of Pokémon is the focus of Pocket’s Space-Time Smackdown A2 Set.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone—myself included—thought the second set would naturally follow the chronology of Pokémon. Genetic Apex was predominantly a Kanto set. It makes sense A2 would move on to Johto for the second set, but alas, this is not the case.</p>



<p>I’m pleasantly surprised as it means to <strong>expect the unexpected</strong>.</p>



<p>The development teams are going to mix things up and keep us on our toes. It also means we probably get some amazing Mon in Space-Time Smackdown: <strong>Infernape</strong>, <strong>Bidoof</strong>, <strong>Kricketot, Kricketune</strong>, <strong>Mismagius</strong>, <strong>Munchlax</strong>, <strong>Glaceon</strong>, and many more.</p>



<h2 id="h-trading-added-ahead-of-space-time-smackdown">Trading Added Ahead of Space-Time Smackdown</h2>



<p><strong>Trading arrives on January 28—the day before Space-Time Smackdown gets underway.</strong></p>



<p>It’ll already be in the game before the A2 Set Booster Packs launch; however, we’re glad to finally see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a>. Adding it the day before gives the team a chance to ensure it’s implemented properly before Space-Time Smackdown is live. You can also spend the last few hours swapping cards with friends to fill out decks before you have a new set to start over with.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m always giddy before a new event gets underway. I’ve got Hourglasses galore and all the resources ready to complete the Space-Time Smackdown set. Are you looking forward to it? Are you surprised to see Gen 4 as A2’s main focus?</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">People who are into games today generally know the term "walking sim." It seems to have cropped up around the time of Dear Esther in 2012, a first-person adventure game in which you explore the Scottish countryside on foot, triggering memories of your lost loved one. To be fair, the game <em>does</em> mostly involve walking around, but there was a time when calling a game a "walking sim" was meant by some as a dig against it. That was true of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dear-esther/" data-ref-id="5000-129153">Dear Esther</a> and many games since then. One would use it to say, "This game lacks gameplay." To an extent, that's not the case anymore, as walking sim is now a genre label on Steam so fans of them can easily find more, and many games are built to attract an audience that enjoys this kind of game.</p><p dir="ltr">I like them, too, though I've always had something of an asterisk attached to my enjoyment. They didn't work as horror games, despite many attempts. I find this pairing doesn't work because walking sims often exclude mechanics besides things like moving and triggering dialogue. You can tell a good story in a walking-sim horror game, but in my experience, you can't create a frightening game if I can easily peer through the game's code, figuratively speaking, to find that there are no monster encounters to worry about. The game isn't going to present me with any fail states, or at least not any elaborate situations in which I may or may not survive, which is where a horror story's tension originates.</p><p dir="ltr">Simply put, if it's clear the mechanics of a horror game won't advance past, more or less, moving around alone, then the setting itself has to effectively sell the scare factor. Typical horror games have not shown an ability to do that effectively or consistently, in my experience. This has ruined countless horror games for me over the years. But one new game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2453060/Dreamcore/" rel="nofollow">Dreamcore</a>, is helping solve it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432121-dreamcore2-7-20248-18-41pm-802.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432121-dreamcore2-7-20248-18-41pm-802.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432121"></a><figcaption>Liminal horror is like a cheat code for the horror-adventure genre.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432121-dreamcore2-7-20248-18-41pm-802.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dreamcore is a first-person "walking sim" horror game focused on liminal spaces and, a bit more specifically, the hazy, liminal-feeling worlds we often create in our dreams. Since 2020, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=liminal%20spaces&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">the liminal space genre has exploded online</a> in places like TikTok and YouTube, but also in video games. Liminal spaces are places, either real or invented, that express a feeling of liminality--a transitional space, often leading to a guttural sense of foreboding or worry.</p><p dir="ltr">Liminal spaces can feel unwelcoming, indecipherable, and out-of-time, like exploring the long-vacated remnants of a shopping mall, or they may instill that eerie feeling you might get when you're alone in a long, quiet hotel hallway where every door is identical (and maybe the carpet is a little too Shining-esque). These experiences don't affect everyone--in my home, my kids and I <em>love</em> going down liminal-space rabbit holes online, while my wife finds them totally unmoving. But for those who know the strangely alluring bad vibe they get from liminal spaces, there's now a huge community out there creating, sharing, and experiencing these places together, both in reality and fiction.</p><p dir="ltr">Dreamcore seeks to provide a similar experience as other recent genre hits such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pools/" data-ref-id="5000-608933">Pools</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-complex-expedition/" data-ref-id="5000-574146">The Complex</a>. They are walking sims at their heart, but they succeed where other similarly designed horror games often fail. Whereas a walking sim in a haunted house eventually has to put up or shut up regarding its threat of ghosts or demons lurking in the darkest corners of the home, a liminal space <em>is </em>the horror. More accurately, the intensity comes not from the setup and payoff of enemies to evade or fight, but the relentless feeling of complete unease that being in such a space elicits. It promises no monsters, no health bars, no chase sequences, and no fail-states. It is the exploration itself that is the horror, which makes walking, despite being the shallow limit to its gameplay mechanics, effective.</p><p dir="ltr">These places tap into something that seems to be lurking in my gut, and witnessing such spaces, real or virtual, brings it to the forefront. They feel like places I ought not to be and can't easily escape. It's been a refreshing and exciting feeling for me, as a lifelong horror fan, to find this busy subset of games coming out right now in which the mechanics are often only as deep as Dear Esther and yet the scare factor can often feel closer to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker/" data-ref-id="5000-577134">Amnesia</a>. That's something that I've only found in the liminal-horror space, and not for lack of trying many other versions of what I call horror-adventure games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432122-dreamcore2-7-20248-22-12pm-97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432122" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432122-dreamcore2-7-20248-22-12pm-97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432122"></a><figcaption>Dreamcore pulls from some of the most popular liminal space images online, like this one, often called the Liminal Space Hotel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432122-dreamcore2-7-20248-22-12pm-97.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Dreamcore's first of two worlds available today--more will be revealed and released later--you explore labyrinthine indoor pools, the likes of which genre devotees have maybe seen before. But even if you think you've seen this one before, I appreciate how far Dreamcore goes to achieve the vibe fans of liminal horror are searching for. There are puzzle elements to the game, built on paying close attention to the world even as you may sometimes feel you're going in circles, and there are even a few interesting Easter eggs I won't spoil.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no combat in Dreamcore, no monsters--for that, you'll want to explore another popular branch of liminal horror: The Backrooms. So why does it work so well as a walking sim? It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why that is. Maybe it's the disembodied jazz music that echoes out across the seemingly endless, perplexing pool rooms--or, just as scary is when that music ends and leaves you with only your thoughts and footsteps. Maybe it's the retro visual filter that gives it all the look of found footage from a 1990s camcorder, like you've found some kind of snuff film borne from REM sleep. Maybe it's the way no wall, doorway, pool, or swirly waterslide looks like it belongs, and you can't help but then wonder, what is it doing there? Who built it? Where is everyone? <em>What am I doing here?</em> Whatever it is, you'll sense it too when you play it.</p><p dir="ltr">Its second level is based on a popular segment of liminal horror lore online, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D41ej39njb8&amp;ab_channel=Valox">Level 94</a>. You may have seen images like it in movies such as Toys or Vivarium. An endless stretch of similarly shaped houses decorate rolling, green hills. Each home can be entered, but the objective of reaching the water tower and discovering its secret plays out like a lab rat in a maze, as doors lead out to fenced-in pathways that are always roundabout, never direct. It's purposely dizzying, and the juxtaposition of delicate, otherwise agreeable music with the world's surreal and uncanny atmosphere fills me with unease, but it's an unease I am somehow enchanted by, like a siren's song.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432124-capturadepantalla2024-07-15162257.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432124" data-ratio="0.55377008652658" data-width="1618" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432124-capturadepantalla2024-07-15162257.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432124"></a><figcaption>I know the neighborhood is vaguely threatening, but in this market, you've gotta take what you can get.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4432124-capturadepantalla2024-07-15162257.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Perhaps more than anything, what's so creepy and yet so exciting about liminal spaces and video games depicting them is their ability to keep us in a dreamlike state. Everyone wakes from their dreams and senses the memory of them withering away. By breakfast, it can be hard to recall any moment of what we invented in our minds the night before, and they always feel like they went on much longer than they did--in reality, dreams are micro-stories, unfolding in just a few minutes at a time.</p><p dir="ltr">But Dreamcore and the ever-expanding liminal horror genre give us a chance to stay asleep, in a sense. And when we can confront those disquietingly shaped rooms, impossible neighborhoods, and that feeling of unease that washes over us completely, it allows for a novel horror experience, and a walking sim that finally horrifies.</p>

            <p>Funselektor, the developer behind art of rally, has revealed a co-op off-road exploration game titled: over the hill.</p>
<p>"Explore the world in the golden age of offroading. Drive iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s by yourself or with friends through challenging trails and beautiful scenery," reads the official blurb. </p>
<p>Tow ropes may be required to get your fellow car enthusiasts out of a tight spot, if the announcement trailer (below) is anything to go by. It all looks a bit like a cosy take on a Top Gear challenges of old, obviously with a lot less yelling of "Poweeeer!" by the hosts, mixed with some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> elements.</p>

<p>The game's biomes have all been inspired by real locations, and while they can be explored with your friends by your side, you can also take to the road (or track) on your own if you just fancy a quiet drive to clear your head. Weather will change around you as the sun sets and night comes, with the developer promising a "dynamic, immersive experience" on over the hill's release. There will also be hidden objectives and challenges dotted around, so something to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p>"After  having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace," said Funselektor founder Dune Casu.</p>
<p>"In a way, this game is similar to the experience  I've had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There's something special  about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and  less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home."</p>
<p>If this all sounds like your thing, you can add over the hill to your wishlist on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released its preliminary financial report for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the company says that two of its biggest releases for the period underperformed.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, both&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>were financial disappointments for EA, with CEO Andrew Wilson confirming that both games "underperformed our net bookings expectations", which is essentially a fancy way of saying they undersold.</p>

<p>As a result of both games' failures, EA says it's revising its outlook for the year, predicting a "mid-single-digit decline" and pinning most of the blame for that decline on&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-5v5-rush.jpg?itok=eEUGKwf1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-5v5-rush.jpg?itok=qrgXnlc9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says two of its flagship games underperformed in the last quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>EA doesn't specify how far&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>fell below its expectations, but the company does say that the game put an end to "two consecutive fiscal years of double-digit net bookings growth" for football (sorry, Americans) games.</p>

<p>Apparently, the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>franchise "experienced a slowdown" as early momentum gathered at the start of the quarter "did not sustain through to the end". As a reminder, the quarter runs from September through December, and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>launched on September 27th.</p>

<p>Separately, EA says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>"engaged approximately 1.5 million players" during the period, which presumably means that's how many copies it sold. EA was expecting the game to sell somewhere in the region of three million copies in the same time period.</p>

<p>Wilson says he and his company "remain confident in our long-term strategy" and that EA expects to return to growth in the next financial year. CFO Stuart Canfield agrees, pointing to EA launching "more of [its] iconic franchises" next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-sales-disappointing-combat.jpg?itok=9s7C-NLz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-sales-disappointing-combat.jpg?itok=wqIMXF1k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>didn't do the kind of numbers EA was hoping for.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's unlikely that the underperformance of these games will reflect poorly on what will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">inevitably be another massive bonus</a> for Wilson this year.</p>

<p>Instead, I wouldn't be surprised if devs across BioWare and EA's&nbsp;<em>Sports FC&nbsp;</em>teams were laid off in the coming months.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">left BioWare last week</a>, although it's unclear whether or not that decision was related to the game's disappointing sales.</p>

<p>As for the reasons both games underperformed, it's hard to say. Wilson and EA don't speculate, but&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>has attracted its fair share of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ea-sports-fc-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player vitriol</a> in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2669320/EA_SPORTS_FC_25/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user reviews</a> online (although very few&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>games in the last few years haven't).</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, criticism has been aimed at the game's writing and storytelling, as well as other elements, although for what it's worth, our own reviewer Erren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-veilguard-review-homecoming" rel="nofollow">looked more kindly on the game</a> than some did.</p>

            <p>In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lili">Lili</a> looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telling-lies">Telling Lies</a>. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Lili will plunge you into a stylized vision of modern Iran, where surveillance and authoritarianism are part of daily life," said the RSC in <a href="https://www.rsc.org.uk/news/macbeth-inspired-video-game-lili">a press release</a>. "The gameplay will feature a blend of live-action cinema within an interactive game format, so you can immerse yourself in the world of Lady Macbeth and make choices that influence her destiny."</p>
<p>Yep, that sounds very much like the work of Half Mermaid. But in this case the game is being co-created with New York studio iNK Stories, who made the Telltale-esque adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/1979-revolution-black-friday">1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a>. In that historical adventure you play a young photographer caught up in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-1979-revolution-black-friday">the dangerous winds of the Iranian revolution</a>. As far as choosing a studio to work with, it's a sensible match.</p>
<p>The game will star Zar Amir, who played the lead role as an investigative journalist in 2022 crime thriller Holy Spider. I haven't seen it, but the performance was good enough to win her an award at Cannes. The actor will be "drawing on her lived experience as an Iranian woman in exile who has courageously confronted her own battles against authoritarian gendered oppression," say the RSC. The game is due to "enter production in late 2025" , they say. </p><p>There's no shortage of snoop 'em ups that use a fictional OS as a way to get the player to trawl through a mystery. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orwell">Orwell</a> saw you investigating people as an agent of the state. The more light-hearted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> had you policing an alternate history internet of spinning GIFs and personal blogs. And of course Telling Lies saw you scrobbling through old video calls to make sense of the lives of four strangers and how they're related. But Lili is probably the first to use the same vehicle to retell a Shakespeare play. As the bard famously said: "I shall wishlist thee when thee drops on Steam."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the years since the Switch was released, that gap has only grown with the release of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. We still don’t have official specs for the Switch 2, but it will likely be a decent leap forward for Nintendo’s line of handheld/console hybrids. As such, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see some older games make their way to the device that couldn’t feasibly run on the original, so we got to thinking about some big games that we’d like to see ported to the Switch 2. Here are a few of our ideas. </p></div><div><p>Leading the pack is the remastered collection that I was hoping and pleading would end up on the original Switch when it was released in 2021. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em></a></span><em> </em>combines three landmark RPGs into one package and would be an excellent addition to the Switch 2 line-up.

The series has pretty consistently landed on Nintendo’s platforms in the past, so <em>Sparking! Zero</em> is an odd outlier. The only reason I can think of is Bandai Namco aiming for an early Switch 2 release date. I’m not one to make bets, especially not two in the same article, but I’m betting again that <em>Sparking! Zero </em>makes an appearance at a Nintendo showcase at some point this year.</p></div><div><p>I had forgotten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span><em> </em>launched on the PS4 and, from what I can tell, runs pretty well, so it’s not a stretch to hope it might be great on the Switch 2, too. Given that Capcom is still supporting the incredible fighter with new characters, this feels like another reasonable port from Capcom.</p></div><div><p>Incredible games like the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, and <em>Control</em> are all playable on Switch, kinda: if you’ve got a fast and stable internet connection, you can play them through the cloud, but it doesn’t live up to the experience of playing them natively on other platforms. Maybe with the Switch 2’s more powerful hardware, we’ll see some of those games make their way to the device in ports that feel as good to play as these games should..</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>both started out as PlayStation exclusives, but now they’re on PC, so they’re probably fair game for the Switch 2. Depending on the device’s specs, I could see both of those games getting relegated to cloud versions, and I swear that’s not a pun on their spikey-haired hero. It just seems like that’s Square’s go-to approach for games that might be a bit too demanding on Nintendo’s system. Think of the groans that would echo throughout the theater when Square announced a <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake: Cloud Version </em>at a press conference! Would the company want that reaction to be associated with the game forever? Or maybe the pun would be too good to pass up as an expensive bit? Anyway, sure, yeah, let’s put these games on Switch 2.</p></div><div><p>Speaking of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, the critically acclaimed MMORPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a></span> would be a great showcase for the apparent mouse controls included in the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons. I’ve tried to play <em>XIV</em> on my PlayStation multiple times and loathe its controller support, so this could be a nice middle ground between the two. And again, more people playing a multiplayer game is always a good thing.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Diablo </em>games are ideal for handheld play, and <em>Diablo III</em> was great on the original Switch. <em>Diablo II </em>also found its way to the Switch through the <em>Resurrected </em>remaster, so the series has a strong history with the Nintendo console already. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422"><em>Diablo IV</em></a></span> feels like another guaranteed Switch 2 port down the line.</p></div><div><p>Rounding out this list are some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-it-good-goty-review-ea-1850419772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-it-good-goty-review-ea-1850419772">best <em>Star Wars </em>games on the market</a></span>.

            <p>Microsoft's Xbox portfolio of games is under the spotlight this evening as it airs a new Developer Direct at 6pm UK time. We'll be covering everything live as it happens, right here, as well as talking with you about the things that do. Why not join us? Crack some jokes! We like jokes.</p>
<p>But what is going to happen? We know a few things. We know the tasty-looking Doom: The Dark Ages will be a central focus and that we're probably going to get a release date for it - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-spotted-ahead-of-xbox-developer-direct">reportedly 15th May</a> - and we know we're getting a better look at Southern American folklore action adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, which I think looks great. A release date more specific than 2025 would be welcome.</p>
<p>The other named game on the slate for tonight is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">promising turn-based role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which Ed has been keeping a close - and interested - eye on, and which again, we could use a more specific release date for. Those are the named games. But we're also promised a look at a fourth game that's, as yet, a bit of a mystery. Could it be a game like Avowed or Fable, or are we going to see something completely new? Maybe it's time to wheel out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">the Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake that's been speculated about</a>.</p>
<p>That's the general shape of things but there could be other surprises too. Join us just before 6pm UK time as we prepare to find out.</p><figure>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will launch a major new expansion later this month named Space-Time Smackdown, featuring Legendary Pokémon fan-favourites Dialga and Palkia.
</p>
<p>
Space-Time Smackdown is set to launch within the hit smartphone game at the end of the month, after the app's card trading feature launches on 28th January.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat confusingly, a social media <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1882413987804934654">post</a> states the expansion will arrive on 30th January, though an attached trailer states it will launch on 29th January.

<p>
As you might expect, the expansion looks like it'll feature snazzy 3D cards for both Dialga and Palkia - both look to be hanging out on Spear Pillar, from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl and the more recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-arceus-walkthrough-guide-missions-objectives-8039">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. After previous nods to the main-series Pokémon games, it's a nice touch.
