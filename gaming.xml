            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna have announced a strategic partnership, which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>In a statement, Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertainment, said<em> “At Remedy, our primary focus continues to be what we do best—crafting industry-defining video games that have earned us global recognition. Now, the time is right to expand the reach of Remedy’s beloved franchises to an even broader global audience through film, television, and more. In Annapurna, we have found an outstanding partner who shares our ambition and passion for immersive storytelling. We are excited to see them bring the universes and characters we have created to life in new mediums, thanks to this unique deal.”&nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>“The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television, and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life,”</em> said Megan Ellison, Founder and CEO of Annapurna. <em>“By leveraging Remedy’s innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums.”</em></p>
<p>Previously, Remedy had a co-development partnership for Control 2 with 505 Games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/28/remedy-acquires-the-rights-to-the-control-series-from-505-games-includes-control-2-and-condor/">Remedy acquired the rights to the Control series from 505 Games</a>, which included Control 2 and the co-op project Concord. In May, Remedy did announce the cancellation of another co-op game that had the codename<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/remedy-cancels-co-op-multiplayer-title-project-kestrel/"> Project Kestrel</a>, and this was in development with Tencent as a partner.</p>

<p>There have been attempts in the past to bring Alan Wake to the movie screen before, stretching all the way back to 2010. And back in 2020, Gary Whitta expressed interest in writing a script for a Control movie, though this has not gone anywhere. Who knows? Maybe Gary will get the call up to write the movie now.</p>

            <p>
Against the Storm - the critically acclaimed city building rogue-like from Eremite Games - is set to get its first major expansion, titled Keepers of the Stone, on 26th September this year.
</p>
<p>
Against the Storm, if you're unfamiliar, challenges players to survive the apocalyptic Blightstorm ravaging the kingdom by gradually upgrading the Smoldering City at its heart. That requires setting out across multiple biomes and establishing a series of settlements, success in each location only coming if players can meet the Scorched Queen's endless demands.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to the newly announced Keepers of the Stone expansion. This promises to build on the base game's already superb action by introducing, firstly, the Coastal Groves biome, where settlements start along the water. Here, players can build the Strider Port, enabling them to launch expeditions for treasures lost in the surrounding depths.

<p>
Keepers of the Stone also introduces the Frogs - a new species joining the existing Humans, Beavers, Lizards, Harpies, and Foxes - who are particularly proficient with stone masonry, enjoy the rain, and can increase the rate at which new citizens join settlements. Frogs also demand special upgradable Frog Houses, rather than the usual shelters.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the expansion adds new upgrade tree rewards in the Smoldering City - all intended to benefit the Frogs - alongside three new Legendary Cornerstones, one new Epic Cornerstone, three new Rare perks, and five new Uncommon perks. Additionally, it brings 12 new orders reflecting the Frogs and their capabilities, plus 14 new music tracks.
</p>
<p>
Keepers of the Stone launches via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3075500/Against_the_Storm__Keepers_of_the_Stone/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/against_the_storm_keepers_of_the_stone">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/against-the-storm--keepers-of-the-stone">Epic</a>, and the Windows Store on 26th September (no price has been announced just yet), and will be accompanied by a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1336490/announcements/detail/4258802537449103613?snr=2___">substantial free base game update</a>. This introduces fishing - enabling players to acquire resources from variously sized ponds in glades, providing they build a Fishing Hut first - as well as an increased level cap, new buildings and resources, plus various balance changes and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>
"It's a pleasure to play something where every detail takes you back to the heart of what a game excels at," Eurogamer contributor Ruth Cassidy wrote in their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/against-the-storm-review-a-perfectly-chaotic-city-builder">five star review of Against the Storm</a> last year. "Every layer... reveals something more compelling than the layer above it - where that layer stands as something already deeply interesting in its own right."

			<p>STALKER 2 is real, and it's promising. I can confirm as much after having had the chance to try a brief demo of Episode 1 during Gamescom 2024. This sequel has had to go through an untold number of hurdles, starting with the cancellation of the original project (announced in 2010) and the disbandment of Ukrainian developer GSC Game World.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after a few years, the studio was reformed. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, the team went on to make STALKER 2 at long last. However, the troubles were far from over, starting with the Russian invasion of Ukraine that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> them to stop development for a while and relocate to Prague, and there was even an office <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-suffers-office-fire-due-to-electrical-installation-malfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fire</a> at some point.</p>
<p>The game is now basically complete, however, and it also looked fairly polished from what little I played. Granted, it would be impossible to even attempt to judge a game this big after a half-hour session where players were also left to understand the mechanics on their own. Still, the Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals certainly look great, and the atmosphere is top-notch.</p>
<p>After the hands-on, I chatted with Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka and PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov to discuss the game's short road to release. As a reminder, STALKER 2 will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X on November 20, and it will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце Чорнобиля — Developer Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bi17nPEG7jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>First of all, I wanted to ask how the team is doing. It would be a big understatement to say you've been through a lot. Now that you are so close to the finish line, what does it feel like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:</strong> I would say there's all kinds of anxiety and excitement. We are preparing both versions of the game, including a build for Microsoft, because we need to pass through the certification for the Xbox version, and we need to do it in advance. Starting yesterday, we also started to receive public opinions from Gamescom, and it was pure anxiety.</p>
<p>Currently, it's slightly changing because we see the reception and we see that actually people like what we are delivering. Having this kind of feedback from the fans is something that reinforces the team spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Last year, at Gamescom 2023, you allowed people to play STALKER 2 for the first time. How did last year's hands-on allow you to gather feedback, and what did you improve based on that feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>We had a lot to process. We were observing what the majority of the players were feeling. We also had a strike team discussing their impressions daily on what the players were doing in the demo and what they talked about. Based on that, we reshaped the way AI performs their actions, how they choose their targets, and how they fight against the player. Most essentially, we have redone the dialogue system, so talking to other NPCs became, I would say, more fluid and more natural. I guess there were many more tiny things that improved, too.</p>
<p><strong>Performance, too, I'd wager.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yes, but that is something that we didn't just gather from the users' feedback. We just knew it had to be done. If you play on Xbox Series X, you will see the console version running at 60 frames per second, which is proof of all the efforts of our team in terms of performance.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> I must say that the overall feedback that we had from last year's event had a big impact on our decision to postpone STALKER 2 because it was the first time people played it. All of them said it was a true STALKER experience, shaping up nicely, but still needed some time in an oven. Since we don't have a publisher and it actually, of course, costs us money, but we don't have a publisher, so we have a certain degree of freedom of deciding when to release. So that was really useful in terms of gathering this feedback together to actually improve the game, postpone, and take time to polish certain things. We're super glad that we actually showed it, that people played it, and that we learned there were certain ways to go to improve on our way to release.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that you are self-publishing, but you do have a partnership with Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> That's right. That's a Game Pass partnership and Microsoft is not pushing us in any way to release on any date or just put the content out of the game or something like that. Actually, Microsoft, they are super supportive of us. We didn't exactly ask someone from Microsoft to be our friends, but Sarah Bond is obviously a friend of the game. Phil (Spencer) was super supportive, all the teams from Microsoft were. They didn't put any additional pressure on us. So basically, we're self-publishing, and then we have a Game Pass deal with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Did they help you with the optimization of the Xbox versions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Well, our team is mature enough to take care of many aspects of the game themselves. Yet, the Xbox team knows best how the Xbox performs and what's better to do in a case like we need to go deeper into the optimization. The Microsoft team visited several times, providing essential expertise on what else we could do that we didn't think of. It's not over yet. Aside from Xbox Series X, we're still working on optimization for Xbox Series S. It's going well, and the Xbox team is contributing a lot.</p>
<p><strong>I guess the Xbox Series S is the toughest platform to optimize for because it's weaker than the others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>In our case, it's quite achievable. On Xbox Series X, we have two available modes. One of them is Performance Mode, where the game is running with 60 FPS and slightly different graphics than in Quality Mode, which looks super awesome with all the reflections and high-resolution textures, but runs at 30 FPS. We are trying to achieve a similar experience on Xbox Series S by combining these two approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean it will run at 30 FPS on the Xbox Series S with the same settings as the X's 60 FPS mode?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Not yet. So far, we have it at 25ish FPS on the Xbox Series S, but we still have space to optimize.</p>

<p><strong>On the PC side, you're working with NVIDIA, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yes. We are going to have software ray tracing. As for hardware ray tracing, it's too early for us, but we are experimenting with that. We are trying to have it on the release date, but it is highly unlikely you will have it at launch. But NVIDIA DLSS will be there.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, let's talk about the game itself. Have you shared an estimate of how long it will take to complete STALKER 2 on average?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>So far, I can judge only through the playthroughs me and my colleagues I had my colleagues had, but you know, when we play, we are way different from each other, as we are focusing on different stuff. I would say it will take approximately 25 to 40 hours to beat the game, and yet, within one playthrough, you won't see all the content we have because the story is nonlinear, and your decisions impact what you're going to see and some locations will change based on the decisions you made. So, I would say that to beat the game once, it will take 25 to 40 hours. But to see the whole game, you would need several playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>I know you confirmed that there will be several endings to the story. Can you share how many?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>I think it was just confirmed yesterday on IGN, so it's super fresh. It will be three.</p>
<p><strong>On the game's Steam page, it says that you'll support mods. Can you discuss that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yeah. STALKER is a known franchise not only because of the games but also because of the support from the mod community, which has thrived for the last 15 years, and we don't really want to abandon these people. So, after the release, I can't say when exactly, but we want to do it as close as possible to the release date, we will have the official mod support. We are cooking up some new, interesting initiatives for next year.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to distribute the mod tools?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to download mods in STALKER 2, or is it going to be out of the game like most PC mods?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>That's something to be defined, but we are striving to support both PC and console.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>Yeah, we're actually already supporting them with Mod.io in the original trilogy. I can't confirm whether it's going to be Mod.io or something else for STALKER 2. But the thing is, the modding scene is a little bit of a Wild West right now where you need to download files, replace files, et cetera, so we want to make it structured. There are certain ways on the market to make it structured: Steamworks, Mod.io, and others. We're exploring, we're playing for that, and we want to do it as close to release as possible, but we cannot just guarantee it's going to be on the release, but we are doing our best efforts to be there on time.</p>
<p><strong>You also mentioned multiplayer support coming after release. What else can you say about it, if anything? How long after the release, and what would it be like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I don't think we have many updates on that side. We are now fully concentrated on single player.</p>
<p><strong>Is it still planned to be relatively soon after release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is supposed to be an update after the release.</p>
<p><strong>A free update?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Yes. But for now, we're making the single player as polished as possible. Everything connected to multiplayer probably belongs to our post-launch phase, so we just don't have an update on that right now.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Multiplayer is supposed to be a free update coming after launch.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay. Putting aside the multiplayer topic, are you going to continue to improve STALKER 2 post-launch with new features?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>First of all, we are going to have to do the story DLCs. These will be huge story DLCs which would expand on the story of the characters and the zone itself. Before the DLCs are released, we will provide several free updates for all players. You shouldn't expect any cut quests because we are not cutting anything from the story. Yet, there are a few things that our team wants to deliver, but we know they're tiny things that will be very nice for the players, but they can wait till the post-release. So, you can expect several free updates along with the patches and bug fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>We're crafting a game that we really hope, and we're working hard on that, will not be a game to be forgotten two weeks after release. As Slava said, we're going to support it. At the moment, we're doing our best efforts to polish the game. If there is anything not quite there, of course, we're going to fix it post-launch just to make it technically better. At the same time, we plan to support this game for a while, so it's not just something to be released and forgotten.</p>
<p>Obviously, the three DLCs are part of this plan to keep it updated. Probably, part of our efforts will be dedicated to the technical stage until the release, and then we're going to continue with free updates and DLCs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What are you doing with the additional time you have with this last two-month <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delayed-november-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>It's specifically to improve polish. During this period, we are fully focusing on fixes and optimization. We are not adding anything new; we just want to make sure that the players will get the best experience on the release date, so that's why we needed this additional amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>And to spend some more money on that as well, because it's a big team and we're basically financing the game ourselves, so it's also additional expenses for us. That's the other side of the delays that not everyone talks about</p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Everything comes at a price.</p>
<p><strong>That's why publishers often say no, just release the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>Probably yes, so not having a publisher is nice. We can spend more money *laughs*.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the team at GSC Game World right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>430 plus. New members come in constantly; I think it was 430 plus when I checked last time, so somewhere around there, all working on one game.</p>
<p><strong>That's more than I expected. I mean, CD PROJEKT has fewer developers working on the new The Witcher game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zakhar Bocharov: </strong>Do you want a fun fact? This guy (Slava) worked on Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We are 430 plus. New members come in constantly; I think it was 430 plus when I checked last time, so somewhere around there, all working on one game.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Interesting. What can you tell me about the A-Life 2.0 AI system? What kind of behaviors will fans notice while playing STALKER 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>In every region, with some slight exceptions, you may run into encounters that will be generated based on where you are, what's happening around you, and what happened before. Let's say that a couple of NPCs go near an Anomaly, they start to fight each other, another NPC someone steps in the fight and dies. You can observe all that. But this part of A-Life is quite simple because it's based on the generic components: NPC, mutant, Anomaly. There are also special encounters, which are little bit tiny stories, and all of them have their own specifics, and they'll be able to be more interesting, I would say, showing off how the AI works. There can be quite unexpected events.</p>
<p><strong>Can you help NPCs during these encounters?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slava Lukyanenka: </strong>Typically, it's something about finding someone's stash. These are simple tasks. Every Stalker scattered stashes across the zone to keep their stuff. Maybe someone sends you there to pick it up, yet something happens along the way or around the stash. That is one of the examples of the short stories you'll encounter in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-debuts-new-harry-potter-quidditch-champions-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games released a new Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions trailer. This trailer gives those excited for the game an exclusive look into the gameplay, specifically the PvP mode, the customization, skill trees, the various Broom upgrades, Career mode and much more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions - Official Launch Gameplay Walkthrough Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMJpa5uyugw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is just over five minutes, giving players glimpses into everything they could possibly need to know about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-pre-orders-available-now/">Harry Potter game</a>. For those who prefer a solo experience, the career mode starts at the Weasley Burrow in the Garden Cup, where you'll get to face off against familiar faces from the iconic franchise while fully customizing your character to look however you want them to.</p>
<p>You get to represent one of the great three wizarding schools, Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Durmstrung Institute, or Hogwarts School of Wizardry at the Triwizard Schools Quidditch Cup. If you are successful in your competitions, you'll be able to go on to the ultimate challenge of competing at the Quidditch World Cup.</p>
<p>Compared to other games that are out, the abilities and customization you can unlock in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions are purely through in-game progression, and none of it can be bought with real-life currency. To unlock new abilities and customization, players will have to work to get skill points that can allow them to access special moves and broom upgrades. The broom upgrades allow players to move faster, gain more agility, and more to help them become a Quidditch champion.</p>
<p>For those who are excited about the PvP element of the game, you can choose your role, which can be either a Chaser, Keeper, Beater, or Seeker, much like the traditional roles that are shown in the movies. While you can choose the role you control, you also have to control an additional Chaser as well.</p>
<p>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions<a href="https://www.quidditchchampions.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> releases on September 3, 2024</a> for the digital editions, which will be available across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and PC. For those who want the game's physical edition, you'll have to wait until November 8, 2024. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be released some time during the holiday season, but there isn't a specific set date for it yet.</p>
<p>For those who may be on the fence about purchasing Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, the game will be available to PlayStation Plus members at no additional cost from September 3 through September 30, 2024. Those playing it via PlayStation Plus will also get an additional redeemable cosmetic they can use in-game.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-5-improvements-in-the-massive-update-that-introduced-hunt-showdown-1896</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-5-improvements-in-the-massive-update-that-introduced-hunt-showdown-1896.967677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-5-improvements-in-the-massive-update-that-introduced-hunt-showdown-1896<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It’s a new era, with better performance and visuals, new content, and more.</h2></div><section><p>The extraction first-person shooter Hunt: Showdown has been going strong for five years and has gotten dozens of patches and updates, but none as big as the one that launched recently. It’s such a significant upgrade that the game itself got a new name — Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Hunt: Showdown, it’s a multiplayer shooter on PC and console that mixes the supernatural with dark realism. It’s a PvPvE extraction shooter that puts you in the shoes of a bounty hunter. In order to claim your bounties, you need to venture across large maps, kill supernatural creatures, and fend off your fellow hunters to survive long enough to reach the extraction point.</p><p>The game’s recent update might have changed the name, but it’s not a sequel or standalone expansion. So if you purchased the original game, you already have access to Hunt: Showdown 1896 for no additional cost. All you have to do is download the update, and you’ll get upgrades to virtually every part of the gameplay experience. Let’s get into specifically what those improvements are.</p><h2><strong>A New Engine</strong></h2><p>It all starts with the game’s move to CryEngine 5.11. That makes all the rest of the upgrades possible, raising the level of what the dev team at Crytek can accomplish across the board. In addition to improving things like performance and visual fidelity, the new engine will also allow Crytek to make future updates and react to community feedback faster. The central gameplay loop won’t significantly change, but the upgrades will give players on all platforms a more immersive experience.</p><h2><strong>Improved Console Performance</strong></h2><p>Speaking of platforms, the update moves Hunt: Showdown 1896 into the current generation of consoles. It now runs natively on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while that means it’s no longer playable on PS4 or Xbox One, it also isn’t held back by the technological limitations of those consoles. It now runs at 60 fps and in HDR on all consoles, with faster loading times and more responsive input, providing smoother gameplay.</p><h2><strong>Better Lighting and Visuals</strong></h2><p>On all platforms, the upgraded engine has allowed devs to improve visual fidelity, including textures, lighting, and animations. With richer blacks and higher quality lighting, interior locations look more realistic and added visibility means more details to spot. Character models have also been improved, while flowing water looks more crisp and realistic. These details may seem small on their own, but they add up to create a more immersive experience.</p><h2><strong>Audio Upgrade</strong></h2><p>The game’s audio mix in general has been fine tuned to provide more clarity and sound definition. The update also adds support for new spatial audio options, such as Dolby Atmos. If you like to play with headphones, you’ll also have access to 3D audio. PC and Xbox players will benefit from Microsoft Sonic for headphones, while PS5 players will get Tempest 3D audio compatibility.</p><h2><strong>New Content</strong></h2><p>While the previous improvements refined what was already there, a new era wouldn’t be complete without brand-new content that really mixes things up. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has that in spades. Up until now, the game has exclusively taken place in the swamps of Louisiana. But the new update features a one-year time skip and a shift in setting to the Colorado Rocky Mountains. </p><p>The new map, Mammon’s Gulch, focuses on verticality, with mountains stretching aboveground and mines burrowing below. It provides unique sight lines and attack angles, adding another strategic layer to gameplay. And if you’re a longtime player and fan of older maps, don’t worry, they’ll be returning in the coming months after getting revamps of their own.</p><p>Mammon Gulch isn’t the only addition. There’s also a new wild target called the Hellborn, as well as an event called Scorched Earth that sees new terrors spill out of fiery oil wells and underground mines.</p><p>The latest update is full of improvements and new content, but it’s just the start of a new era. Crytek will continue to update and fine tune the experience, as they have been for the past five years. Whether you’re a veteran or a newcomer, there’s never been a better time to dive in. Hunt: Showdown 1896 is available for download now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Happy hunting!<br>

But, for some reason, most of the games I’ve been waiting for a good deal on are at their lowest prices ahead of Labor Day weekend. In fact, I'm seeing better Switch deals now than anything I could find during Prime Day earlier this year. If you’re like me and have been waiting to pick up Tears of the Kingdom or the new Mario Kart, now might be the time to go for it. </p><h2>Best Zelda Deals I've Seen This Year</h2><div id="206635" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206636"><div id="206636" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3></p></div><p>Before <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> drops in September, Walmart has cut prices on the two most recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-zelda-games-on-nintendo-switch">Zelda games on Switch</a>. Last year's Tears of the Kingdom is at a lower price than it’s <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B097B2YWFX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ever been on Amazon</a>. BotW and TotK were both released to critical acclaim (IGN gave them both 10/10), and it's never been more affordable to explore open-world Hyrule. </p><h2>(Super) Discounts on Mario Games</h2></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206630"><div id="206630" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Mario Bros.

My pick of the bunch is the beloved co-op platformer, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Maker 2, and Mario Party Superstars are all discounted during Walmart's Labor Day sale. If you’re more interested in the other Super Bro., you can get $9 off this year’s Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD. We’ve also found a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-game-for-nintendo-switch-drops-to-32-at-woot">Woot deal on Super Mario RPG</a>.</p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Super Mario Maker 2</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Mario Party Superstars</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</h3></p></div></div><h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Is $10 Off in Rare Sale</h2></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206637"><div id="206637" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3></p></div><p>The Animal Crossing series is a pillar of the cozy gaming community, but New Horizons is one of those first-party Nintendo titles that almost never goes on sale. In fact, it hasn’t been on sale on Amazon <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07SL6ZXBL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">since 2022</a>. So $10 off might not seem like the biggest steal, but it’s probably the best AC:NH deal we’ll see this year. If you’ve been wanting to start collecting bugs, decorating your island, and most importantly, paying your dues to Tom Nook, now’s the time. </p><h2>Get 5 Five Night's at Freddy's Games for Under $20</h2></div><div catalogid="eb923770-6acc-4837-b4dc-bffa03159e7f" id="206641"><div id="206641" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Five Nights at Freddy's: The Core Collection</h3></p><div><p>Includes 1-4 + Sister Location</p></div></div><p>If you're looking to add something with a darker tone to your handheld, this collection of the first Five Night's at Freddy's games is 50% off. Start off with trying to survive the night at your new security job, but progressively discover a number of Freddy Fazbear locations while unravelling the secrets of the animatronics they still house. </p><h2>More Discounts on Nintendo Switch Games</h2><p>Plenty more Switch games are on sale going into Labor Day weekend, and I’ll be adding any more deals I find to this list. </p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Super Smash Bros.

Nintendo hasn't confirmed anything about the console, including whether it will backwards-compatible with original Switch games. That said, there's long list of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">Switch games coming out</a> that I personally am still excited for. If you don't have a Switch already, maybe consider holding off for the upgrade (thought <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-lite-deals-labor-day-2024">Walmart has some great deals on Switch consoles</a> for those who can't resist). Otherwise, the current Nintendo console supports great games that will always be worth playing. </p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 29, 2024 5:00 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’d rather not wait and see, the standard <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> is currently receiving a rare discount at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFJWCYTL/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, where you can buy it with blue and red Joy-Con controllers for $267 ($33 off). </p><p>If you like to game on the go, the base Switch remains an excellent handheld, one that can last up to six hours on a single charge. It’s still limited to 32GB of built-in storage — unlike the larger, seven-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Switch OLED</a> — but its built-in microSD card slot means you can always invest in more external storage. That’ll come in handy because the Nintendo eShop is home to a vast library of both first- and third-party titles, particularly in its swan-song era, with many exciting games in the pipeline. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi:</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Brothership</em></a> are both launching in the fall, for example, along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></a>, a remastered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229056/mysims-nintendo-switch-remastered-launch"><em>MySims</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228945/nintendo-indie-partner-direct-news-trailers">much more</a>.</p><p>Granted, the Switch 2 is rumored to feature an eight-inch screen, but the standard model’s 6.2-inch display is still spacious enough in most instances. Besides, if you crave more screen real estate, you can always play it on your TV while in docked mode, unlike the Switch Lite.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Read our original Nintendo Switch review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch offers a 6.2-inch touchscreen, three play styles, and a Wi-Fi connection, thus enabling multiplayer gaming (with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription).</p></div><p>If you’re looking for a piece of home decor to spruce up your home or office, few gadgets are as unique as <strong>Samsung’s new Music Frame</strong>.

You can hang the speaker on your wall or rest it on the included stand and even customize it with an <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/business/televisions-home-theater/television-home-theater-accessories/audio-accessories/music-frame-white-bezel-vg-scfd60wtbza/">optional white bezel</a> ($59.99).</p><p>But what’s really neat is that the Music Frame also functions as a wired Bluetooth / Wi-Fi speaker, which is one of the reasons the gadget was one of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car">our favorite audio products from CES 2024</a>. It’s not going to sound as immersive as a high-end soundbar or a speaker with up-firing drivers like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23657335/sonos-era-300-review-spatial-audio-atmos-speaker">Sonos Era 300</a>, but it supports Dolby Atmos and can pair with select Samsung TVs or soundbars for surround sound. The art-inspired speaker is also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Samsung Bixby, allowing you to control it with just your voice.</p><div><p>Samsung’s Music Frame is a 12.9 x 12.9-inch picture frame with a physical print at the front that you can customize with art or a photo.

                <p>Five years ago, Remedy Entertainment made a splash with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a>, but the developer had to go through 505 Games to publish the game. Now, Remedy has struck a deal with Annapurna that will not only bring Control 2 to fruition, but it may also lead to films and TV shows based on the games and Remedy's other signature title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-remastered-review/1900-6260843/" data-ref-id="1900-6260843">Alan Wake</a>.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's official site</a>, the company's new pact with Annapurna will allow it to co-finance and self-publish Control 2. Remedy also promised that the deal means the company "is able to make Control 2 exactly the game we want it to be, while we now also have an incredible partner to extend our IPs to other mediums." The developer reiterated that Control 2 is in the works, but no further details were revealed.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Annapurna's president of Interactive and New Media, Hector Sanchez, shared his belief that Remedy's titles can go even further into other mediums.</p><p>"This deal with Remedy isn't just about adapting great games--it's about breaking new ground in how companies can collaborate," said Sanchez in a statement. "By backing Remedy's move toward self-publishing, we're putting our faith in their vision. We know from experience that Remedy is a first-class games development partner, and we're excited to share their work with an even wider audience by bringing the Control and Alan Wake universes to film, television and beyond."</p><p>At this stage, there's no word on when the potential Alan Wake or Control adaptations will go forward. Control 2 is currently without a release date, but the announcement reiterated that Remedy is also developing a slate of games beyond that title. Among the games that we know about are remakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-hits-important-milestone-as-max-payne-1-and-2-remakes-go-into-full-production/1100-6525672/" data-ref-id="1100-6525672">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a>, as well as a multiplayer spin-off of Control that is codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-is-still-a-ways-off-but-spin-off-codename-condor-is-getting-closer/1100-6523034/" data-ref-id="1100-6523034">Condor</a>.</p>

For example, <strong>beginning at $3, you can pick up the HD remaster of the first <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Resident Evil Revelations</em>, and the first episode of <em>Revelations 2</em>.</strong> The first title is obviously a classic that defined the survival horror genre, and gave us some of gaming’s most enduring characters in folks like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. Though remakes and remasters can be hit or miss, the <em>Resident Evil </em>series actually has one of the most sterling track records in this department, and it all more or less started with this game.<br></p><p>I’ve never gotten around to the <em>Revelations </em>sub-series, which curiously began on the Nintendo 3DS, but I remember hearing at the time that they were a refreshing return to the series’ roots. After some time, the <em>Resident Evil </em>games started to become more synonymous with outrageous plotlines and non-stop action than horror, and while some welcomed the evolution, others missed what made them love the series in the first place. <em>Revelations </em>was a bid to win back that hardcore audience that missed slower, scarier games, and the success of them seemed to pave the way for the mainline games to return to survival horror as well.<br></p><p>Speaking of the screwy path that the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise eventually found itself on, the next tier of the Humble Bundle packages in a ton more games. <strong>For $7, you can pick up everything I already mentioned, as well the critically beloved </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 4</strong></em><strong>, its less acclaimed action-centric follow-ups, </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 5 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>6 </strong></em><strong>(and their respective DLCs), </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 0, </strong></em><strong>and all of </strong><em><strong>Revelations 2</strong></em><strong>, which was released piecemeal</strong>. The legacy of <em>4</em> is well-established (and it has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">pretty great remake</a></span> from last year) but both <em>5 </em>and <em>6</em> have divided fans for years. Some are in favor of the gung-ho, balls-to-the-wall action of these increasingly ludicrous games, but for others, this is where the series really jumped the shark. I think if you are a person capable of shutting your brain off and being a part of really dumb sequences of events, such as punching a huge boulder, then you can’t really go wrong checking them out.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 0 </em>and <em>Revelations 2</em>, like the first <em>Revelations </em>game, are slower, and far more typical, installments in the franchise, though neither is particularly beloved. If you just want to round out the bases, though, it can’t hurt to pick them up.</p><p><strong>For $20, you get all of the aforementioned titles, <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard </em>and its DLCs,<em> </em></strong><br><strong>and the recent remakes of <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>. </strong>This widely beloved trio of games have more or less ushered the franchise into a renaissance since the late 2010s. The first brought the mainline games back to survival horror but also shook up the formula by putting the action in first-person. This romp through a decrepit manor in the Louisiana bayou was creepy as fuck, and introduced Ethan Winters, the corny catch-phrase spewing protagonist of the game and its immediate sequel. While it’s definitely a little clunky, <em>RE7 </em>is the most atmospheric and unsettling of the modern games, in case you’re looking for the most frightening prospects.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>, meanwhile, are currently held up as the gold standard of remakes across the industry. They both maintain the spirit of their original iterations while modernizing the controls and visuals in a from-the-ground-up reimagining. Even if people are down on <em>3</em>—which I believe mostly has to do with the fact that people <em>never </em>really liked it as much as <em>2</em> to begin with—you’ve got two absolute bangers here that Capcom managed to develop in tandem and release in back-to-back years.</p><p>Finally, the biggest bundle is the previously mentioned <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fresident-evil-decades-horror-village-gold%3Fhmb_source%3D%26hmb_medium%3Dproduct_tile%26hmb_campaign%3Dmosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_residentevildecadeshorrorvillagegold_bundle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fresident-evil-decades-horror-village-gold%3Fhmb_source%3D%26hmb_medium%3Dproduct_tile%26hmb_campaign%3Dmosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_residentevildecadeshorrorvillagegold_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>$30 one</strong></a></span><strong> that brings everything, including the most recent mainline entry, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></em></a></span><strong>, as well as its DLC.</strong> <em>Village</em> maintains the first-person perspective of its horror-focused predecessor, but shifts gears once again. Stylistically, it’s like a first-person <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and plays a lot of the same hits, like opening in a creepy village in the middle of nowhere, but it also takes some even wilder swings in due time. It is also the game that gave us Lady Dimitrescu, otherwise known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943">big woman that the internet wanted to step on them</a></span>.</p><p>Even if the ending of the game dragged on a little too long for me, I’m pretty confident that <em>Village </em>is actually my favorite <em>RE </em>game, since it pretty successfully melds all of the disparate things the series has been over the years into something that’s <em>mostly </em>cohesive and, importantly, ludicrously fun.</p><p>For as little as half of a retail game, you can play <em>the </em>most legendary survival horror series in games. Considering that Capcom unceremoniously announced a sequel earlier this year, now’s as good a time as any to jump on in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We now seem to know exactly why Black Myth: Wukong isn’t on Xbox consoles yet. According to Forbes reporter Paul Tassi, Black Myth: Wukong has a console exclusivity deal with PlayStation.</p>



<p>“A source with knowledge of the situation has told me that Black Myth: Wukong is not currently on Xbox because of an exclusivity deal, and is not delayed because of any sort of technical issue,” <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Just one week ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tassi reported</a> that the game wasn’t on Xbox due to a “Tech Issue”. This comes based on the statements made from developer Game Science. More on that below.</p>



<p>“The bad news is that once again, Xbox seems to have blundered into a Baldur’s Gate 3 situation,” he said at the time.</p>



<p>In his latest report, however, Tassi references the conflicting statements between Microsoft and Game Science. Game Science has gone on record stating that they were “currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version” to hit quality standards. There has been no mention from the studio of any sort of exclusivity deal with PlayStation. Microsoft, on the other hand, has said in multiple statements that it “can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders”.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">from the start, the statements from Game Science and Microsoft conflicted with each other, with Game Science citing optimization while Microsoft cited "deals with other platform holders." <a href="https://t.co/47Up179ZWh">pic.twitter.com/47Up179ZWh</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1829216520502948098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For now, no such deal has been confirmed by either developer Game Science or Sony. Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony and Game Science for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>Since its release on PC and PlayStation 4, Black Myth: Wukong has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million copies</a>. It’s also become the second-highest played game in Steam history when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to concurrent users</a>. </p>



<p><strong>EDITOR’S NOTE: Paul Tassi has clarified that his original report was based on what Game Science said at the time, as mentioned above. He states that he believes his source regarding an exclusive deal for PlayStation.</strong> <strong>This article has been updated to reflect that.</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think PlayStation really has an exclusivity deal for Black Myth: Wukong, or is it actually a tech issue keeping the game off Xbox consoles right now?

			<p>Wizard101 is one of the <a href="https://www.wizard101.com/?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist+PR+List+-+Leading+Gaming+and+Tech+News+%282023%29&amp;utm_campaign=71122f979a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_22_05_15_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-9e9ced9085-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most iconic MMOs</a> out there. It is set to be released on all console platforms, including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. This release comes after its first release on PC in 2008, making the game a whopping 16 years old.</p>
<p>If you've wanted to get stuck into an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/">MMO</a> that takes you through a magical school with deckbuilding and strategic turn-based combat, Wizard101 is the way to go. There are over 20 magical worlds for players to explore, all with unique traits that make them memorable and special. You get to play as a student wizard, where you'll have to go on your journey, completing quests and meeting new people in bustling worlds full of active players. The game will also be fully voice-acted, giving each quest that personal touch.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you've been wanting to introduce your friends to this MMO but they are all on console, console users will share a server, allowing those on PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch to all play with each other via crossplay.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Wizard101 on console, they have released a short 26-second trailer to get dedicated players excited about finally being able to play the game on console, as well as players who don't have access to a PC being able to play it on console for the first time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wizard101 Official Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdH0cSINQlA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when Wizard101 will be available on console, and KingsIsle Entertainment has yet to announce it. While Wizard101 has been around for a while, it was only added to Steam in 2018, with it being a much more efficient way of running the game.</p>
<p>Even though the game is relatively old, there are still millions of players getting stuck into Wizard101 regularly, and the game is home to over a thousand hours of questing to be done. This doesn't include the battles players can participate in, where they can participate in 1v1 duels or team-based battles to try and get a space on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>This MMO is still home to weekly rewards, praising players for their dedication to the game and rewarding them for their time and effort spent completing challenges set out for them in-game, with the events of Wizard101 rotating weekly to provide as much variety as possible for the players.</p>
