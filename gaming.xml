		<p>Riot Games has announced that its free to play 5v5 tactical shooter VALORANT is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Furthermore, the developer confirmed that there will be a limited beta on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, starting from June 14th. The beta will initially be available in e United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan, and those interested in playing should register on the official website, <a href="http://www.beta.playvalorant.com/">http://www.beta.playvalorant.com/</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valorant - Cinematic Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkmTMha31qc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“When exploring whether to bring VALORANT to additional platforms, we knew we had to be able to offer the same uncompromising, competitive experience that we’ve provided to PC players for years: a precise, team-based, tactical shooter,”</em> said Arnar Gylfason, Production Director of VALORANT at Riot Games. <em>“We were adamant that VALORANT’s core, competitive gameplay must feel natural on a controller; and if we couldn’t deliver on that gameplay promise we had to be prepared to walk away from it. We hope we nailed it, but ultimately, our players will have the final say.”</em></p>
<p>As mentioned in the quote above, the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of VALORANT have been built with console specific features in mind. Riot Games has stated the console versions will have parity with the PC version of the game, including patches, new agents, new maps, and additional premium content.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/21/valorant-is-getting-a-full-release-in-june/">VALORANT was first fully released in June 2020 for PC.</a> The game broke records on Twitch when it entered into closed beta back in April 2020, with 1.7 million concurrent viewers, however, a lot of this would have been down to Riot Games using Twitch as a direct marketing tactic at the time. The only way to gain access to the beta was to watch a stream of someone else playing the game and get a code, something that was taken away with the full release of VALORANT.</p>

		<p>Capcom has confirmed the release its intriguing action strategy game Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, stating it will be available from July 19th. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - &quot;Soh&quot; Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuVS2SpFQz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, the sacred Mt. Kafuku has been ruined by its inhabitants, creating a rift between the human and spirit realms. The Seethe, a corrupting force, emerge from this rift, further tainting the world, so to counteract this, the Spirit Stone Maiden must conduct a cleansing ritual, but she requires a protector and guide to achieve her mission and repel the Seethe once again. The complication arises when the 12 masks, which grant powers to their bearers, are stolen. Soh, the player’s character, and Yoshiro, the maiden, must collaborate to expel the Seethe from the villages.</p>
<p>Players don’t just control Soh; they can form alliances with villagers and bring them into combat. Daytime is for preparation: purifying the village, saving villagers to enlist their aid, and fixing devices for a tactical edge. At night, the focus shifts to defending the Maiden and the village from malevolent spirits, empowering villagers with masks for the fight. The gameplay is a fusion of real-time strategy and action.</p>

            <p>
Alan Wake 2: Night Springs, the game's first slice of DLC, arrives in a matter of hours, on Saturday 8th June. </p>
<p>And, later this year, the main game will get a boxed version for the first time - after criticism of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-digital-only-because-it-gives-remedy-more-time-to-polish">Remedy's previous decision to launch digital-only</a>.
</p>
<p>
Remedy boss Sam Lake confirmed the news tonight on the Summer Game Fest 2024 stage, and explained what Night Springs had in store: a trio of 'What if' tales featuring familiar characters, allowing the Alan Wake development team to get even weirder than ever.

<p>
These three stories will star Alan Wake 2's biggest Alan Wake fan Rose the Wiatress, Alan Wake 2 actor Shawn Ashmore seemingly playing a version of the real-life actor Shawn Ashmore, and then Control star Jesse Faden, in a cool Remedy crossover. 
</p>
<p>A photo mode for Alan Wake 2 is also on the way tomorrow too. Keen for even more Alan? A second DLC slice is coming later this year. </p>
<p>As for the game's physical editions, you'll be able to choose from a $80 Deluxe Edition out on 22nd October with the game, "deluxe items", the expansion pass, and a digital code for Alan Wake Remastered. A fancier collector's edition will follow in November priced $200 and include physical collector's items includeing a working Angel Lamp replica.</p>

            <p>Listen, I've got nothing against coffee games - they're some of my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tavern-talk-is-a-tasty-blend-of-coffee-talk-and-legends-lattes">absolute favourites</a> - but I've got to admit, I'm a tea-drinker at heart, and it always makes me a little bit sad when all I can serve in these games is a hot cuppa joe while tea gets relegated to the sidelines. Good on the developers at Ivy Road, then, for finally doing us tea-drinkers justice with their debut game Wanderstop.</p>
<p>Revealed this evening at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-tonights-summer-game-fest-2024-opening-showcase-right-here-with-us">Summer Game Fest</a>, Wanderstop's development is being headed up by Davey Wreden, creator of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide, as well as Karla Zimonja, co-creator of Gone Home and Tacoma, along with music duties being performed by Minecraft's composer, Daniel 'C418' Rosenfeld.  </p>

<p>You play as Alta, who desperately wants to get back in the fighting arena but must instead run a tea shop in the heart of a magical forest. Tough break, eh? I know which one I'd rather do.</p>
<p>As you slowly adjust to your new life, you'll need manage the shop, grow and harvest the necessary ingredients, and mix them altogether in your enormous flask machine to make the perfect blend. While your tea is steeping, you'll also need to keep your shop in tip-top shape, decorating and keeping it clean, while also chatting with customers. Or just, you know, having a nice sit on a bench.  </p>
<p>I'd certainly be down with that kind of routine, but alas, Alta has other ideas, and as you can see from the trailer, she isn't best pleased with her new life. Patience is not in Alta's nature, and she's not that keen on making small talk with the locals as she serves her hard-brewed tea, either. </p>
<p>How Alta will reconcile these two realities will no doubt form a big part of Wanderstop's overarching story, but for now, that's all we know about it. Hopefully we'll be able to find out more soon, as it's due out on PlayStation 5 and PC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam</a> in 2024 later this year.</p>

            <p>
Of no surprise to anyone given Nightdive's not exactly subtle tease earlier this week, cult classic squad-based survival horror shooter The Thing is getting a remaster - and it's launching later this year on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
The Thing, developed Computer Artworks and released back in 2002, serves as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 horror movie classic. It casts players as United States Army Special Forces member Captain Blake, who heads to the Antarctic outpost seen in the movie to find out what happened to its ill-fated research team.
</p>
<p>
The ensuing action is a third-person shoot-y kind of thing, with players able to get assistance from jittery survivors they meet along the way as they confront all manner of sinewy, alien-inhabited monstrosities. And the game did alright for itself back in the day, managing to shift over 1m copies - but Computer Artworks' collapse meant a planned sequel never emerged.

<p>
But now, back in 2024, retro specialist Nightdive Studios has announced it's working its magic on The Thing, promising improvements to character models, textures, and animations, plus updated lighting and atmospheric effects All this will run at up to 4K 120fps on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, with achievements and trophies also being added.
</p>
<p>
The result, according to Nightdive Studios (which is also currently working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-3do-haunted-house-shooter-killing-time-is-getting-a-nightdive-remaster">remaster of cult-classic 3DO haunted house shooter Killing Time</a>), is a "suspenseful and disgustingly detailed remaster that reanimates the thrilling game for modern audiences."
</p>
<p>
The Thing: Remastered, as the spruce-up is officially known, doesn't have a release date yet but it's launching digitally for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/">Steam</a> and GOG), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch later this year.

The developer has finally provided some details on the console version of the game, which will be available in a limited beta on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S starting on June 14th. You can register <a href="http://beta.playvalorant.com/">right here</a>. The beta will be limited to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, and Japan, and Riot says that it will be “possibly rolling out to remaining global regions shortly thereafter.” There’s no word on when a full launch might happen.</p><p>Riot says the console versions of <em>Valorant</em> feature “custom-built&nbsp;gameplay” and that crossplay between console and PC will not be available for competitive reasons. That said, the game will support cross-progression if you choose to play on both PC and console, meaning your skins and progression will carry over between platforms.</p><div><figcaption><em>Controller Valorant gameplay.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Riot Games</cite></p></div><p>“We were adamant that&nbsp;<em>Valorant’s</em>&nbsp;core, competitive gameplay must feel natural on a controller,” production director Arnar Hrafn Gylfason said in a statement. “And — if we couldn’t deliver on that gameplay promise — we had to be prepared to walk away from it. We hope we nailed it, but ultimately, our players will have the final say.”</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games">mobile version of <em>Valorant</em> was also announced in 2021</a>, though there has been little word on it since then. The console port will be jumping into a very crowded space for online shooters, going up against not only mainstays like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em> but also upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113437/marvel-rivals-trailer-netease-pc-mcu-disney"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168249/an-intro-to-sonys-next-multiplayer-shooter">Sony’s <em>Concord</em></a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Night Springs is a fictional TV show within the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, so of course that's also the focus of the meta-horror action game's expansion. It's three episodes, and it's out in under 24 hours.

<p>Much like the base game, the three episodes seem set to blur the lines between fiction and reality. Shawn Ashmore and Sam Lake both feature in the trailer above, but apparently any characters returning from Alan Wake 2 will be playing different, Night Springs-versions of themselves, and each episode focuses on a different character. One will be The Actor, based on Tim Breaker; The Waitress, described as a 'number one fan', and based on Rose Marigold; and The Sibling, based on Control's Jesse Faden.
</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is still only available via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/alan-wake-2">the Epic store</a> on PC. If you bought the Deluxe Edition at launch, that included an expansion pass and will include Night Springs, as well as an additional The Lake House DLC planned for October. 
</p>
<p>Remedy have been teasing this expansion for the past couple of days, renaming their social media and YouTube accounts to Poison Pill Entertainment. Poison Pill are the in-fiction producers of Night Springs. It's a surprise there's only a day to wait before the DLC is available, mind. Here's hoping it's the stylistic tour de force Katharine described in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">Alan Wake 2 review</a>.

Among Us developers Innersloth have announced Outersloth, a fund for independent game developers, alongside a bunch of games funded by the aforesaid fund for independent game developers. They all look rad, and Outersloth itself is a cool initiative.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
“It’s no secret the games industry has been through a lot of turmoil with layoffs and a lack of funding,” reads the announcement release. “Innersloth is incredibly lucky to have been able to find success and stay truly independent: no investors, no publishers, no acquisitions. This is all thanks to the support of players and industry friends. Sharing their success and seeing more indies games become sustainable is incredibly important to the team, which is why Outersloth was created!”</p>
<p>Behold - they've done a video.
</p>

<p>
The opening Outersloth line-up – Outersloth, Innersloth, I am absolutely going to get these mixed up in an article at some stage – includes a new game from Thirsty Suitors devs Outerloop Games. Working titled Project Dosa, it’s about two sisters, Samara and Amani, exploring a floral and fantastic world in a “spirit-mech”, which I imagine is powered by ghosts rather than oil. “In their efforts to reconnect with old relationships, they will reconcile with past friends and family members, discover and devour delicious new recipes, and battle it out in turn-based narrative combat,” a second press release explains. 
</p>
<p>
There’s also Rogue Eclipse, a space dogfighter from Huskrafts with destructible environments and an “Arabesque Futurism” aesthetic. “Easy to learn, tricky to master, and impossible to put down,” quoth a third press release.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s One Btn Bosses, a “minimalistic bullet hell game” with a synthwave soundtrack, which has a demo out now. According to a fourth press release, the full version features “a full handcrafted campaign spanning over 50 branching levels with a story focusing on workers rights, and a roguelite mode where they will be able to craft totally-broken builds to crunch through the bosses.”
</p>
<p>Those are just the three I could hammer through while writing up the announcement in the face of Geoff Keighley's relentless Summer Game Festing. You can read about a few more Outersloth projects on <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/outersloth/?mc_cid=c2f9babb42&amp;mc_eid=84531cc5ce">the official site</a> - they've signed up unannounced new games from Venba studio Visai Games, Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator devs Strange Scaffold, and Coldblood Inc, a studio co-founded by one of the makers of Celeste.</p>
<p>The page also includes some detail of how Outersloth funding works. They'll "most likely fund things between $50k-$2m", and they won't accept pitches for blockchain or web3 games, VR games or games that are already out in early access.

</p><p>
We’ll have more on each Outersloth-funded game separately in the fullness of time. For now, let me reiterate: rad games, cool initiative.

            <p>I’m not familiar with the proto-internet cartoon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/killer-bean">Killer Bean</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/90s-internet-animation-killer-bean-is-getting-a-video-game-and-it-looks-like-procedural-just-cause">Graham assures me</a> it’s fairly important in the history of online animation. Regardless, I’ve been won over by the upcoming video game of the same name from original creator Jeff Lew, which looks to blend together Just Cause stunt shenanigans, John Woo slo-mo gunfights and the energy of a third-person action game you would’ve found in a bargain bin for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Killer Bean the game is a third-person shooter roguelike that procedurally generates a whole new campaign - from locations and the enemies and bosses you’ll fight there - each time you play. That sounds fairly ambitious in itself, before you start referencing the plethora of gameplay features going on here.</p>
<p>There’s Just Cause vehicle play - the new trailer shows the Killer Bean skidding around in a car mowing down foes in a hail of bullets before leaping out, as well as grabbing a grenade in mid-air to lob it back to a group of baddies - and Max Payne-y bullet diving in slow motion, along with some Wanted-level bullet physics in first-person as bullets (which look to be steered with a Sniper Elite-like bullet cam) ricochet off each other to turn 90-degree corners around walls.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63cTsF-Aq08" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Also in the trailer is a snippet of something that seems to work like Hitman vision, letting the player spot the outline of enemies through walls - before leaping through a glass window to pop them in slow-motion again. At one point the bean also dodges bullets by breakdancing on the ground, which I hope is an actual move and not just a cutscene or something.</p>
<p>Aside from the gunplay, hand-to-hand (or, er, bean-to-bean?) combat is here, with Killer Bean shown taking on foes using Matrix-like kung-fu moves - including the bullet time ripples trailing their limbs - and wrestling slams, suplexing and tossing enemies around. At another point, Killer Bean is shown fighting a massive robot that reminded me of the oil rig boss from Nier Automata while zipping around the sea on a jetski. I can’t tell you more than that, but I liked what I saw.</p>
<p>The story apparently sees Killer Bean seeking revenge against the Shadow Agency that originally employed the bean as an assassin, before turning on them for reasons unknown. I’m less sure about the wisecracking dialogue, including the line “There’s a reason why I’m called Killer Bean”.</p>
<p>Either way, there seems to be a lot of ideas pouring into Killer Bean. We’ll be able to see how it all comes together when it lands in early access this summer.</p>

			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, Amazon Games announced New World: Aeternum, which brings the MMO originally launched on PC in September 2021 to consoles.</p>
<p>New World: Aeternum will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X (with full cross-play) on October 15 for $59.99. It includes the full base game and all previous updates, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-rise-of-the-angry-earth-expansion-is-out-on-october-3-for-29-99-adds-mounts-new-level-cap-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise of the Angry Earth expansion.</a> PC players who already own New World and Rise of Angry Earth won't have to pay anything more. All console players who pre-order the game and all existing PC players who log into the live servers from now through October 14 will receive the complimentary Azoth Stalker wolf mount. There's also a Deluxe Edition, priced at $79.99, and it comes with an exclusive Bear amount and armor skin.</p>
<p>Christoph Hartmann, Vice President of Amazon Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>New World: Aeternum is the culmination of years of focused development combined with input from the dedicated community of players who’ve already carved a path in the original New World on PC. Listening to player feedback is fundamental to how we make games, and we know New World: Aeternum delivers on the promise of a fresh and compelling New World experience that players can enjoy together across platforms.</em></p>
<p>Wccftech was recently invited to a press presentation ahead of the announcement where the developers stressed that the game has been fully optimized for console. It will sport complete feature parity with PC, in addition to combat action optimizations, controller accessibility options, a console-friendly user interface and user experience, target locking, aim assist, and virtual cursor.</p>
<p>The visuals have also been enhanced, as you can glean from the gallery of new screenshots embedded below.</p>

</figure>


<p>Amazon Games also clarified what kind of additions existing New World players can expect to find at launch. Those include a new cinematic introductory experience, upgraded onboarding for new players, improved quest flow, enhanced in-game cinematics, revamped story dialogues, the introduction of character archetypes (the game previously did not feature any classes, allowing players to freely mix and match weapons as they wished), the first 10-player endgame PvE raid, end-game solo trials, a Gear Score increase, the ability to swim, and a large-scale PvP zone. I inquired about the endgame PvE raid. Unfortunately, the team couldn't share much yet, but they did slip it would feature three challenging bosses for player groups to tackle.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-had-over-1-million-players-on-day-one-character-transfers-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big launch</a> with nearly a million concurrent players, New World only averages between 4 and 6K concurrent players on Steam. Clearly, Amazon hopes to revive interest in the MMO with New World: Aeternum, partly by adding console players and cross-play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173223/valorant-console-ps5-xbox-series-x-beta-release-riot-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9KJxCd">Riot Games has officially announced that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/2/21158401/valorant-how-riot-games-made-something-new"><em>Valorant</em></a><em> </em>is coming to consoles. The announcement of the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 versions of the tactical shooter came during the Summer Game Fest show on Friday, but Polygon had a chance to check out the game early and talk to its developers about how it translates to the new platforms. </p>
<p id="uFxqEf">Bringing <em>Valorant </em>to consoles was a no-brainer for Riot, according to its developers. After all, in the studio’s opinion, the idea of an audience that wants a complex tactical game isn’t unique to PC. Those kinds of players exist on consoles; they just haven’t really had a game that fits that niche.</p>
<p id="3SDgQI">“We’re working from the assumption that competitive players are competitive players no matter which platform they choose to play,” Arnar Gylfason, <em>Valorant</em>’s production director, told Polygon. “It is a bit of a leap of faith… to take this hardcore competitive tactical shooter to a platform that doesn’t have the same background and history of tactical shooters as PC.”</p>

<p id="iRY2Pv">But even if the audience is there, Riot’s bigger challenge was making sure it got the gameplay right when translating it from PC to console. </p>
<p id="G291vC">“The guiding light was always that the game has to feel good to play on consoles for us to want to make it,” Gylfason said. “That was always true. When the game didn’t feel right or wasn’t fun to play, we were like, <em>We either need to solve this or not [make] it.</em>”</p>
<p id="856FVg">The first big hurdle was figuring out how to translate <em>Valorant</em>’s methodical shooting to a controller. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/18/21294579/valorant-review-pc-riot-games-agent-unlocks-characters-free-to-play">Precise gunplay is the name of the game for <em>Valorant</em>’s PC version</a>, so the console version needed to match it without the benefit of a keyboard and mouse to make that precision easier. Riot’s answer to this is something called Focus Mode, which lets players enter a different, lower-sensitivity mode when they pull L2 or the left trigger. </p>

<p id="i5cQfF">According to Gylfason, this mode serves two purposes for Riot. It allows for the kind of precision that <em>Valorant</em>’s quick gunfights necessitate, allowing players to flick their analog stick toward targets in a snap before tapping the trigger to finesse their reticles to the target’s head. It also lets Riot keep the familiar “left trigger then right trigger” mechanism common in console shooters — the same one that Call of Duty helped establish nearly two decades ago. </p>
<p id="QZfwJv">All of this leads to an experience that, in my time playing, feels fundamentally and unmistakably like <em>Valorant</em>. It’s still a tactical shooter, it’s still slow-paced and careful, and almost no changes have been made to the core gameplay to move it over to consoles. Gunfights are also still extremely quick and demanding, rewarding headshots above everything. And the Focus Mode, mixed with some very light aim assist, makes getting those headshots feel as smooth and gratifying as it does on the PC original, if a little less precise.</p>

<p id="0IUQhN">“It truly needed to feel like <em>Valorant</em> with a different input mechanism,” Gylfason said in a presentation to journalists and content creators ahead of the console version’s reveal. “We never want players to feel like second-class citizens just based on what platform they choose to play on.”</p>
<p id="N6geBm">But just because Riot’s looking to tap into the console audience with this version of the game doesn’t mean that PC players can’t dip their toes into Xbox and PlayStation once in a while. As part of the console version’s initial announcement, Riot also made it clear that all progress and cosmetics will transfer between players’ accounts on any platform, so you won’t have to rebuy skins no matter where you’re playing. </p>
<p id="NJAg9O">The one thing that won’t transfer is your competitive rank, which will be separate for PC and consoles. This is in large part due to the fact that Riot will not be offering crossplay between PC and console for <em>Valorant</em> — though Xbox and PlayStation players will be able to play together. While aiming on consoles feels great, it doesn’t match the speed and precision of a mouse and keyboard, which is likely why Riot’s keeping those rankings separate. </p>
<p id="mxrxs3"><em>Valorant</em>’s console versions will be playable in a <a href="http://beta.playvalorant.com/">limited beta that begins on June 14</a> on both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, but the developer hasn’t revealed a full release date for the game just yet. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167968/dune-awakening-story-trailer-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="f18orq">It’s been about a year and a half since we first caught wind of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090204/dune-awakening-survival-game-2024"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, the massively multiplayer online survival game set on the planet of Arrakis. On Friday, Funcom released a story-focused trailer at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">Summer Game Fest</a>, teasing that the game will focus on an alternate telling of the story of Paul Atreides — but we’ll have to wait until Gamescom in Aug. 2024 for a gameplay trailer.</p>
<p id="B4oQ4w">The game drops players first-person into the world of Dune (well, at least, the world of Arrakis) where they’ll traverse the desert, using the land and relying on its other inhabitants to survive and thrive. Players will be able to join house Atreides or the Harkonnen, or live a quieter existence as a crafter or trader — but they won’t be able to kill or ride sandworms, unfortunately.</p>
<p id="q9rhMn">The game harnesses the simultaneously desolate and claustrophobic setting of the desert to push players to their survival game limits: You’ll have to avoid the sun, evade sandworms, craft tools, and find water wherever it exists (and yes, that includes enemies’ bodies). But it’s not all treacherous walks through Arrakis — vehicles include thopters, thumpers, and sand bikes, and the Voice is at your disposal should you need to sway your enemies one way or another.</p>
<p id="xMUkrS">While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24080352/best-games-dune-pc-board-tabletop-list">past Dune games</a> have (very successfully, mind you) leaned on real-time strategy to encapsulate the vibe of the books and films, <em>Dune: Awakening</em> promises the most immersive experience yet. We’ll have to see if it delivers on that promise when it’s released on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. </p>

  <p id="FNJat6">Blumhouse Productions is the studio behind many modern horror films, from <em>Paranormal Activity</em> and <em>The Purge</em> to <em>Get Out</em> and <em>Five Night at Freddy’s</em>. Now, the business is expanding with Blumhouse Games, a game publishing arm. Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse, was at Summer Game Fest Friday to announce a slate of six horror games that will release under Blumhouse. These games were chosen to be strange, experimental, and deeply weird, and cover a range of art styles, genres, and methods of presentation.</p>
<p id="z9wdO3">The six games revealed in the Summer Game Fest trailer include:</p>
<p id="m6j7kz"><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>from Vemila: A first-person adventure set on the unholy island of Tormentosa, where protagonist Gabriel must use his sanguinomancer powers in order to explore and survive.</p>
<p id="sROq9L"><em>Grave Seasons</em> from Perfect Garbage: A <em>Stardew Valley</em>-esque farming sim that’s perfect for cozy gaming... as long as you’re willing to put up with the occasional murder and slow burn mystery.</p>
<p id="9Lk1r0"><em>Sleep Awake </em>from Eyes Out<em>: </em>A surreal first-person game that takes place in the distant future, following a girl named Katja as she struggles against dangerous enemies and her own self.</p>
<p id="dvqRqK"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959390/Fear_the_Spotlight/"><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> from Cozy Game Pals</a>: An old-school survival horror game that is heavily inspired by the PlayStation 1 era, where the protagonist must solve the mystery of her local high school while avoiding the scorching daze of the deadly spotlight.</p>

It looks like previous-gen console and Nintendo Switch owners will be left out. The announcement does mark a major milestone for Riot, with <em>Valorant </em>being the first of its major releases to get a console version. “We were adamant that <em>Valorant</em>’s core, competitive gameplay must feel natural on a controller, and —if we couldn’t deliver on that gameplay promise—we had to be prepared to walk away from it.” said Gylfason,” We hope we nailed it, but ultimately, our players will have the final say.” </p><p>The console version of <em>Valorant </em>will feature “custom-built <em>Valorant </em>gameplay” meant to preserve the core experience and feel of the PC version. What that means exactly isn’t clear, though transferring a competitive shooter to consoles is always a bit tricky as controllers are generally believed to be an inferior input method.

Rather, these are stories written by Alan Wake, in the vein of the in-universe, <em>Twilight Zone</em>-like anthology show <em>Night Springs</em>, during his time in the Dark Place, as he struggles to write his way out. So, for instance, while one of the three “episodes” included in the DLC stars a character who looks and sounds very much like Rose Marigold, the Oh Deer Diner waitress who’s also Wake’s self-proclaimed biggest fan, in actuality this is a character that Alan has made up who is known simply as The Waitress—likely based on Rose, but not actually, canonically her.</p><figure id="" data-id="dfc5439b2dee88a8c2127b836c41d2bf" data-recommend-id="image://dfc5439b2dee88a8c2127b836c41d2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A director, played by Remedy creative director Sam Lake, gestures with a coffee cup in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A director, played by Remedy creative director Sam Lake, gestures with a coffee cup in his hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dfc5439b2dee88a8c2127b836c41d2bf" data-recommend-id="image://dfc5439b2dee88a8c2127b836c41d2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A director, played by Remedy creative director Sam Lake, gestures with a coffee cup in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other two chapters here also focus on alternate-reality versions of characters we already know. That woman with the striking red hair you glimpsed in the trailer may look a lot like Jesse Faden from <em>Control</em>, and she is of course played by the same actor, Courtney Hope, but this is The Sibling. And lastly there’s The Actor, played by actual actor Shawn Ashmore, who has played multiple roles in the Remedy-verse of games (Tim Breaker in <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Quantum Break </em>protagonist Jack Joyce) and here, may be playing some variation of those, as well as…himself? My favorite moment in the reveal trailer is the one in which a director, played by none other than Remedy creative director Sam Lake, is directing Shawn in a scene and then, after calling “Cut!”, says, “Shawn, I’m really happy,” suggesting that Shawn Ashmore, in addition to playing a variation of Tim Breaker, is also playing himself here.<br></p><p>This, more than anything else, was what clued me in that <em>Night Springs </em>was aiming to push <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s narrative playfulness even further. I was reminded of <em>Alan Wake’s American Nightmare</em>, the 2012 spin-off of the original <em>Alan Wake </em>which gave Remedy a chance to play with the characters they’d created for the game in ways that fell outside the narrative and tonal boundaries of it. As Clay Murphy, lead writer on the expansion, put it, “<em>Night Springs </em>for us was a chance to experiment with characters, experiences, stories, and tones that players may not be expecting but hopefully are wanting.”</p><figure id="" data-id="3bdbd7991e3c30431e6617b32373a777" data-recommend-id="image://3bdbd7991e3c30431e6617b32373a777" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A comic-book page is displayed in which a character with Shawn Ashmore's likeness seems to experience some sort of cosmic epiphany about abilities he possesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A comic-book page is displayed in which a character with Shawn Ashmore's likeness seems to experience some sort of cosmic epiphany about abilities he possesses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3bdbd7991e3c30431e6617b32373a777" data-recommend-id="image://3bdbd7991e3c30431e6617b32373a777" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A comic-book page is displayed in which a character with Shawn Ashmore's likeness seems to experience some sort of cosmic epiphany about abilities he possesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What we then saw was a very <em>Twilight Zone</em>-esque intro for the “episode” of the DLC that features The Waitress. It sees Mr. Door (the always compelling David Harewood) taking on the Rod Serling role of providing a vaguely ominous introduction for what’s to come. This episode seems to be, in part, an exploration of the ways in which fans can sometimes delude themselves into thinking they matter as much to the celebrity they adore as that celebrity matters to them, with The Waitress dashing off from her job at the diner on a quest—real or imagined—to rescue the writer whose work she so adores.<br></p><p>Like <em>American Nightmare </em>before it, it feels both a tonal shift in terms of the narrative, and a gameplay shift from the more tense, desperate survival horror action of <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>to more freewheeling gunplay. When I asked Kyle Rowley, game director on both <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>and <em>Night Springs</em>, about that creative connection, he acknowledged it, saying that with <em>American Nightmare</em>, as here, “we kind of shifted the tone and shifted the gameplay to be something a bit different, but still working within the frameworks of what we set up in the base game.” In both cases, he suggested, the shift in terms of gameplay was from something more deliberately tense (or, in <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s case at least, “survival horror”) to leaning “into this kind of playful, over-the-top, very stylized work.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6ce56446a95454c176226e85fa48a305" data-recommend-id="image://6ce56446a95454c176226e85fa48a305" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The waitress blasts someone into a bloody mess and sends them flying back through the air with a shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The waitress blasts someone into a bloody mess and sends them flying back through the air with a shotgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ce56446a95454c176226e85fa48a305" data-recommend-id="image://6ce56446a95454c176226e85fa48a305" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The waitress blasts someone into a bloody mess and sends them flying back through the air with a shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>He also said, however, that <em>Night Springs </em>was driven in part by a desire to offer us new playable characters. “When we were originally doing the base game,” Rowley said, “we wanted to have more playable characters. We’ve always experimented with multiple playable characters as much as we can. We have two main characters in the base game and we really wanted more, but then we were like, okay, we wanted to focus on those characters.” But once the long development of <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>was complete, the concept of <em>Night Springs</em> struck them “as a means to kind of get some of those [other] playable characters into <em>Alan Wake 2</em> as a whole.” We won’t have to wait long to see what mysteries await us in the town of Night Springs, as the expansion lands tomorrow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>VALORANT, Riot Games’ electrifying first-person competitive shooter, is evolving. It was confirmed at the Summer Game Fest showcase – alongside a brand-new trailer – that the game is getting a console release. This is huge news for competitive gamers the world over, with Riot Games revealing that on June 14, a limited beta will roll out on PlayStation 5 – but the game is coming to Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-new-generation">A New Generation</h2>



<p>VALORANT is one of the most exciting esports titles in the world, rising to global renown after being released by Riot Games in 2020. It emerged as a solid competitor to Counter-Strike, fusing the traditional mechanics of Valve’s legendary first-person shooter with Overwatch’s hero-based elements.</p>



<p>On June 14, console-based players – on PlayStation 5 – will get their first hands-on experience of VALORANT. In the trailer showcasing this news, Riot Games explained that all the footage captured (which you can see below) was recorded by players using a controller – and <strong>not </strong>a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>This could open up an entirely new avenue for VALORANT esports, which up until now have remained locked firmly in on PC. There’s also a mobile-based version of VALORANT being developed, but that’s a conversation for another day.</p>

<p>In the last few days, Electronic Arts has been peppering social media with cryptic references to M-Corp, a mysterious (and fictional) corporation nestled in the heart of San Vansterdam, the setting of skate., the upcoming open-world skateboarding game. These teasers culminated in the appearance of a website boasting a 1990s aesthetic, complete with old-school pop-ups and retro graphics.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to a trailer that debuted at the Summer Game Fest showcase, everything has been explained.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-skate">Prepare to skate.</h2>



<p>It has been almost 15 years since the last Skate game was released, with Skate 3 dropping way back in 2010. This beloved skateboarding franchise almost faded out of existence save for a few dedicated members of a die-hard community still professing their love for the sandbox skating game, but for the last few years, Electronic Arts has been building a reboot of sorts of the series.</p>



<p>Enter skate., a brand-new open-world experience that boasts the attitude and atmosphere that players came to know and love about the Skate franchise all those years ago. At Summer Game Fest, a fresh trailer was released to showcase where EA has got to with the game’s development, which has been unfolding in the background over a window of several years.</p>



<p>Once the M-Corp tomfoolery had been pushed out of the way, Electronic Arts debuted the <strong>real </strong>trailer for skate., revealing everything we’ve come to expect from the franchise. Not only that but it was also confirmed that playtests (on console) will land in the Fall.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer (still showing pre-pre-alpha gameplay):</p>

<p>Sam Lake took the stage in his usual eccentric fashion, dancing along to music from Alan Wake 2. But he wasn’t here just to give us a show of his dance routine. Lake unveiled Alan Wake 2 Night Springs DLC, featuring additional story elements and characters for the third-person horror adventure!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-alan-wake-2-night-springs">What is Alan Wake 2 Night Springs?</h2>



<p>In Night Springs, you’ll play as familiar yet strange characters from within the Alan Wake 2 universe. They’re slightly different from the main game’s characters, altered by Night Springs.</p>



<p>The DLC appears action-packed, with players taking on various roles, like Alan’s number one fan armed with a shotgun, alongside a few characters from other Remedy titles. It’s certainly a unique take and one that’s a bit more psychedelic overall. </p>

<h2 id="h-when-is-alan-wake-2-night-springs-coming-out">When is Alan Wake 2 Night Springs Coming Out?</h2>



<p>You can play the first story expansion for Alan Wake 2 tomorrow, <strong>June 8</strong>, on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It’s available as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition, which includes the expansion pass for the game.</p>

<p>Gamers have had a few months to settle in with The Finals, the free-to-play first-person shooter that was shadowdropped in December 2023. Despite it not being the biggest hit with players and the game suffering from some teething issues, Nexon revealed that the title will act as a major part of its portfolio going forward. </p>



<p>It was just confirmed that season three of the game will drop on June 13, taking players to Kyoto in 1568 (that’s right, <strong>time travel</strong>) and introducing an all-new map, some fresh weapons, and never-before-seen abilities.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-finals-is-far-from-finished">The Finals Is Far From Finished</h2>



<p>When it was released in December, The Finals suffered with an influx of cheaters, but Embark Studios more or less nipped that in the bud and managed to get a firm enough handle on things – even if the situation wasn’t perfect. In typical fashion, the player count dropped off considerably as The Finals aged, which wasn’t helped by a few competing titles surfacing as 2024 kicked off.</p>



<p>In season three, players will be transported to Japan to take on all comers while wielding period-accurate weapons like katanas. The traditional destructive elements we’ve come to associate with The Finals will be boosted in this new experience.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer showcasing season three of The Finals:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>As the trailer reveals, players will now get access to a bow (along with other weapons), and there’s a new ranked mode and fresh tournaments coming to the game’s competitive ecosystem.</p>

<p>Following a somewhat rocky launch initially, Amazon Game Studios managed to breathe life into their fledgling MMORPG, New World, through massive content updates and the launch of an excellent expansion, Rise of the Angry Earth. But with player numbers dwindling on PC, it’s time for something new. Here is what we know about the New World Aeternum release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-new-world-aeternum-release">When Does New World Aeternum Release?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the Summer Game Fest, we know the New World Aeternum release date is <strong>October 15, 2024</strong>. The MMORPG, which first launched in September 2021, will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year. </p>



<p>Alongside the console launch, we’ll likely see complete controller support on PC. If you’ve been waiting to play the MMO with a controller—a chance to lounge around and explore the world of Aeternum in all its glory—then now is your chance to return to the fold.</p>



<p>New World features one of the genre’s most impressive resource-gathering and crafting systems, and it’s one of the reasons why I returned to the game frequently. </p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-check-new-world-server-population-and-status">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-check-new-world-server-population-and-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Check New World Server Population and Status</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-what-else-is-amazon-game-studios-working-on">What Else is Amazon Game Studios Working On?</h2>



<p>Alongside New World Aeternum launching on consoles this year, Amazon Game Studios is working on a handful of other titles. For one, they’re working on a Tomb Raider game. Secondly, there are talks of a full-fledged Lord of the Rings MMORPG running on the same engine that powers New World.</p>



<p>We’ll know more about these projects in the coming days and weeks, and then we’ll make sure you know!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It was a year ago at Summer Game Fest 2023 that we saw our first extended look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>, and now, Remedy is back on Geoff Keighley's stage to give a first look at Night Springs, the first of two Alan Wake 2 expansions set for 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">In Night Springs, players will take on the role of three different characters, each inspired by characters from Remedy's past. This includes The Waitress, who looks like Rose Marigold; The Sibling, who looks like Control's Jesse Faden; and The Actor, who looks like Tim Breaker (but let's not beat around the bush--he also looks like Quantum Break's Jack Joyce.)</p><p dir="ltr">Across three "episodes" of Night Springs, players will live through a trio of Alan's failed attempts to get out of the Dark Place during his long stay there from 2010 to 2023. Check out the trailer for yourself, which, among other fun head-scratchers, seems to confirm Shawn Ashmore's character is playing himself in perhaps Remedy's most meta maneuver yet.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1s_2hqbx8k" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q1s_2hqbx8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Alan Wake 2's Night Springs DLC launches tomorrow, June 8, on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and the Epic Games Store.</span></p>

                <p>Davey Wreden, the creator of The Stanley Parable, has revealed his next game: Wanderstop. A dramatic shift from his previous work, Wanderstop appears to be a deconstruction of the cozy game genre.</p><p>Revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest 2024</a>, Wanderstop follows a fallen fighter named Alta who leaves behind her former life to run a cozy tea shop. When not tending to her garden and foraging in the magical forest, she manages a small tea shop where she tends to customers passing through. However, not all is quite a cute and cozy as it seems.</p><p>Though Wanderstop is narrative-focused and has farming sim elements, Alta's violent past seems to haunt her. In the game's YouTube trailer description, the studio writes:</p><p>"Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory."</p><p>Wanderstop appears to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive and is listed as "coming soon."</p>
