		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct stream brought a bit one hour drop of new information about Masuhiro Sakurai’s latest game, digging into changes both big and small for the game, revealing Top Ride and the brand new Road Trip mode, digging into specific menu settings, revealing a big set of Amiibo, and more.</p>
<p>A global online demo is set to take place at two points in November, on 8th-9th November and on 15th-16th November at 8AM-2PM UK time (UTC) on the first day, and then 12AM-6AM and 3PM-9PM on the second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct #2 10.23.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZHYjYHHiBM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Top Ride, the top-down racing style, has returned alongside the more kart racer-style Air Ride, and the vehicular combat stylings of City Trial. Compared to the GameCube original, there’s now a follow cam and the ability for all players to have their own view of the world, which will really help with the scale and the scope of the many stages featured in the game. Additionally, since this now uses the full selection Air Ride vehicles, and has two control methods so you can race however feels more natural.</p>
<p>Air Ride is the main racing mode, though, and there’s some big news here as well. There’s nine original circuits for this game, but there’s also all nine of the original game’s circuits included as well, from Fantasy meadows and Celestial Valley to Sky Sands. You’ll need to earn these original circuits, but they’ve all been rebuilt in their original layouts with new graphics –&nbsp;given the faster cruising speed in this sequel, the lap times will be a bit faster.</p>

<p>City Trial is the vehicular combat mode, gathering up stat points to enhance your vehicle before a final Stadium battle takes place. A new Team Battle mode takes the 16-player lobbies and splits them into two teams to work together, and then everyone to face off in the same Stadium.</p>
<p>A new game mode, Road Trip, which combines Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial together in a string of challenges to take on, going head-to-head with rival characters. It builds up to encounters with a mysterious figure that provides some narrative impetus to this game’s solo play.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of this is meant to be enjoyed in multiplayer. There’s up to four player split screen, and when with two players you can choose the direction of the split-screen, which is neat. What’s good to hear is that Switch 1 controllers and the GameCube recreation controller will all be supported.</p>
<p>Heading online, you can do so socially, meeting up with friends in the Paddock, a lobby space where you run around, get to watch a big screen, select music and just hang.</p>
<p>For competitively minded players, you’ll have an online license that shows your Global Power Rating –&nbsp;literally a number of how many people you’re better than –&nbsp;and a coloured shape that acts as your rank. This rank is set individually per game mode, and can affect how City Trial matches play out. You’ll be able to customise your license with fresh backgrounds, and even sparkles.</p>
<p>Beyond all this, Sakurai-san regularly diverted to share new copy abilities, vehicles and riders. There’s a lot of characters to choose from here, including… Rock (the literal rock) and Rick, the hamster. There’s also a Transform Star vehicle, which swaps between star form and bike form modes (which feels a bit OP?), top speed Formula Star, jumping Hop Star, and so many more.</p>
<p>A full set of five Kirby Air Rider amiibo are on the way for Kirby, Bandana Waddle Dee, Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Chef Kawasaki, all with swappable Star vehicles. The Tank Star can also have its tracks reoriented. The amiibo let you save and train up an AI, but can also just be scanned to change the pose and models featured in your main menu cursor.</p>

<p>Here’s some more bullet point details:</p>
<ul>
<li>All localisation languages have both male and female announcers.</li>
<li>You can set a different announcer for matches and story narration.</li>
<li>Time Trial records are tracked per machine.</li>
<li>There are no online leaderboards.</li>
<li>City Trial has a Free Run mode to let you explore Skyah, test vehicles and more. Field Events won’t happen in this mode, though.</li>
<li>A Photo Mode is available throughout the game.</li>
<li>A Stadiums-only mode is available separate from City Trial</li>
<li>You can remove stadiums from City Trial, if you don’t like them, or set filters.</li>
<li>The VS. King Dedede Stadium has been reimagined as VS. Boss against the transforming Robo Dedede.</li>
<li>The Checklist returns with rewards for certain game missions and achievements, filling in a picture puzzle.</li>
<li>There’s a new vehicle decoration feature called My Machine.</li>
<li>A Machine Market lets you use earned currency to buy the designs of other players.</li>
<li>Riders can also be styled up with headware.</li>
<li>The earned currency is Miles from actively driving.</li>
<li>You’ll earn “gummies” from defeating rivals, and can mess around with them like a gummy-obsessed Scrooge McDuck.</li>
<li>The soundtrack comes from Shogo Sakai and Noriyuki Iwadare.</li>
<li>You can customise how likely tracks are to be played.</li>
<li>The main menu is themed after a desk</li>
<li>You can remap buttons, to the extend you could play the game one-handed.</li>
<li>Colour filters are in place to help with colourblindness.</li>
<li>You can change the FOV, reduce camera shake and more.</li>
<li>DLC is&nbsp;<em>not</em> planned for Kirby Air Riders – everything they want to put in the game is already there.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-launch-update-november-10/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-to-launch-%E2%80%98wake-of-the-water%E2%80%99-update-on-november-10.1332718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>German developer Keen Games announced that its popular survival game Enshrouded will receive its largest free content update on November 10.</p>



<p>The update, titled Wake of the Water, introduces dynamic water as well as swimming, a fishing mini-game, watering plants via watering can or irrigation, terraforming, and basebuilding within, around, and under water. Players will find new fish and land-based critters, like Veilwater Snapjaws, crabs, and capybaras. The latter can be tamed for those looking forward to having a capybara chilling at the base.</p>



<p>Wake of the Water introduces many more improvements to Enshrouded, though. The user interface has been reworked, and items have been rebalanced across the whole game. To begin with, weapon stats now match their name and visuals (e.g., Ice Coated Daggers now properly deal ice damage instead of just cut and pierce). Weapon durability has increased and now scales with both level and rarity, improving weapon longevity. That said, existing (pre-update) weapons will retain their current stats, so only new drops after this update will show the improvements.</p>



<p>Numerous new weapons have been added to enemy drops, which now scale with enemy level and range in rarity from common to legendary. Players can also craft any lore weapon previously unlocked, at any game stage and any item level. This lets fans upgrade favorites (like the light-emitting Whailing Blade) as they progress, countering unlucky RNG and supporting all playstyles. Armor, rings, and food items also received stat tweaks, bolstering their relevance and gameplay effectiveness for all classes and builds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Keen Games also fixed the long-time bug where loot chests could be repeatedly looted via server reload. Passive HP, stamina, and mana regeneration have also been adjusted, resulting in decreased regeneration in the mid-to-late game. This change is meant to prevent trivializing combat encounters while encouraging Enshrouded players to plan ahead by preparing potions, eating meals, etc.</p>



<p>The Wake of the Water update introduces some new consumable and decorative items and quality-of-life features: expect new items that provide buffs, ranging from food to decor, along with the ability to label chests and signs.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">over four million players as part of its player base</a>, the Enshrouded team is slowly but surely getting closer to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned 1.0 launch on PC and consoles in 2026</a>. Will you jump in for this update or wait for the full version?</p>

			<p>If you had to rank the three video game console manufacturers based on how well they're doing commercially in 2025, the answer for numbers one and two could differ from person to person, with some seeing Nintendo as solidly in first, and others seeing PlayStation. But without a doubt, Microsoft and Xbox are in third place, and it's from this position, from well behind its two biggest competitors, that Microsoft and Xbox management are reportedly asking its studios to hit profit margin goals far above the industry average.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok">Bloomberg</a> shows that Microsoft and Xbox are setting <strong>30% profit margin</strong> goals for its internal studios. This isn't for every project, as the report clarifies that "<em>Not every project is expected to hit the 30% profit threshold,</em>" per Bloomberg's sources, "<em>but many Xbox developers and groups have been presented with the new target</em>."</p>



<p>The average profit margins for the rest of the industry have fallen between 17% and 22% since 2018, per the report and analysis from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Neil Barbour, analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, even distinguished 30% or higher margins as the kind of goal you'd set if you were "<em>a publisher that is really nailing it.</em>"</p>







<p>Thanks to court documents we saw as part of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">closing out its Activision Blizzard acquisition in 2023</a>, we know that just two years ago, the profit margin for Xbox and the gaming division sat at just 12% for most of 2022. Once that merger closed in October 2023, Bloomberg's report claims that Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, implemented the new 30% goal, as if to say that Xbox needed to start making back the money that was spent on making franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush first-party franchises.</p>



<p>Gambles like putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">haven't necessarily paid off though</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">at least that's how it seems</a>, since in the last two years after that 30% profit margin goal was set, Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">laid off thousands</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">employees within its gaming division</a>, closed <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">its own studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled several highly anticipated projects</a>. </p>



<p>It's worth pointing out that the layoffs aren't entirely due to Xbox Game Studios not hitting the profit margin. We know that while that goal exists, Microsoft has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">investing more into AI</a> and would seemingly close, cut, and sell off any project to free up capital to invest even more. But knowing that the company's leadership is asking its game studios to hit well above the industry average does help to explain how leadership gets to the conclusion that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">mass layoffs</a> and publishing its first-party titles on competing platforms are necessary.</p>



<p>Of course, you could argue that Amy Hood and Microsoft are setting the gaming division up to fail, because again, Microsoft is nowhere close to being the industry-leading titan we saw in its Xbox 360 days. The sentiment that Microsoft wants out of the video game business is one that continues to grow online, and if that's the end goal for Microsoft, then its playbook of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cutting projects from its expert developers</a>, setting unreasonable profit margin goals, and constantly upsetting its consumer base with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">price hikes on products</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">services</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">pushing features nobody asked for</a> is a solid one.</p>



<p>The report continues to say that the projects likely to get priority within Microsoft and Xbox will be "<em>cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls</em>," which also sounds like we're in for cheaply made games and live service bets that don't try to do anything other than make as much money as possible.</p>



<p>A Microsoft spokesperson quoted in the report adds, "<em>We look at the business as a whole, balancing creativity, innovation, and sustainability across a diverse portfolio of offerings. As with any creative business, sometimes that means making hard decisions and stopping work on things that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, and shifting resources toward the projects that are more aligned with our direction and priorities</em>."</p>

              <p>Halloween is right around the corner, and one of the best ways to amp up your spooky nights (or any weekend, literally) is with a powerful outdoor speaker. You need something that brings life to your parties without that overwhelming bass or distortion, and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/">The Soundcore Boom 3i does a great job at all of that, and right now, you can grab it for significantly less</a>. It’s currently sitting at just $89 on Amazon, after a massive $51 discount. This offer is only available on the Black option, and the deal wraps up soon. Get your orders in before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Water, Dust, and Drop Resistant</h2>
<p>This portable speaker is lightweight and easy to carry around; just about the size of a water bottle. You can toss it in your backpack or just throw it over your shoulder using the detachable strap and get going. But despite the compact size, the speaker packs serious power. It pushes out an impressive 50W of sound with bass as deep as 56Hz. The BassUp 2.0 and DSP tech come together to deliver an immersive experience where all the highs and lows are captured exceptionally well. Audio will stay clean, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up.</p>
<p>The Soundcore Boom 3i is specifically made for some wild adventures. It comes with a full IP68 waterproof and dustproof rating, plus can float upright in water.

Take it to the beach or relax by the pool with your favorite slow songs without any worries.</p>



<p>As for the battery life, you’re looking at up to 16 hours of playback on a single charge. That’s more than enough for a whole night of jamming. And for when you need even bigger sound for larger gatherings, you can easily pair two of these using the TWS mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/">Some other useful extras include Voice Amplifier, Emergency Alarm, and Buzz Clean mode, all accessible through the Soundcore app.</a> Altogether, the Soundcore Boom 3i offers impressive audio in a compact build.

<p>After a lot of feedback on the XP farm nerfs, Battlefield 6 developers have revealed that progression is being tested on PvE and curated servers. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 XP farms and bot lobbies were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed</a> recently, after players were seen using them to primarily earn XP, player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.” However, since then, a lot of feedback has poured in, with players calling for solo lobbies for a more relaxed experience and the option to play as they wish. The developers have now responded to this feedback, revealing they will be testing progression in some curated BF6 servers. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-will-now-feature-progression-eligible-or-not-eligible-lobbies">Battlefield 6 Will Now Feature Progression Eligible or Not Eligible Lobbies </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/they-just-keep-winning-steam-was-already-beating-every-store-at-finding-games-and-it-just-got-better-with-custom-calendars-showing-recent-and-upcoming-games-valve-thinks-youll-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, community manager Shepard has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/811336158986581167/?ctp=2#c599667160179125243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the feedback on the Battlefield 6 XP farm nerfs. Shepard first spoke about how the devs understand that many players “want full progression in solo/co-op and on curated custom servers—not just in matchmade PvP.” Some players have also expressed frustration with the game’s messaging regarding progression eligibility, whereas others worry about stat/leaderboard integrity and bot-farm exploits.</p>



<p>The developers understand that players with less time prefer low-stress PvE and still want meaningful unlocks, which is why they are enabling account XP and unlock/unlock-track progression in solo/co-op, as well as a curated list of community servers. However, to safeguard the integrity, K/D, leaderboards, and certain mastery tallies won’t update in these spaces during the test. If the data indicates low exploit/noise on these servers, they will expand eligibility. </p>



<p>At the same time, the developers don’t want XP farms in Battlefield 6, hence some anti-farm guardrails have been put in place. These include minimum difficulty, activity checks (AFK/loop detection), mixed target requirements, and sensible XP-per-minute caps. Any server that raises flags regarding exploits will lose its “Progression Eligible” status until the issue is fixed. Moreover, clear labelling will be put in place for Progression Eligible or Not Eligible on the browser and pre-match screens, with a short tooltip explaining the rationale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If Star Trek is the optimistic dream of what humanity could become, The Outer Worlds 2 is the nihilistic nightmare of what it will probably be. Thankfully, both make for highly entertaining material to explore, and this second run through Obsidian’s corporate dystopia is a significant step up from the original. With a story that’s more grounded and interesting, significantly more competent combat, and an irresistible RPG grind, I had a blast putting my fist through the kafkaesque final frontier alongside a cast of memorable companions, even when a weak first act and some truly terrible enemy variety made the going less exciting. Across the more than 65 hours my completionist playthrough took, I fought with myself over moral dilemmas, giggled at absurd worldbuilding, and brought several would-be dictators to their knees – that’s exactly what the for-profit space doctor ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 is a good old-fashioned single-player, open-world RPG in the same vein as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review"><u>Dragon Age</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review"><u>Fallout</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review"><u>Avowed</u></a>. Y’know, the ones where you’re an especially cool person given undue authority to insert yourself into the various conflicts of the world and decide the fate of all living beings while collecting a cast of snarky companions in the process? Well, as a followup to 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review"><u>The Outer Worlds</u></a> and a sorta, kinda followup to 2010’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/19/fallout-new-vegas-review"><u>Fallout: New Vegas</u></a>, Obsidian is at it again with a very similar blueprint here. It lays out a new dystopia to shoot your way through as you level up, grab every piece of loot within reach, and solve all the galaxy’s long-standing problems in no time at all. It’s not the most novel concept, to be sure, but it’s one I love that we simply don’t get enough of, and pulls it off better than the vast majority of recent attempts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequel returns to a wonderfully satirical alternate reality where unfettered capitalism has conquered the stars to turn majestic celestial bodies into tacky outdoor strip malls. Though it shares the same pessimistic vision for the future, it ditches the first game’s Halcyon system for a different part of the galaxy called Arcadia, with a fresh batch of planets for you to single-handedly decide the fate of. More prominent than the new planets to explore though is a distinct shift in tone. While there’s still plenty of goofy jokes and ways to make your trek through corporate-owned space completely absurd, this sequel is much more interested in telling a grounded story – one that focuses squarely on the politics of Arcadia’s various factions and repeatedly forces you to make judgement calls on which of these deeply flawed organizations is the lesser evil.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While there are still plenty of goofs, this sequel tells a more grounded story.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That bet on more serious topics and the delicate balance of warring political entities is one that pays off, thankfully, and I found myself genuinely torn by who to side with and even frustrated by my inability to appeal to the better angels of these selfish, power hungry monsters, which is exactly what I look for in these kinds of make-your-mark-on-the-world games. The way you’re positioned as a central figure who will decide which of these power-hungry factions will emerge victorious is quite reminiscent of one of my favorite Obsidian RPGs, Fallout: New Vegas, and just like with that one, there aren’t any truly good answers here. Auntie’s Choice is a supposedly freedom-forward capitalistic organization that actually functions as an oppressive, monopolistic pseudo-government that would make Helldivers 2 proud, while The Protectorate is an openly fascistic society that seeks to suppress any thought diverging from their orthodoxy, and choosing which of these two vipers nests gets to control the fate of an entire planet is rarely straightforward. Even the groups that seem more reasonable like the Order of the Ascendant, which uses science and math to predict the future as it tries to guide humanity towards enlightenment, will get caught casually committing atrocities to prevent some supposed future they’ve seen through their abacus, which made me ponder if their way of life was actually any better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When The Outer Worlds 2 is putting the political jockeying front and center, it’s sick as hell, and without question has some of the coolest worldbuilding and satisfyingly perilous moral dilemmas I’ve seen in some time – but it takes its sweet time getting there, mostly focusing on this conflict in its second half. For the first half of the story, you’ll instead prioritize a humdrum revenge quest I cared about so little that I actually forgot it was even the first act’s main focus by the time I reached credits. In fairness, they do use this early time to introduce you to the principle movers and shakers in Arcadia while you seek vengeance, which sets it up for a much stronger second act, but for the first 20 or so hours felt like the main story was quite slow and unengaging. It does rally if you can hang in there for a bit, but I wish it was more consistent throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area that is much more consistent is the absolutely gripping RPG climb, which sunk its teeth into me from moment one with a near-constant stream of interesting decisions to make about who my character was and how in the heck he was going to be able to save the galaxy. With only two skill points earned per level to spend across 12 skills that make you good at everything from Leadership to Lockpicking, you’ve got some serious decisions to make about what you want to excel in. This becomes an even more stressful decision once you take a look at the enormous list of perks, which can only be unlocked if you’ve sufficiently bought into the relevant prerequisite skills. That includes things like the ability to pickpocket others, which only becomes available to those who have leveled up Sneak, or another perk that allows you to sell increasingly unbelievable lies as you improve your Speech skill. You’re only allowed to buy 15 of these bad boys before you hit the level cap of 30, so planning out your ideal spacefaring badass and making sure you’ve got the skills you need to get the job done becomes very compelling, and I found myself hungrily looking for enemies to kill and side quests to complete to feed my XP habit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The absolutely gripping RPG climb sunk its teeth into me from moment one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the best part of this power climb is how it manifests in unexpected ways in the form of flaws. The Outer Worlds 2 tracks the things your character does in search of certain trends, then provides opportunities for you to lean into those quirks by offering benefits that come at a cost. For example, if you tend to steal a lot, you might be offered the Kleptomaniac flaw, which allows you to sell all your stolen goods for more money, but also makes your character steal things automatically from time-to-time, which can get you in quite a bit of trouble with the locals. Alternatively, if you skip through a lot of dialogue, you’ll be offered the Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome flaw, which gives you bonus XP but forces you to choose all your dialogue options under a very short time limit before choosing an option for you randomly. Each of these has pretty massive implications on how you play and are irreversible, which can lead to all sorts of hilarious mistakes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on in my playthrough, I was tempted by a Jack of All Trades flaw offered to me, which gave me a whole extra skill point every time I leveled up, but came at the cost of never being able to raise a skill more than one point above my lowest rated skill. This seemed like a pretty fair trade at the time, but I quickly realized that my character was now just bad at pretty much everything and constantly ran into roadblocks in my journey that made me thoroughly regret my decision (although it actually made for a pretty great way to play for the purposes of this review, since I got a taste of being semi-good at every skill on the roster). Even when these choices went on to haunt me for the rest of my playthrough, I couldn’t help but love them, and if anything it made me excited for subsequent playthroughs where I could learn from the error of my ways and perhaps stumble across some new flaws to saddle myself with.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 Character Creation - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor, you spend most of your time exploring the wild frontiers of untamed planets while staring down the barrel of a rifle and/or stabbing jugulars, and this is an area of significant improvement since the last time we were let loose in this setting. While the first Outer Worlds was mostly passable when it came to combat, this sequel manages to level up to “generally enjoyable” with snappier gunplay, improved mobility that has you sliding and double jumping around, and, most importantly, an arsenal of weapons that feels much better suited for the gloriously goofy sci-fi setting. I found so many weird and unexpected weapons with unique effects, like a shotgun that fires shots completely silently and instantly melts its target so bodies can’t be found (especially useful when trying to go undetected), and another weapon that started out weak but leveled up as I scored kills until is was an absolute beast (and which made me want to rewatch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solo-leveling-season-1-review"><u>Solo Leveling</u></a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only that, but there are a ton of ways to customize your weapons and armor with loads of mods you can buy and craft. Those do things like reduce your damage output overall to gain explosive rounds or better protect yourself against a certain elemental effect – and this is without me going into some of the truly bonkers and unique options that I won’t spoil here! They really do a lot more to make your rewards for exploring and completing quests more interesting and befitting of the silly world around you, which makes all the difference in the world. As you might expect, combat still has its quirks, like how the reticle on weapons often feels a bit more slippery than I’d like and how enemies would sometimes manage to hit me in melee even though I’d double-jumped a meter over their head. If you’re (unrealistically) hoping this has caught up with the best practices of a proper FPS like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>, then you’re likely going to be disappointed, but it’s still at least a huge step up compared to the average open-world RPG, and that’s something.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest letdown with combat is definitely the enemy variety.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest letdown with combat is definitely the enemy variety, which usually features two or three types of wild animal on each world that you see way too much of for several hours at a time, alongside your standard humanoid enemies and a few robotic foes here and there. You’ll encounter a whole helluva lot of Raptidon creatures from the original, for example, and I found myself extremely sick of seeing them before I’d even left the first planet, much less by the time I entered the final stretch and was still running into them. It’s pretty disappointing that in a galaxy filled with so much promise, there’s practically no surprises in terms of the adversaries you face after only a few hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even worse, The Outer Worlds 2 does the same thing as Avowed where all the enemies you encounter are finite and placed in specific spots in the world, and once you kill them they’re gone for good. This means that eventually you’ll be running through large swathes of the map utterly devoid of life, which makes areas feel very empty and also removes any possibility for random and unexpected encounters to occur. I’m not entirely sure why Obsidian keeps taking this approach, as I thought it was a detriment in Avowed as well, but they’ve stuck with it here and I still don’t dig it. That said, there’s at least a pretty decent fast travel system that let me jump around to important areas rather than backtracking through completely dead space, which I feel like I did a fair amount in Avowed. So even though it was disappointing to see this approach return, I ran into the ramifications of it far less frequently.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of running around, The Outer Worlds 2 has four main destinations, each with their own particular vibe, usually dictated by whichever faction has controlling interest, from the monk-like temples hidden in the snow on Cloister to the busy backwaters in the jungles of Eden. Exploring each is a lot of fun as you kill stuff, learn about the world, recruit new members to your party, and feverishly check off every quest on the map. I felt like I was always finding someone interesting to talk to or some loot just out of reach for me to puzzle through. All of that usually made for a good time, apart from the previously mentioned enemy repetition and the empty map that results from killing them, which does make for a very feast and famine situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like real life, a story-focused RPG is only as good as the companions who follow you around, judging your every decision, and this is one area where The Outer Worlds 2 most improves upon its predecessor. The six mostly-memorable characters you befriend and travel alongside each stand as a representative of the respective organization from which they hail. For example, Tristan, a heavily-armored brute serves as the group’s cop, eager to carry out his authoritarian government’s twisted form of justice on pretty much everyone you meet, while Inez, an entrepreneurial combat medic, is constantly reminding you of the virtues of the so-called free market enterprises she grew up with. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite RPGs</h3><p>If you're looking to get transported to another world, here are my the best escape destinations I can think of!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-mass-effect-2-review"><u>Mass Effect</u></a> and Fallout before it, this tactic of making your party members serve as mouthpieces for each of the world’s factions is incredibly effective. It both immediately makes each companion’s worldview crystal clear and also helps you understand the powers at play and the philosophical disagreements that become pretty important for you to know as you start making decisions that massively alter the balance of power. Even if you’re not reading every journal entry you stumble across or following every bit of dialogue, it’s almost impossible not to become intimately familiar with Arcadia’s most important players just by absorbing it from your comrades, which makes it much easier to care about the story and the ultimate fate of the galaxy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there are still some companions who are a little less compelling, like Niles, an engineer who is mostly defined by a revenge quest that can resolve itself fairly early on in your journey, leaving little reason to bring him with you, and Valerie, a robot assistant who has some pretty amusing one-liners, but feels fairly disconnected from the story compared to the others. Unfortunately, these characters are the ones who appear earliest in the story, which makes a fairly bad first impression compared to how much better they eventually get. Although, now that I think about it… that is sorta a time-honored tradition in RPGs of this kind, isn’t it?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 doesn’t try to rewrite Obsidian’s RPG playbook, but it’s yet another strong refinement, with smoother combat, diabolically compelling buildcrafting and loot, and a story that immediately made me want to start again to see an alternate outcome. The sluggish first act and lack of enemy variety make it a bit of a slog at certain times, but once its story of political intrigue kicks in and the new flaws and perks system gets its claws in you, it can be quite hard to put down. All these improvements put The Outer Worlds 2 that much closer to being the Fallout: New Vegas successor we hoped this series would be, and that’s worth getting excited about.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The bit of reporting I'm about to relay to you probably isn't surprising, but it's worth making sure you've got a pillow on standby to scream into once you've digested it. Microsoft, they of more money than a company could ever need or know what to do with, have reportedly spent the last two years pushing Xbox to deliver profit margins which are well above the industry average. Cue all of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everwild-screenshots-leak-after-microsoft-cancellation-and-youd-seemingly-have-been-a-walking-garden-centre">cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">shutterings</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins">Bloomberg</a> have reported this profits push, which they cite as having seen company execs set an across-the-board goal of 30% profit margins, or "accountability margins" as they're known in Microsoft corpospeak. Not every individual game or project is expected to hit the 30% mark, but lots of developers across Xbox have been made aware of the target, the report claims.</p>
<p>The 30% goal reportedly came into force from autumn 2023, when Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood's team took up a more prominent role, with Xbox moving away from a past which Bloomberg's sources claim wasn't as doggedly driven by financial metrics as the be all and end all.</p>
<p>To put the margin being aimed for in context, Bloomberg turn to data analytics firm S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, who put the average profit margin in the games industry at between 17% and 22% in recent years. Xbox's profit margins over the past six years are cited as has having landed somewhere between the 10% and 20% marks. According to S&amp;P analyst Neil Barbour, hitting 30% or more is "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it".</p><p>Along with the move we've already seen Xbox make towards cross-platform releases which aim to maximise the cash a game can bring in, rather than using it as a tool to try and tempt players onto Xbox consoles or Game Pass, the report cites sources as having pointed to an increasing risk averseness in terms of the games Microsoft green light as a likely consequence going forwards. Basically, if it ain't massive and dripping with clear cash-grabbing potential, it might not get made. Meanwhile, on the hardware front, that division's suggested to possibly be in line for "a significant rethinking".</p>
<p>It's a state of affairs you could guess pretty easily just by reading the tea leaves of the corp's moves over the past year and a bit, but damn if it isn't still depressing to have the unnecessarily greedy motivation behind it all reported in black and white.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The five weeks between now and Black Friday are going to move way faster than you think — don’t they always? So when crazy-huge discounts pop up ahead of schedule, it’s smart to do some early-bird shopping. Here’s a fat, tasty worm of a tech deal that’s live now at Amazon: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/">Save 72% off the price of this 17-inch HP Flagship laptop bundled with Windows 11 Pro, an 8-core Intel processor, and more.</a> It’s just $720 — a huge dropdown from its list price of $2,600.</p>
<p>Will there be laptop deals on Black Friday and all throughout Cyber Week? Of course, and probably more than you could shake a stick at. But we can’t swear there will be one with specs like this HP Flagship: huge anti-glare HD+ display, processor hitting speeds up to 3.80GHz, UHD graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for built-in storage. This deal could be a great opportunity to buy now so you can sit back and enjoy cold turkey sandwiches while everyone else is scrambling on Black Friday.</p>

<h2>Ready for Anything</h2>
<p>A laptop with the specs and features of this 17-inch HP Flagship saves you the trouble of sorting through endless comparisons to decide which potential new laptop would be best for specific tasks.

The big display with 250-nit brightness and 1.4 million pixels combined with fast WiFi 6 and integrated Intel UHD Graphics is ready to roll.</p>
<p>It’s a perfect laptop for high schoolers or college students thanks to its slim, lightweight body for easy transport, long battery life and HP Fast Charge that gets it back up from 0% to 50% in just 45 minutes, and the preloaded Windows 11 Pro that comes with Microsoft Copilot.

                <p>With Fallout Day finally here and the internet buzzing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">talk of remakes, remasters</a>, and maybe even a brand-new entry in Bethesda's iconic post-apocalyptic series, one Hollywood star has jumped into the conversation. Actor Danny Trejo, the fan-favorite tough guy from From Dusk Till Dawn, Machete, and Spy Kids--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/check-out-this-fallout-4-danny-trejo-character/1100-6433701/" data-ref-id="1100-6433701">and huge Fallout fan</a>--made his opinion crystal clear <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on social media</a>: He wants Fallout: New Vegas back--and now.</p><p>Trejo, who actually voiced the ghoul mechanic Raul Alfonso Tejada in New Vegas, commented on Bethesda's official Instagram post with, "Remaster New Vegas boss!" followed by a fire emoji. That message sent shockwaves through the Wasteland, garnering almost 1,600 likes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trejo's wish wasn’t included in Bethesda’s official lineup for Fallout Day. During the celebration, the studio is set to show off more from Fallout 76's upcoming Burning Springs expansion out this December, and yes, that includes Walton Goggins returning as The Ghoul from the hit Fallout TV series. There are also updates coming to Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter, plus new content via Creations, Bethesda's name for officially supported community mods. Fans can also expect merch drops, live events, and a post-show dedicated to the ever-passionate Fallout community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664" data-ratio="0.64071856287425" data-width="1169" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Instagram/Lan Pitts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Fallout has had a pretty good year in reaching fans outside the games, partially thanks to the success of the Prime Video show. It even had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-teases-fallout-and-five-nights-at-freddys-halloween-horror-nights-houses/1100-6533789/" data-ref-id="1100-6533789">its own haunted house at this year's Halloween Horror Nights</a> at Universal Studios. Professional sports are getting in on the fun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pro-hockey-team-is-hosting-fallout-night-in-partnership-with-bethesda/1100-6535586/" data-ref-id="1100-6535586">themed jerseys for Fallout Night</a>.</p><p>Still, the rumor mill is spinning faster than a Gatling laser. With The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered now out and whispers of a Fallout 3 remaster having leaked back in 2023, fans are convinced that New Vegas might not be far behind. And while everyone's dreaming of a full Fallout 5 reveal, Bethesda has made it clear that it won't happen anytime soon, as the team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">focusing on The Elder Scrolls VI first</a>.</p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard reminded fans earlier this year that the studio doesn't want to rush its next big project. "We totally get the desire for a new single-player game," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he told YouTuber MrMattyPlays last year</a>. "But these things take time--we just want to get it right."</p><p>The last mainline Fallout release was Fallout 4 back in 2015, followed by Fallout 76 in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">which found a new surge of popularity thanks to Prime Video's Fallout TV show</a>. So while the vault door to Fallout 5 may stay sealed for a while longer, it's clear Bethesda wants every future entry to be a true nuclear event in gaming history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Massive Entertainment, the studio behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>and last year's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, is being hit by layoffs, but the way in which the news was shared is...interesting, to say the least.</p>

<p>Over on Massive's <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official X account</a>, the studio says it's "recently realigned [its] teams and resources to strengthen [its] roadmap". In order to "support this transition", Massive says it has introduced what it calls a "voluntary career transition program".</p>

<p>This program, Massive says, will enable "eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms". Essentially, this sounds a lot like Massive staff are being offered the opportunity to jump before they're pushed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-division-2-massive-entertainment.jpg?itok=HunmFSX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-division-2-massive-entertainment.jpg?itok=oc4xKfsV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>studio Massive Entertainment is being hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>One rather imagines that there probably isn't a path for Massive employees to turn down this "voluntary career transition program", so to me, this rather sounds like Ubisoft trying to shift the blame for the layoffs onto the employees themselves, which is pretty grim.</p>

<p>In any case, cutting through the jungle of corporate jargon on offer here, the reality is that Massive Entertainment is losing employees. The studio does, however, say that it "remains fully committed to [its] roadmap", and that&nbsp;<em>The Division 3&nbsp;</em>is still on track.</p>

<p>These layoffs come just a day or so after Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" rel="nofollow">announced staff reductions at&nbsp;<em>Trials&nbsp;</em>developer RedLynx</a>, although the language used in that case wasn't quite so horrifyingly dystopian as Massive's missive.</p>

<p>They also follow a disappointing year or two for the French publisher, with Massive's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">disappointing in sales terms</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">failing to make up for losses</a> elsewhere in the company.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-bazzite-steamos-linux-performance-2000638543</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/people-are-turning-this-1-000-windows-handheld-into-a-super-steam-deck-and-getting-way-better-performance.1332631/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is a $1,000 Windows gaming handheld <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">that gets a lot right but still leaves some things to be desired</a> when it comes to top-end performance. It turns out the secret to unlocking its true potential is using a Linux-based, Steam-like OS called Bazzite. Some tech YouTubers have already demonstrated how the swap boosts framerates and ease-of-use without sacrificing versatility.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ambCqcFuexk">Cyber Dopamine</a> is one of the content creators who’s been experimenting with the change-up (via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/linux-supercharges-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-higher-fps-smoother-performance-and-a-big-win-for-handheld-gaming"><em>Windows Central</em></a>). His results are impressive and he makes a compelling case for going the Bazzite route. At 17W he was getting only 47fps for <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</em> with Windows, but 62fps on Bazzite with similar settings. <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> was a similar experience, with 50fps on Windows and 62fps on Bazzite. Plus you get the bonus of an easy-on-the-eyes media cross-bar similar to Steam Big Picture Mode.</p>

   <p>But boosted performance isn’t the only perk of Bazzite on the Xbox Ally X. Cyber Dopamine also points to improved usability thanks to the Linux-based OS catering more directly to the gaming experience. In addition to a smoother-looking interface with no random pop-ups, things as simple as putting the handheld in sleep and then waking it back up are also more user-friendly. With Bazzite, the handheld essentially functions the same way a Switch or Switch 2 does, letting you press the power button to instantly suspend or resume whatever’s going on. With Windows, however, there’s a lengthier process that includes having to wait for it to load and go through password screens.</p>

 <p>The good news is that Bazzite can be dual-booted with Windows, letting an Xbox Ally X owner swap back and forth as needed. For games that are on Game Pass or require Windows, you can go back to the default experience. For those that are supported on Bazzite, you can get the improved benchmarks. While this might seem like a knock against the Xbox Ally X, it’s really a knock against Windows, and suggests there’s still a lot of room for improvement in that department when it comes to handheld gaming.</p> <p>After all, the Xbox Ally X comes with Microsoft Teams and OneDrive pre-installed, even though its whole pitch is being an Xbox-like gaming experience on a PC handheld.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span>has published a new report about the state of Microsoft’s Xbox division, providing some potential insight into the reasoning behind so many baffling decisions the company has made in the past two years. Apparently, Microsoft leadership has been pushing Xbox to reach a much higher profit margin than is typically expected in the video game industry, and the result is a fundamental shake-up in everything the company has been building, leading to raising prices, canceling games, and sweeping layoffs across its many acquired studios.</span></p> <p><span>According to the report, Microsoft set a goal for Xbox of 30 percent “accountability margins,” which is apparently the term the company uses in place of “profit margins.” As </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> lays out, the average profit margin in the industry is anywhere from 17 to 22 percent, with Xbox having averaged anywhere between 10 to 20 percent over the past six years. So a 30 percent goal is not only far above what the industry typically delivers, it’s well above what Xbox has been bringing in as of late. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>‘s sources, this new number was implemented in the fall of 2023 by Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood. While not every project is expected to hit the 30 percent goal, several developers under Xbox’s umbrella have been given a different target goal than they had previously, with cheaper projects or ones that are expected to generate substantial revenue taking priority over riskier ones.</span></p>

 <p><span>So if you’ve been wondering why everything in Xbox seems to be in disarray, here’s probably a pretty significant reason. Xbox has been reporting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profit-revenue-5-billion-1851787391"><span>billions of dollars in revenue</span></a><span> for services like Game Pass, while simultaneously </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492"><span>laying off thousands of employees</span></a><span>, canceling projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531?rev=1751476543549&amp;_gl=1*1w25uuv*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE0NzM0NDMkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTE0NzY3MjEkajYwJGwwJGgw"><i><span>Perfect Dark </span></i><span>reboot</span></a><span>, and raising the prices for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>consoles</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-dev-kit-price-chinese-tariffs-microsoft-2000637701"><span>dev kits</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604"><span>Game Pass subscriptions</span></a><span>. On top of this, the company has also been releasing its own first-party games </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-indiana-jones-great-circle-release-date-port-dlc-trailer-2000618513"><span>on competing platforms</span></a><span>, seemingly in an effort to get more bang for its buck on projects it was already funding. Many of these price changes had been attributed to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>the Trump administration’s tariffs</span></a><span>, but this report makes it sound like they’re also part of a push from Microsoft for a much higher profit margin than is the industry standard.</span></p> <p><span>While the Xbox division has been very publicly floundering over the past two years, the company is already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181"><span>teasing the next console</span></a><span>, with president Sarah Bond saying it will be a “very premium, very high-end curated experience.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is bringing a brand-new main set, courtesy of Mega Rising. After some brief respite with Deluxe Pack ex, this is a fully fledged set, and it arrives at the end of October 2025.</p>



<p>We enjoyed the much-needed break Deluxe Pack ex gave us. It was a big expansion of recycled and effectively reprinted cards. This is fine, and it means we’ve been able to build up our Pack Hourglasses, and now they are ready to be splashed out frantically on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega</a> Rising.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Three packs to open! Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s face it, thanks to leaks, we already knew a decent amount <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</a>. Still, it’s always cool actually seeing it announced, and you Pocket users might need to start rethinking your best decks.</p>



<p>The likes of Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex, are going to cause havoc.</p>



<p>These special cards are loaded with HP, hard-hitting moves, but come with one massive caveat—a defeated Mega Pokémon is worth 3 points, and gives your opponent the immediate win.</p>



<p>Again, this is going to change up the strategy needed quite a bit. <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>‘s Mega Rising drops on October 30, and as it’s set B1, we’re expecting a LOT of cards to collect!</p>

I don't want to give anything away, because I'm not sure what I’m allowed to say or not, but there are plans for some other kinds of video games that aren't necessarily Xbox or PlayStation," he said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-boys-gen-v-finale-video-game-mexico-spinoff-1236558790/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety.</a></p><p>Characters from The Boys have appeared in games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat, but there hasn't been a dedicated game for the series as of yet.</p><p>Based on the comics, The Boys is a TV series for Prime Video that spawned a spin-off series, Gen V, and a spin-off called The Boys: Mexico is also in the works. There is also the upcoming prequel series, Vought Rising, which takes place in the 1950s.</p><p>The series seems ripe for a video game, as the world is full of powerful characters with unique abilities, and the off-beat and comedic tone might be appealing to many.</p><p>Amazon--which hosts The Boys TV show--is also a big player in the world of video games, but it remains to be seen what company may back any future games based on the show. The show is produced in part by Sony.</p><p>Gen V recently wrapped up its second season, which leads into the fifth and final season of The Boys. A release date has not been announced, but it's expected in 2026.</p>

            <p>The Xbox gaming division is being asked to operate with a 30 percent profit margin, claims a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. This demand for an above industry average margin resulted in many of the decisions that have blighted Xbox in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">job cuts, the cancellation of big game projects</a>, and an increase in prices on hardware and services.</p>
<p>While the Bloomberg report states that not all projects at Xbox are being set this 30 percent profit margin brought in during 2023, sources have told the publication that many developers and groups have this target.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reveals that a profit margin of 30% is usually only found in a company having a tremendously good year, and this figure is way above the average. Since 2018 the highest average profit margin across the industry (according to estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence) peaked at 22.1 percent in 2020 and dropped to 17.1 percent in 2024.</p>
<p>How will this affect the games and hardware from Xbox? Aside from the move to publishing across all platforms (something also being experimented with by PlayStation, but to a much lesser degree) and the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike to Xbox Game Pass</a>, Bloomberg's sources have said that less costly games and games with higher revenue expectations will be prioritised.</p><p>Xbox has faced rumours over its next-gen hardware, but the division's president Sarah Bond has just this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">confirmed new hardware is still coming</a>, and it's going to be "a very premium, very high-end curated experience." This has resulted in many expecting this new Xbox console to be significantly more costly to buy than previous generations.</p>
<p>Xbox provided a statement to Bloomberg:</p>
<p>"We look at the business as a whole, balancing creativity, innovation, and sustainability across a diverse portfolio of offerings. As with any creative business, sometimes that means making hard decisions and stopping work on things that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, and shifting resources toward the projects that are more aligned with our direction and priorities."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>How do you solve a problem like using AI for video games? That’s the question every megacorp is trying to figure out right now, but amongst the countless ways that it really can’t or really shouldn’t be used –&nbsp;like, don’t use AI as an excuse for laying off human employees, please&nbsp;and thank you –&nbsp;there are a few areas that generative large language models can shine. Enter Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p><iframe title="Courtroom Chaos featuring Snoop Dogg: Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjPSCmibeFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the headlining game from Amazon Luna’s relaunch and push towards more casual gaming with GameNight –&nbsp;alongside a bunch of board game and digital game classics adapted to it – and it’s absolutely got the right kind of hook and broader audience potential. Snoop Dogg presides over a video game twist on Judge Judy or Judge John Hodgeman, where players turn up with a plaintiff and a defendant, there’s the ability to call upon expert witnesses, and then a judgement is handed down. Eminently possible on TV or in podcasting with curated cases appearing in each episode and real grievances, but nigh on impossible for traditional game design, and heck, there’s only one Snoop Dogg!</p>


<p>As with all of the titles in the GameNight library, you play Courtroom Chaos with your phone, logging into a web portal using a code in a fashion that will be familiar to anyone who’s ever Jackbox’d. Two players are assigned to be plaintiff and defendant, and asked to give some kind of personal details, speaking them into your phone. Judge Snoop Dogg then jumbles this all up and comes up with a case.</p>
<p>In our test case, it was two of the players being game developers, with the defendant accused of having inserted some rogue character creation tools that were harming development. You’re all assigned into teams from this, with the other players able to choose what kind of witness they are –&nbsp;eyewitness, expert witness, for example. You’re called in turn to give testimony, trying to play to win AI Snoop Dogg’s favour and convince him to side with you. You can strategise with your argument, maybe lean in on statistics and plausible fabrications as you play into your assigned role, and it was always quite funny to see how AI Snoop would react, the build up as the server chewed through our long and rambling arguments adding to the suspense.</p>


<p>Let’s say he’s maybe not as consistent as you’d want from an actual judge. One moment, he didn’t like my statistics, but then he loved my testimony in the final judgment, and that kind of shows the still capricious nature of LLMs in general, which Amazon will look to be tuning and training as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s an enjoyable game, though, and I can absolutely see people having a laugh while messing around with it, in the same way that people toy with generative AI tools more generally. It helps, of course, that it will be bundled in with the Amazon Prime memberships, accessible wherever you get Amazon’s streaming platform, and that’s all key to Amazon Luna’s new pitch.</p>
<p>This game, and a whole bunch of others, are just there and waiting for you to stream and play, if you’re a Prime subscriber. In contrast to Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, the relaunch of Amazon Luna will only have a limited selection of big budget AAA controller-based games. There’s still big hitters like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Hogwarts Legacy, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, but GamesNight is the dedicated section for games you can just play with your phone.</p>
<p>On day one there’s 29 GameNight titles, including a bunch of Jackbox standalone classics, as well as some specially adapted games like Tetris Effect: Connected and Garfield Kart 2, and board games like Cluedo. Courtroom Chaos isn’t Amazon’s only original effort, though.</p>

<p>Flappy Golf Party is…. well, it’s Flappy Bird meets minigolf. All the players have a bird-like golfball and there’s an enclosed stage to race through, flapping to the right or to the left, gliding, and trying to get to the hole first. It’s simple, fun and easily accessible, and honestly I wanted to play more than just the few holes we got to try!</p>
<p>The same can be said of Draw &amp; Guess, which is a drawing riff on a game of telephone. You’ll constantly cycle between drawing from a prompt on your phone, and then guessing what the prompt someone else was given from their drawing. That guess is then passed along, and around we go several times before we see the results and vote. I just wish there was a little more panache to this game’s presentation, taking a few leafs out of Jackbox’s book to have multiple rounds, some quirky scoring, a break in the middle before mixing up themes. As it is, it feels a little too simplistic… but that certainly helps it be very immediate and easy to play.</p>

<p>Courtroom Chaos is clearly what Amazon want to hang their hat on. It’s got the production values, the big name star, the inventive use of AI chat to power it, and it shows the potential of playing games in the cloud. How Amazon follows that up for GameNight will be fascinating to see. They’ve promised that new games will be added regularly, and this library could easily become a go-to avenue for a family gaming session where you don’t have to worry too much about irregular gamers feeling excluded by learning gamepad buttons.</p>

						<h5>The Outer Worlds 2</h5><p><span>October 29, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Xbox Game Studios</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Obsidian Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 arrives six years after Obsidian Entertainment launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">The Outer Worlds on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One</a>. At the time, I was excited to play it and to see what the studio was building in this space-faring adventure. I picked up my copy right at launch, and thought, like many others, that it got off to a great start. It was funny, the world felt interesting, and I liked the game's premise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I soured on it long before I would even get close to credits, due to a mix of the gameplay and the story losing me after a short while. But I know, like so many others, that Obsidian is a talented team, and has been for a long time. One game I didn't entirely gel with doesn't mean the rest won't work, which is why I was still optimistic about The Outer Worlds 2, even if it came with a heavy dose of caution.</p>



<p>After spending over 30 hours with The Outer Worlds 2 to hit credits, the first chunk of my time spent mostly playing on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and the second half more on my Xbox Series X, I'm happy to see that Obsidian stepped it up with this sequel.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's a much more refined experience in a lot of ways. The gunplay feels meaningfully better than it did before, and I don't just mean the actual shooting, but also the arsenal of weapons available to you as well. The RPG elements are made more interesting due to the new Flaw mechanic introduced here, which can drastically or only slightly change your gameplay experience, should you accept each Flaw as they come. And the cherry on top of it all is that it is visually stunning, and a much, much, much better-looking game than its predecessor.</p>



<p>All together, The Outer Worlds 2 is undoubtedly a better game than The Outer Worlds, but its issues keep it from being amazing. It's great, don't get me wrong, but a plot that fizzles out before the end, poor pacing, a difficulty curve that felt off the entire time, and a few more rough edges like a pretty abysmal menu system, not to mention a few bugs here and there, all hold it back from the latest and greatest action-adventure RPG to hit the wire.</p>



<p>I want to start with the story, though I will hold back details to avoid spoilers. I found the plot to be a bit more enticing this time around, even if it failed to go anywhere by the time I reached the credits. The basic throughline is you play as an Earth Directorate agent sent to Arcadia to figure out a way to close rifts in space and time that threaten to destroy the universe. It's fairly simple, but the way it kicks off had me far more intrigued compared to how it ended.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Auntie's Choice, The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The shining stars of the story are, unsurprisingly, the characters you meet, and not just the companions that join you on your journey.</p>



<p>Even with the improved gunplay and the larger, dense worlds to explore between the five key planets you'll visit, I had more fun talking to people in my playthrough than I did in combat encounters. The character writing is incredible, from start to finish. Not everyone I talked to felt like they had a rich history and background from which they came and within which they'll continue after I'm done talking to them; some of the conversations just felt like chatting with videogame NPCs. </p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>But even those conversations were fun, and more often than not funny, to be a part of, while some of the characters you meet are truly excellent, and carry that genuine feeling of them being a part of the universe in The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>With the strong character writing and stunning animation work for the close-up view of each conversation, I never had a bad time talking to anyone, and that was a huge element of what kept me so glued to The Outer Worlds 2, not just because I was playing it to write this review. On top of some solid characters you meet in the wild, the companions you recruit across your adventure are the highlights of the game's characters.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aza and Niles in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll recruit up to six companions: Niles, Val, Inez, Marisol, Aza, and Tristan. You can take two of them out with you when you're off adventuring, each of them having different special abilities they can use in combat, and outside of combat, having them in your party can lead to different outcomes for conversation, and more hostile, or a warmer reception from NPCs, depending if the members of your party are in an opposing faction.</p>



<p>I definitely have my favourites, like Aza and Marisol, but that's not to count the others out. Save for Tristan, perhaps, with whom I didn't necessarily gel, but wanted to recruit to fill out the squad. That said, he's great to have in your party for combat encounters.</p>



<p>They're all part of different factions, making your ship a home to a motley crew of characters. Tristan is a member of the Protectorate, a tyrannical faction run by a Sovereign that is never meant to be questioned, and if you do, you'll be sent to 'Mental Refreshment,' which is a fancy way of saying your brain will quite literally be scrambled and made flat to avoid having any 'impure thoughts' such as wanting to think for yourself and make your own choices in life. The Protectorate are, at least for the most part, the antagonist of the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Marisol in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Marisol is a member of the Order of the Ascendant, a faction constantly striving for the betterment of humanity by pouring itself into scientific study and research. It also believes the universe can be explained with math and probability, making decisions based on calculations and predictions that somehow do occur, even if they're not exactly as they were predicted.</p>



<p>Aza is a member of the Glorious Dawn, a cult that believes they will be reborn again in perfection by jumping into these rifts that are appearing everywhere. Jumping into a rift is not something you can do and survive, so their 'rebirth' comes in the afterlife.</p>



<p>Niles and Val are both Earth Directorate agents like yourself. Val is also a robot, so her beliefs come from her Earth Directorate programming. Niles, like any 'good' Earth Directorate agent, takes to heart the mission of the Earth Directorate and wants to clear the universe of evil and corruption, wherever they find a home.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Inez in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, Inez is an Auntie's Choice corporatist who prefers the freedom that Auntie's Choice provides, even if it means a lifetime employment contract and dealing with the non-existence of workers' rights within the Auntie's Choice ultra-capitalist society.</p>



<p>Each of them believes their way of life is the only way of life that should be considered, though their differences don't stop them from working together, and it often made for interesting side conversations heard across the ship, where everyone would mingle, and between the two companions you bring with you outside of the ship. </p>



<p>How each faction and their ways of life play off each other in your adventures, having to mind different temperaments in conversations while playing to whichever faction the NPC you're talking to is with, on top of what are some seriously silly situations you'll get to deal with all made for fun melodrama and quests that were, realistically, repetitive in their gameplay, but my desire to see them through to get even more of the game's narrative and character storytelling didn't make any of them feel like a chore. Except for the few bounty quests that exist on the various planets. Those are shallower, but still good to earn a few Bits (the in-world currency in The Outer Worlds 2).</p>

<p>Speaking of the quests, and the game's pacing and progression, it's lacklustre, to say the least. The quests themselves aren't bad. The companion quests are all a lot of fun to do. It's the amount of XP you earn from completing quests and from other in-game activities in the early hours, and that really throws the pacing off. In my first 10 hours with the game, it felt like it took forever to level up, a problem that's almost immediately a non-issue once you leave the first planet.</p>



<p>As a result, the early hours felt far slower than they probably should have, and I had a difficult time getting a sense of the character I was trying to build in relation to where to deposit my skill points based on what I had encountered that required skills to bypass. Combat encounters were a much greater hassle as well, since I felt grossly underlevelled for most of the fights I faced in those opening hours.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, as if a flip was switched, without changing the difficulty, it felt like I was grossly overpowered in fights, levelling up twice or three times in a single session, and barely breaking a sweat in combat encounters with the weapons I was finding and my improved skill stats. I'm all for a power fantasy, but that fantasy was almost a fully-formed reality when I was barely halfway through the game.</p>



<p>It felt like I had seen everything worth seeing regarding the combat, and there wasn't much else, so I might as well be mowing through enemies I would have tried to avoid just a few game-time hours before. Even with the few difficulty spikes that occur across the rest of the game, after a certain point, combat felt trivial.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>An element of the gameplay I really appreciated throughout the whole game, however, is the improved Flaw system. Throughout your playthrough, at various junctions and in response to how you're playing the game, a message will pause you and appear on screen declaring that the Earth Directorate has found a flaw in you. That Flaw has both negative and positive impacts, and it's entirely up to you if you want to accept or reject the proposed Flaw.</p>



<p>Of course, having flawed characters in RPGs is nothing new, but the execution of the Flaws here felt like fun call-out moments, and like the Obsidian team is in conversation with the player by responding to how you're playing. Stealing a lot of stuff? You'll probably get the Kleptomania flaw pop up, which would automatically steal things, potentially throwing you into tense scenarios when walking through a town, but you'd also be able to sell stolen goods to vendors at a high premium.</p>



<p>Crouching all the time to be sneaky? The Bad Knees Flaw will find its way to you, which makes your knees creak and make noise while you're crouching, but you're also much faster when crouching. Going for a stealth build? Then you'll probably have the Treacherous Flaw suggested to you, which greatly increases sneak attack damage when you can pull one off, but reduces your health and keeps enemies aware of your presence for longer.</p>

</figure>



<p>These are just a few examples, and each one of them can add something to your gameplay experience that will meaningfully change how you play the game. I didn't accept every Flaw; part of what makes it work is that you can just say no and keep playing as normal (though there is a Flaw that makes you accept all Flaws if you don't want the option to refuse).</p>



<p>What should come as no shock, based on where I've already said I had the most fun in this game, I especially loved how the Flaws played into conversations when applicable. 'Consumerism' is one of the funnier Flaws, because it's earned by purchasing the Premium Edition of The Outer Worlds 2. It's a Flaw that makes you sound ridiculously dumb in conversation, to the point where NPCs look at you with deep concern about the fact that you didn't understand the very basic sentence they just said.</p>



<p>Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the visuals and graphical fidelity in The Outer Worlds 2. It looked great playing it on my 4K TV on my Xbox Series X, with bright colours and striking vistas. It also looked half-decent on the ROG Xbox Ally X, which was honestly a shock when I was first playing it, because I didn't expect much. I was even more shocked then when a patch released days before this review went live made the game look leagues better on the newest PC handheld on the market.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2. Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of the ROG Xbox Ally X, a quick note on performance is that prior to the patch, I was able to get the game looking half-decent while staying at a solid 30 FPS at 1080p while playing on both the 17w Performance and 35w Turbo mode, with ray tracing off and the graphical settings on High. After the patch, not only did it look way better, but the framerate improved under the same settings to be a consistent 40 FPS.</p>



<p>More optimization should be coming, if it's not already here by the time this review goes live, so hopefully it'll improve even beyond what I'd already consider to be a solid experience. That's assuming you don't run into any bugs, that is. I did see my fair share, some funny ones like one of my companions constantly flying off a ledge to try and melee enemies that were too far away from our current position to reach, and could only be taken out with ranged weapons. Despite this, melee-combat-focused Tristan rapidly flew himself off a ledge before returning over and over again until the fight finished.</p>

<p>I also had a bug that's still in my game, where Aza has a constant speech bubble over her head as if to indicate you should ask her something, but there was never a new dialogue option whenever I tried talking to her. The worst of my technical issues was the game crashing, but thankfully, that only happened once. Your experience may differ, of course, but nothing I experienced from a technical standpoint made The Outer Worlds 2 unplayable in any way.</p>



<p>However, the menu system and the map in The Outer Worlds 2 frustrated me to no end. Both suck, to put it bluntly. Navigating through the menu to find the weapons and items you want is a chore at best, made worse by the fact that any sorting settings you adjust when in the menu are not saved the next time you open it. The map for regions, particularly Paradise Island, the very first area you'll see, barely helps you navigate your way across these planets. That wouldn't be so bad if I could jump on a hoverbike or anything that would make correcting a wrong turn go faster, but having to hoof it everywhere makes every navigational mistake hurt that much more.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is by no means a perfect game. I have my gripes with it, and it grinds my gears in several ways, but the sum of everything that's good about The Outer Worlds 2 is what makes it a great game. It's what makes it something I don't want to put down, which I won't, since I started a new playthrough right after hitting credits the first time.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has once again knocked it out of the park after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> and the successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access debut of Grounded 2</a>, making 2025 a year to remember for the studio. They created a world I want to keep playing in and a cast of characters I want to keep hanging out with. Rolling credits did nothing to release me from the hook The Outer Worlds 2 has on me. Yes, in so many ways, this is just more of The Outer Worlds, but a sequel doesn't necessarily need to reinvent the wheel, and The Outer Worlds 2 adds enough polish and shine to the wheel Obsidian built six years ago that it's more than worth experiencing again, whether you loved the first game or not.</p>

				<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is an improved, more refined version of The Outer Worlds and is an all-around better game than its predecessor, with a well-executed Flaw system to keep gameplay interesting, improved gunplay, stunning visuals, and excellent character writing, voice acting and animations. It's held back by a lacking plot that fizzles well before the end, progression pacing that's all over the place, and an abysmal menu system, but those elements don't make it a game you should skip, whether you were a fan of the first game or not.</p>

            <p>Ah Valve, you awful, giggling vultures. You terrible purveyors of mischief and misfortune. Weeks go past without you making any significant game-related announcements, and then you suddenly dropkick the entire Counter-Strike cosmetics economy into the sun.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The developers have released what they breezily call a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">"small update"</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> that, essentially, allows players to exchange five cosmetic items for other items that sell for a lot, lot more over the Counter-Strike player marketplace. As such, they have crashed the price of the latter items and, according to tracking app Price Empire, <a href="https://pricempire.com/app/trending?srsltid=AfmBOoo3OvDnG87yfdNDv23ZpJ1hS6jq81nUE6ogNh_gioHSJxewyddT">wiped billions of US dollars</a> off the value of the CS2 skins market.</p>
<p>As passed on by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">Gamesradar</a>, the update in question extends the functionality of the 'Trade Up Contract', which allows players to swap common "Covert" items obtained from purchaseable cases for much rarer knives or gloves, including "StatTrakTM" gear that, as the name implies, tracks certain play statistics when equipped. </p>
<p>The Trade Up contract now lets people exchange five StatTrakTM Covert quality items for "one StatTrakTM Knife from a collection of one of the items provided", or five regular Covert items for "one regular Knife item or one regular Gloves item from a collection of one of the items provided". The result is that Covert skins have shot up in price, while the price of knives and gloves has plummeted. </p><p>The numbers in question are not tiny. They are in fact quite large. One Covert skin collector <a href="https://x.com/smileybeef/status/1981141120051781834">says</a> that their 609 hitherto "worthless red skins" are now worth £3,329,612 on the marketplace. One respondent comments that "my knife just dropped $1,400 in value in the span of 30 minutes". </p>
<p>Reactions to all this on the Counter-Strike <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2/comments/1odo9tw/this_update_has_made_some_collectors_very_rich/">subreddit</a> naturally vary quite a bit, with knife and glove collectors spitting mad, while others comment that this is great for new players who don't have the pocket money for a $400 make-believe dagger. Over at Forbes, Mike Stubbs <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/10/23/valve-just-crashed-the-high-end-counter-strike-skins-market/">speculates</a> that this is actually Valve's way of punishing knife and glove dealers for selling the items on external marketplaces, even at the cost of sabotaging the CS player cosmetics biz (from which Valve takes a cut) in the short term. I'll go ask the developers if they'd like to comment on all this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Everyone needs something from you in </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>. From military leaders to bartenders, oligarchs to battlefield medics, the population of its science fiction world seems stuck in limbo without your character to guide them. The universe is vast, the game suggests, and entirely inert when outside of your view.</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s a sequel to 2019 predecessor </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span>, Obsidian Entertainment’s follow-up doesn’t assume or require any real familiarity with what came before its story begins. It starts off by tossing you into its setting, a far-flung future where a now-spacefaring humanity has spread across multiple planets; introduces you to your character’s role as the Commander, an agent of a blandly heroic space cop organization called the Earth Directorate; and swiftly plops you into a high-stakes covert mission to save a galaxy-spanning colony from looming obliteration.</span></p>

 <p><span>Heir to the tradition of not just </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span>, but also first-person action RPGs like Obsidian’s own </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> presents the Commander as a blank slate for the player to mold to her preference. This extends from physical customization options and a set of loosely sketched character backgrounds—a professor or ex-convict, for instance—to a variety of personal attributes and attending skills. These run the usual gamut of role-playing traits, like how well the Commander can sneak around enemies, hack computers, pick locks, or convince others to adopt their point of view through conversation.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638373"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638373">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Once out in the world of the game, these skills have a large impact on how </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> plays out. The prologue sees you investigating a connection between humanity’s “skip drive” space travel technology and the appearance of roiling, reality-distorting “rifts.” This involves infiltrating a space station, either by crouch-walking through vents, manipulating machinery and avoiding the attention of enemy patrols, or simply shooting through the opposition and sweet-talking guards when the opportunity presents itself. Either way, the mission inevitably descends into violent chaos—big explosions, side characters bloody in the wreckage, some mild intrigue. The plot picks up nearly a decade later, with the Commander waking from suspended animation after drifting through space following the disaster, now finding themselves with a scarred survivor of the failed assignment and a talking robot as companions, and the thin but serviceable motivation of setting out into the galaxy to figure out exactly what went wrong with their mission as the catalyst for the two dozen or so hours that follow.</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this is particularly exciting, despite the pyrotechnics and lingering plot questions of it all. There’s an immediate sense, as you venture onto the surface of the first sprawling planet of the many that will be explored throughout </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, that you’ve seen most of what the game has to offer in its prologue alone. In a way, this is true. The set-up is familiar video game sci-fi; warring factions of hardened, real-life-adjacent ideologues and high-concept cosmic mysteries introduced before letting the player loose to poke around a vast world at her leisure.</span></p>

  <p><span>For anyone who’s played the modern </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> games, let alone Obsidian’s own </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> and this year’s </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, the shape of what’s to come is all too apparent from the outset. You will run around sprawling natural and urban landscapes, crafting and collecting items, chatting with strangers to take on quests, finding companions to accompany you on your journey, and massacring countless enemies along the way. There are experience points to gain, characters milling around towns with a few lines of dialog to hear, and an overarching plot to progress that often feels beside the point during hours of idle exploration.</span></p>

 <p><span>The texture of this familiar terrain can go a long way toward making a game work or not. Fortunately, the act of moving and murdering through the game’s world is enjoyable enough to distract from its larger failings for a while. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> is focused on sprinting (and, once a specific item is acquired, double jumping) across a series of planets; gunning down enemies that include human soldiers, whirring drones, hulking battle robots, and an assortment of alien animals; and reading notes while picking through the drawers, corpses, and countertops of enemy bases. The fighting is best at range, with a large arsenal of guns to pick from that span the typical video game line-up of pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, and rifles through to more bizarre variations that might, in one case, throw bolts of lightning or, in another, globs of putrid green goop. The smack of bullets against enemies and the bursts of numbers that come flying from them as their health bar depletes is brain-tickling enough to make doing so over and over again less of a chore than it might otherwise be.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all helped along by the fact that </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> has a strong, if too familiar, look. Each planet contains vistas resembling the covers of pulp sci-fi paperbacks. Whether a forested planet, where the broad red leaves of trees contrast with green mountains and purple flowers, or a broken-down art deco train station overlooking rocky canyons, with spears of rocky mineral deposits jutting from its ground, the vibrant, sometimes garish colors of the game’s environments are a consistent highlight. This extends through to the setting’s architecture, too. The military and research installations that dot each of the planets feature rounded plastic exteriors and chunky, postwar computer terminals, with wooden crank handles attached to their sides as controls. The retrofuturist look of glowing hologram advertisements and 20</span><span>th</span><span> century propaganda posters may be as kitsch as the game’s soundtrack—a selection of mid-century jazz that would fit as easily in a </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game as it does here—but it all works to enliven the otherwise dull proceedings.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638375"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638375">©Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, a set of ideologically rigid factions vie for control of the setting. These include the ruling Protectorate, a pseudo-communist authoritarian monarchy with a penchant for high technology, as well as Auntie’s Choice, a hyper-capitalist corporation created from a merger of the first game’s Auntie Cleo and Spacer’s Choice companies. There are also the Commander’s Earth Directorate, and a cultish force of utopian math-worshipping scientists called The Order of the Ascendant. Most of the game’s major choices involve sympathizing with or opposing these factions, helping them achieve their goals, thwarting them, or finding compromises that keep everyone as happy as possible—even working together in uneasy alliance during some sequences. At its best, the thorny conversational decisions featured in this style of design can resemble a series of philosophical puzzles that make the player consider their own outlook on life through difficult moral dilemmas. Here, though, the major factions are presented with such cartoonish simplicity that it’s hard to feel much of anything for them.</span></p> <p><span>The Protectorate are depicted as hapless and brainwashed, their love of robots and unthinking devotion to their leadership stifling their ability to think creatively about how to achieve the egalitarian society they desire. The capitalists, on the other hand, are so in love with buying and selling that they willfully turn a blind eye to the human suffering that their devotion to unregulated commerce entails. Every faction is totally devoted to their ideology, typically unable to recognize blind spots in their thinking until the Commander, with a high enough Speech skill, shows them the gaps in their outlook.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is colored with a satiric tone that papers over the thin characterization of these factions and their members. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>’s limp sense of humor prevents its story from becoming oppressively grim, but it also keeps its portrayals of corporate servitude and the terror of authoritarian rule at arm’s length, maintaining a hedged distance from its subject matter that replaces emotional honesty—and dramatic heft—with an ironic wink at nearly every turn. (A Tweedledee, Tweedledum pair of Auntie’s Choice executives, for instance, raise the issue of a worker’s strike at one of their factories with outsized disbelief at the concept of their laborers’ ingratitude for their crushing jobs.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638374"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638374">©Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This approach makes the line-up of companion characters who join up with the Commander throughout the story a bland bunch, too. Each of them is presented as a mascot for their faction, whether that be an Auntie’s Choice soldier who’s been the subject of macabre scientific experiments, a Protectorate fanatic struggling with his role as a violent agent of the state, or a cultist with a serial-killer-like thirst for blood. Each of these characters’ story arcs supplement your understanding of their respective factions through a personalized representation of that faction’s ideology. But these plotlines are largely flat, terminating with abrupt moments of “growth” in which the companion realizes the need to broaden their viewpoint. Worse are those that hinge on convincing companions to spare a character they’re set on killing, usually in an act of revenge, which is hard to care much about when the worth of one life is measured against the dozens of unnamed enemies that have been murdered en route to the scene in question.</span></p>

 <p><span>While common to video games, this blinkered sort of moral questioning is hardly convincing—and it points toward </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>’s generally compromised approach to interactive drama. There is, basically, no sense of conviction to any topic the game addresses. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> motions broadly at the concerns of our actual world, through abstracted versions of real history and modern society, and condemns what it finds there through aloof jokes about the wilful blindness to human misery that authoritarian rule and a consumerist culture require.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Shoot for the moon.

A deep-pocketed patron might be necessary to fund games as lavishly constructed as </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>. The fact that its money comes from a real-world corporation</span> <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox"><span>currently facilitating genocide</span></a><span> has a way of dulling the bite of its intended anti-corporate satire, though. This is a problem inherent to big-budget art and entertainment, where money often comes from corporations whose actions may—and, in this case, do—damage the intent of the work made in association with them. But the result is impossible to ignore.</span></p> <p><span>Together with the indifferent, overly simplistic portrayal of its subject matter, the context of the game’s production means that the many choices you’re asked to make throughout </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> ring hollow. By the time the credits roll, preceded by a slideshow of images showing how your Commander’s decisions impacted the future of the game’s world, there’s a deflating sense that none of the time spent inhabiting its setting has mattered. Its characters might have changed their point of view, and the outcome of the final battle might have played out slightly differently based on your choices, but the cast is so artificial that it’s easy to imagine them all quietly shuffling back to their original marks, ready to start the whole story over again from the beginning when another player boots up the game. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> promises flexibility in storytelling, but when that flexibility comes from interacting with one-dimensional characters who inhabit such an unconvincing world, there isn’t much of a point to it.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368]]></content:encoded>
