            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that Neowiz, the parent company of Round 8 Studio, the team behind<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> Lies of P </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture</a>, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/">working on a sequel to its Bloodborne-like hit</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/">has sold over 3 million copies since its launch</a>. But a Lies of P sequel isn't the only project that Neowiz has on the go. In fact, it's not even the only Souls-like game Neowiz has in development.</p>



<p>Per the studio's <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">latest investor presentation</a>, it has a total of five projects set to release on PC and consoles in development at its in-house studios. If you add its mobile games, it has seven total projects on the go from its internal teams.</p>



<p>Of those five projects, one of them is the sequel to Lies of P. Another is a new Souls-like project led by Kay Lee at Neowiz. Another is a new narrative-focused RPG led by Seungho Jin, and rounding out the remaining two is a new life simulator game, and a new survival action title.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Neowiz</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The company definitely has a lot on its plate, but after Lies of P, it's difficult not to be completely excited for whatever the studio is cooking up. With Lies of P, the studio proved it could enter a highly competitive and, for many players, oversaturated genre and still find ways to improve and innovate on what came before, even if it didn't hit its mark perfectly.</p>



<p>So, hearing that it'll be trying to do that again with both a sequel to Lies of P and an entirely new Souls-like, and it'll be entering the survival-action game genre, and a new life simulation game, sparks further excitement around how the studio could potentially innovate in those genres. At least, that's the hope.</p>

Using a standalone VR headset can feel more freeing when playing games than being connected to a PC with a cable, but it’ll still weigh heavily on your head, so you may feel some strain after wearing it for a little while. However, its sale price and included extras make it an especially great choice if you’ve never tried a VR headset before, or are shopping for a gift for a gamer.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820921/meta-quest-3s-black-friday-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/act-fast-to-save-a-massive-26-on-this-2024-microsoft-surface-pro-on-amazon-today-2000644008</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-joins-black-friday-with-the-2-in-1-surface-pro-2024-hundreds-off-its-lowest-price-ever.1353763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are already coming in hot. This is a great time to grab both the essentials and big-ticket items you have been keeping an eye on, without paying the full price. Those looking for a powerful tablet that can turn into a full-fledged Windows laptop when needed should consider the Microsoft Surface Pro, especially now that it’s going for a lot less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/">The 2024 model of this machine typically retails for $2,100, but you can now snag it for $1,550 after a nice 26% discount.</a> This discount applies to the Platinum model and is available to both Prime and non-Prime members. It’s also one of the steepest price drops we have seen on this model, but we’re not expecting it to last long. It’s best to grab yours before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen, Plus All-Day Battery Life</h2>
<p>It’s slightly bigger than most tablets out there. You’re getting a 13-inch OLED touchscreen display that delivers brilliant visuals with exceptional color accuracy in both bright and dim settings. Your favorite shows will come to life, and even gaming will feel immersive. Touchscreen makes it easy to navigate; you can swipe, scroll, pinch, sketch, and even type with ease.</p>
<p>The tablet also comes with a built-in stand at the back, which makes it easy to prop the screen up however you like. Working on the go? Stand it upright. Going through a long, boring document? Use it as a notebook. Feeling a bit creative? Lay it flat on the table to paint or sketch. You can also add the Surface Pro Flex keyboard (which is sold separately) to your setup and turn it into a laptop when needed.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a Snapdragon X Elite processor with 12 cores. It’s powerful enough to handle all your heavy-duty tasks like content creation, video production, multitasking, and more. The 32GB RAM makes sure you don’t experience any frustrating slowdowns as you work, while the massive 1TB SSD offers plenty of space to store all your photos, videos, and files with ease.</p>
<p>Copilot+ integration makes your everyday tasks a breeze. You can use it to ask questions, get help with studies, generate art using a simple prompt, and even enjoy better video calls with improved lighting and real-time subtitles. This 2-in-1 tablet also won’t give up on you in the middle of a busy day, as the battery life is designed to last up to 14 hours on a single charge.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-hacker-cheater-earthquake-ban-2000644326</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-has-a-cheating-problem-and-players-are-helpless-to-stop-it.1353760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is so focused on its single-player story that you might have forgotten the RPG has a competitive mode like most other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. This four-player versus mode pits you and the other trainers against one another in a race to see who can defeat the most monsters in a short amount of time. Even if you’re not a competitive person, you might still be playing this mode to try and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>unlock some of the Mega Stones gated behind it</span></a><span>. So you want it to be fair, right? Well, it sounds like the mode is being overrun by hackers who are cheating their way to victory.</span></p>   <p><span>I don’t play much of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer myself, so the first time I was clued into the hacking epidemic was through a video on TikTok that showed a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Garchomp</span></a><span> repeatedly using its powerful ground-type attack Earthquake without any cooldowns. Because there was no gap in between these devastating area-of-effect moves, its trainer racked up points on the scoreboard so quickly that there was no way anyone else could catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What I didn’t realize at the time was that this has become so widespread that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>creators are weighing in and providing their own footage of rigged online matches. Some of the possible hacks might not be that recognizable to the untrained eye. AustinJohnPlays has an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAqhVep_5dc"><span>extensive video</span></a><span> on several hacked Pokémon he and others have encountered online, though not all of the exploits are as damning as a Garchomp with no cooldowns.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For example, he shows a Lucario who seems to have been captured with a Poké Ball that isn’t available in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. This doesn’t give anyone a competitive advantage but it’s an example of how some people are clearly modding the game in various ways. Some are advantageous in competitive play, like someone having an </span><a href="https://x.com/amiosi/status/1986910946556535092?s=20"><span>Alpha Xerneas</span></a><span>, a larger, more powerful form of a Legendary Pokémon that is only obtainable once in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and not as an Alpha. Clearly, some players are up to hacked shenanigans and taking these unobtainable Pokémon online.</span></p>

  <p><span>Some of the hacks AustinJohnPlays highlights might seem harmless, such as some players changing their in-game trainer ID card images to real photos, but when you see there’s an astronomical gap between their online scores and those of regular players, it’s probably safe to assume they’re also messing with the stats, movesets, and properties of their Pokémon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t have any kind of reporting or blocking feature, so these hackers are running around in competitive battles, spamming moves and using Pokémon they shouldn’t be able to access. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

In the game's epilogue, set six months later, Karlach mentions a recent adventure where she obtained a set of blueprints offering a possible solution for her infernal engine.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mario Kart DS is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 14, 2025. Below, we examine how the fan community has kept the game alive, and online, long after official servers were retired.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Mario Kart DS launched in 2005, it felt like a glimpse into the future. For the first time, Nintendo’s chaotic, shell-filled racer could be played online, pitting players from around the world against each other in real-time competition. It was a leap few handheld games had dared to make at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades later, the official Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers that powered those matchups are long gone, but the race never really stopped. Through fan-built tools, open-source servers, and emulation projects, Mario Kart DS remains alive and well--still spinning its wheels in the hands of a dedicated community that refuses to let it drift into the past.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Nintendo DS debuted, it was marketed as a “third pillar” for the company--a strange, dual-screen experiment meant to sit alongside the GameCube and Game Boy Advance. But with Mario Kart DS, the touch screen rarely came into play. The game focused the series’ easy-to-pick-up gameplay with a forward-thinking approach that accelerated Mario Kart into the future. GameSpot, in fact, loved the game in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mario Kart DS is without a doubt one of the best games to hit the Nintendo DS to date," GameSpot's reviewer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-ds-review/1900-6139765/">wrote</a>. "The game plays every bit as well as any of its predecessors, and adds just enough new features to the mix to make it worthy of your attention, even if you're still playing any of those games on a regular basis. The online play is undoubtedly the icing on an especially yummy cake, and even if you're not in a position to sample said icing, a yummy cake without icing is still a yummy cake."</p><p dir="ltr">Using Nintendo’s Wi-Fi Connection service, players could race online via local hotspots or home internet connections. It wasn’t perfect--online matchmaking was limited to a handful of tracks, and finding friends required clunky friend codes--but it was enough to ignite a new kind of competition. Suddenly, players could test their drifting skills against strangers halfway across the globe. For many, it was their first taste of online console gaming at all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC4Ohj0jdBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pC4Ohj0jdBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Beyond its online capabilities, Mario Kart DS also raised the bar for what handheld racing could be. It introduced retro cups, reimagining classic tracks from previous entries. It popularized snaking, a technique where skilled players could chain boosts by quickly alternating drifts, giving the game a competitive depth.</p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo shut down its Wi-Fi Connection servers in 2014, it seemed like the end of an era. Online play for Mario Kart DS--and dozens of other Nintendo titles--was suddenly gone. But like any good racer, fans found a way to take a shortcut.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just found a way to play Mario Kart DS online again. It's really cool that you can still do this,' one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartDS/comments/1cfjera/playing_mario_kart_ds_online_in_2024/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2024. "It's not as active as the Wii, but it's actually pretty easy to find a match."</p><p dir="ltr">Through reverse engineering and open-source initiatives like Wiimmfi and AltWFC, the game’s online features were kept alive by the community. Players could still race together. The process wasn’t always simple--it required custom patches or modified DNS settings--but it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, fan communities continue to organize races and tournaments. Whenever players went online to post that they found a new way to play Mario kart DS online, but that they couldn't find other players, other Mario Kart DS fans pointed them towards a thriving <a href="https://discord.gg/mario-kart-ds-network-569870981213061120" rel="nofollow ">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of community and legacy is what drives many of these projects. In an era where online games can disappear with the flip of a server switch, Mario Kart DS has become a case study in fan-powered preservation. It’s proof that players can keep a game alive long after its corporate support ends--through passion, a little technical skill, and sheer determination.</p><p dir="ltr">Even by today’s standards, Mario Kart DS feels remarkably tight. Its track design, item balance, and snappy controls strike a near-perfect blend of skill and chaos. The game’s focus on pure mechanics--no anti-gravity, bikes, motion controls, or touch-screen gameplay--makes it a favorite for players who crave the series’ classic feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Its simplicity is part of its staying power. Modern entries like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World are spectacular in scope, but DS captures a more stripped-down energy--a focus on short bursts of fun that perfectly fit the handheld format. Races are quick, items are well-tuned, and the roster, while smaller with 12 standard racers including most of Mario's immediate family, friends, and rivals, is iconic.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s also a game that rewards mastery. Snaking and mini-turbo management turned what looked like a casual party racer into a surprisingly deep competitive title. The best players could maintain near-constant boosts, flying through tracks with dizzying speed. Nintendo eventually toned this down in later games, but among longtime fans, Mario Kart DS remains the “technical” entry--the one that truly separated the pros from the pack.</p><p dir="ltr">As Mario Kart DS turns 20, its community, while small, is firmly in cruise control. Players continue to introduce newcomers to its underground online scene. For many, keeping the game alive isn’t just nostalgia--it’s a statement about access in the digital age.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Mario Kart will likely continue to evolve, beyond the sandbox experiment of Mario Kart World and the fun augmented reality of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. But in many ways, Mario Kart DS set the standard. It proved that online play could work on a handheld and that great design never goes out of style.</p><p dir="ltr">Twenty years on, the finish line isn't even on the track. The race, at least for now, feels endless. The drivers are still out hugging turns on Delfino Square and dodging obstacles on Waluigi Pinball with their feet firmly planted on the gas pedal.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image Credit: XCageGame on YouTube</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Starting with Horizon Zero Dawn and followed up with Horizon Forbidden West, the PlayStation franchise has seen players following protagonist Aloy on a single-player adventure. With the recent reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, the focus changes from a solo affair to an MMO. But Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek has stated the series started with multiplayer in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-for-buildin-jest/1900-6418316/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> was apparently Guerilla dipping its toes in the water with multiplayer, according to van Beek <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>. But going forward, the studio will focus more on this social aspect. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," wrote van Beek. "Lego Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we're excited to show you what is coming."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. <br>LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one.

The MMO looks a bit inspired by the Monster Hunter series and will feature large-scale raids. Meanwhile, Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, arguing the game is a "slavish clone" of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">As van Beek implies, multiplayer looks here to stay with the Horizon franchise. In fact, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/">reported that a multiplayer Horizon game is the next project from Guerrilla</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a live-action Horizon movie in the works</a>, though no directors, writers, or cast members have been announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>For those who have been waiting for a new installment in the Metroid Prime series since August 28, 2007, somehow, now that we're 20 days away (at the time of this writing) from the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the waiting feels even more excruciating. At least in the lead-up to December 4, 2025, Nintendo is putting out new trailers to help tide players over in the last stretch of this long, almost two-decade wait.</p>



<p>The latest overview trailer is a significant look at gameplay, as it goes through several of the game's key systems, showcasing the main game mechanics players will interact with and utilize over the course of Samus' latest adventure.</p>



<p>It also features a solid look at the Galactic Federation soldiers who put out the distress call that Samus responds to at the start of the game, the same call that brings her to the planet Viewros. It seems like these allies will be with her for most of the game, which is definitely a shift from the classic Metroid style of Samus being the lone warrior adventuring out on her own.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Last week, at the one-month mark ahead of the game's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-trailer-ups-the-ante-month-from-release/">a new action-packed trailer </a>showed off some stunning cinematic shots of the game. Now that Nintendo put out another trailer a week later, it feels like that might have been the start of a month-long marketing campaign that'll lead into the game's launch. If that's the case, it'll be great to regularly see more of the game as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Back in April, shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech got to preview the upcoming long-awaited release, with our Nathan Birch writing</a>, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Nathan's feeling that there's a game worth the wait on the way remains true when it arrives on December 4, 2025, on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov is Offline for 24 Hours to Deploy 1.0]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-offline-24-hours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-offline-for-24-hours-to-deploy-1-0.1353706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has just been pulled offline by Battlestate Games for a whopping 24 hours, and potentially longer if the 1.0 rollout needs to be extended. This is to allow the teams at Battlestate to deploy the complete overhaul coming with the 1.0 version of the game, which is the culmination of more than 10 years of development.</p>



<p>Tarkov going offline is a significant moment for the game, as when it comes back up, nothing will ever be the same again…</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-back-online">When is Tarkov Back Online?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be back online when the 1.0 update has been deployed. Battlestate Games has stressed it will be 24 hours from 11:00 GMT, which means 11:00 GMT <strong>tomorrow</strong>, it should be ready to go. When you boot tomorrow, you’ll be loading a new version of Escape from Tarkov, and for the first time in eight years, it <strong>won’t be a beta</strong>.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version comes with a new map, weapons, and equipment, and much more besides. The game will wipe and introduce a new campaign that players can follow to ultimately <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, securing one of four endings to wrap up the game’s core loop.</p>



<p>PvE players will need to wipe their game (but it’s not mandatory) if they want to complete Escape from Tarkov’s new story.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-error-262-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is Error: 262 in Escape from Tarkov?</h3>



<p>Don’t worry, this is just the error message Battlestate Games has applied to the Escape from Tarkov launcher while the 1.0 deployment is being rolled out.</p>



<p>This weekend, a Twitch Drops campaign will go live, with thousands of streamers coming forth to broadcast the 1.0 version for the first time. Typically, a Tarkov wipe heralds a monumental time for the game, and it skyrockets on platforms like Twitch. This will be no different, as this is the most significant event in the game’s storied history.</p>







<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov is likely back and (we hope) better than ever. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re most excited about from the 1.0 Tarkov update.</p>

            <p>On the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers yesterday, there was one big question on everyone's lips. Why is it not coming to PlayStation?</p>
<p>After all, Horizon is one of Sony's most prolific first party franchises, with over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">30m copies sold across PC and PlayStation consoles</a>. But, despite this, the upcoming Horizon MMO from NCSoft is currently only slated for PC and mobile. What gives?</p>

<p>In the time since Horizon Steel Frontiers' announcement, executive producer Lee Song has shed a bit more light on why NCSoft's game isn't coming to PlayStation, suggesting excluding the platform was not NCSoft's decision.</p>
<p>The Horizon Steel Frontiers developer told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">4Gamer</a> that a lack of PS5 release was the "most comment reaction" following the announcement (via machine translation). He added that NCSoft has "no reason" not to bring its game to a PlayStation console.</p>
<p>"We would like to do it," the developer continued, "but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions."</p>
<p>It's been speculated, therefore, it may be Sony's decision not to release the game on PlayStation. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>
<p>In related news, earlier today Guerrilla's studio head celebrated Steel Frontiers' announcement with the revelation that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-horizon-series-was-always-thought-about-as-a-multiplayer-game-says-studio-head-following-mmo-announcement">team had always imagined Horizon as a multiplayer game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I recently got to go hands-on with the Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and not just to play that opening section that everyone and their mum has played at this point. No, I got to play over an hour of one of the game’s earlier parts proper, once Samus has appropriately lost all her abilities because the plot demands it.</p>
<p>I can’t say I was sceptical of the whole psychic angle for the new abilities, but I wasn’t <em>completely</em> sold, either. More fool me, as Metroid Prime 4 leans into the psychic schtick more than I expected, and does so in a way that blends nicely into the gameplay you expect, but is also refreshingly different to classic Metroid Prime fare.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not breaking any major boundaries or anything, but it is <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>For example, there are these little glowy orbs called Psychic Motes that you need to use your special psychic glove to attract and throw into appropriate receptacles in order to open certain doors. You do this using the scan visor (trust me), which is now also the psychic visor (told you to trust me).</p>

<p>You can also use your powers to move certain objects from a distance in a manner that somewhat resembles the motion control nonsense from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, but far less invasive and rhythm-breaking. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>Not only did I manage to unlock all of this within about 40 minutes, but also another ability that allowed me to fire a charged shot which could then be controlled as it flew, slowing down time in the process to make it even marginally controllable. Honestly, it was a tiny bit too slow for my tastes, but I understand that not everyone is as great as I am.</p>
<p>And if you’ve even glanced at any of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4s-sweet-new-trailer-builds-the-hype-for-next-months-launch">the trailers</a> that have been released, you’ll already know that the game is absolutely stunning. The lighting engine doesn’t always hit the mark (as shown in the trailers within a desert area, which was sadly not a part of this preview), but when it does, it <em>really does</em>. The audio design is also stellar, especially the soundtrack. That mysterious, lonely vibe that is quintessential to the Prime series is here in full force, and I am unbelievably grateful for that.</p>
<p>What I’m not grateful for, however, is something that happened just under halfway through my playtime; Samus saves a marine from the snarling wildlife, and he decides to follow her like a worthless little worm, and brings his sub-Marvel humour along with him.</p>

<p>Mackenzie (presumably named after the least socially adept member of <strong>The Inbetweeners</strong>) is fully voice-acted, and reminds you of this fact <em>constantly</em>. I don’t want to blow things out of proportion, but he really did tarnish my time with the game, as not only does he keep yammering away with such classic lines as "Watch out, if you go that way I won’t be able to protect you," but I was also forced to protect him numerous times as I escorted him to a room he mercifully felt comfortable to stay in.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Samus barely engages with him. It would’ve been heartbreaking to hear one of my favourite video game characters break her stoic silence for this clown, so to have the maximum response she gives be a simple nod (even if said nod resulted in him hanging around even more) was a blessed relief. She didn’t even once say "the baby".</p>
<p>My hope is that Mackenzie is saved and sent home nice and early and never spoken of again, or better yet, suffers a painful, embarrassing death offscreen. But we’re going to have to wait until we can play the full release to know for sure. I tried shooting him with a missile, but it didn’t do anything.</p>

<p>If anyone thinks I’m being a little unfair, one of the biggest and most important parts of the Prime series (and the Metroid series as a whole) is the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and that you’re being forced to fight against the environment that doesn’t want you there to begin with. That notion is entirely destroyed once you introduce a character that blathers away at you incessantly, and it'll be a crying shame if this is something that is present throughout the full game’s runtime.</p>
<p>That being said, the rest of my time with the game was excellent, so I’m hopeful that it’ll all be enough to still make Metroid Prime 4 an absolute delight. I’m crossing two of my fingers, and you should too.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>With just a few weeks to go until release, Nintendo has shared a new 7-minute overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer gives us our best look yet at what we can expect from Samus' hotly anticipated adventure. There's a detailed rundown of the planet Viewros, a summary of Samus' sweet new abilities (as well as some returning favourites), and quick look at some of Galactic Trooper friendly faces that you'll have to save along the way.</p>

<p>The trailer dropped early on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, but we've now added it in its full YouTube glory at the top of this post — enjoy!</p>

		<p>Darling, listen up because I’m only saying this once,&nbsp; from today until December 14th, Balenciaga has swanned into PUBG Mobile and turned the whole battlefield into a catwalk for people who like their couture with a side of carnage.</p>
<p>It’s all terribly <em>now,</em> sweetie.</p>


<p>Exclusive items, special rewards, a whole World of Wonder map smothered in Balenciaga. It’s like Paris Fashion Week got drunk and wandered into a warzone.</p>
<p>Models… I mean, players, can unlock all these divine little Balenciaga numbers, the sort of pieces that whisper “high fashion” and scream “don’t touch me, I’m expensive.” There’s the Couture Armor look, inspired by that delicious 3D-printed armour couture moment from Balenciaga’s 52nd show. Very sculptural. Very futuristic. Very “I’m going to obliterate you but make it fashion.”</p>
<p>Then there are all the Winter ’25 bits — the corseted hoodie, the pink puffer, the standard look, it is Balenciaga saying, “Yes, we know you’re in a firefight, but do try to look couture”</p>

<p>And it doesn’t stop there, sweetie. You can also get the Invisible Rectangle Sunglasses (perfect for pretending you haven’t slept in three days), the Faux Fur Helmet (lush), and a Balenciaga Backpack in three upgradeable levels — because even your virtual luggage should be aspirational. Parachutes, avatar frames, graffiti, space gifts, so much to buy!</p>
<p>In World of Wonder, there’s a whole official Balenciaga map, where you can faff about expressing yourself — ghastly concept — but at least there’s a chic snowboard involved.</p>

<p>And of course, because Balenciaga never misses a chance to dress you.. normal.. people, there’s a real-world merch capsule too: T-shirts, caps, keychains, all that “I holiday in Monaco” nonsense. You can pick it up at select Balenciaga stores and online in Australia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the UAE, and the US.</p>
<p>Now, where’s the Bolly?</p>

		<p>The wait for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is almost over, a new first person, 3D adventure for Samus for the first time in 18 years. Heck, it’s been 8 years since this game was announced, and now it’s a cross-gen release for Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>! Having gone hands on with a more extended portion of the game’s opening, has it been worth the wait?</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Final Preview – Psychics &amp; Sidekicks" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GT-zzppAAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game’s opening sees Samus answer a distress call from a Galactic Federation base besieged by the Space Pirates. It’s always felt a little funny to me how sparse the Space Pirate forces were during previous games. You’d be blasting your way into their base, but only really encounter them one or two at a time, giving far less of an impression of a galaxy-spanning threat than they’re made out to be in the series’ expanding lore. Similarly, the Federation come off as utterly helpless and incompetent, outside of knowing when to call Samus for help. Metroid Prime 4’s opening finally gives a proper sense and feeling of how these two might face off, with giant, stompy mechs, Space Pirates dropping into the fray, and a desperate battle to escort a mysterious artefact to safety.</p>


<p>It all goes rather wrong, with a stray shot from Space Pirates leader Sylux hitting the artefact and absorbing everyone into a big glowy explosion of psychic energy – yes, they’ve finally decided to embrace new management after reanimating the skeleton of Ridley for the thirtieth time.</p>
<p>And that’s when things get really quite strange. Finding herself on a totally different planet known as Viewros, Samus is confronted by an alien race, the Lamorn, who have died out but wishes for their legacy to be preserved, and have tasked Samus with doing so by heading to five nearby regions and biomes.</p>


<p>So, Samus has been stripped of many of her abilities, but the artefact has seen fit to grant her with some new ones. Psychic ones! Samus’ visor? That’s psychic now. Her armour? It’s enhanced with a new psychic glove. Her morph ball? It lays psychic bombs. But this does all come to mean something more than just making everything purple – the most psychic of colours, as we all know. When scanning the environment, Samus can now spot things like power nodes and door locking mechanisms, reaching out to manipulate them in various ways as part of the environmental puzzling. Similarly, you quickly gain the ability to fire off a charged shot and then guide it remotely with the world in super slow motion.</p>
<p>Taken alongside the series staples of just shooting everything in sight with various elemental gun types, morph ball bombs, and using enhanced movement, all of this this brings a different tone to the exploration. You might need to convert morph ball bombs into psychic energy motes to charge a mechanism, a door blocked from one side might now be opened with a guided bolt, or just use telekinesis to shift some stuff around. It’s an intriguing new aspect, though I’ll admit there were a few moments where I didn’t quite put two and two together during these puzzles. There are layers of possibilities that now need to be remembered together, I feel, with the psychic abilities relying on switching to the visor view to trigger them. I’m sure this will become more natural through longer play in the full game.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of playing Metroid Prime 4 are slick and smooth, though. The core controls and feel are those of a modern first person shooter, though there’s also some leanings back to the older style of Metroid Prime controls as well. There’s no aiming down sights, but the left trigger will instead lock on that will snap to targets in a satisfying way, so you can just blast away. There is some motion control after touch while doing so, which did take a moment of getting used to, but allows for targeting weak spots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can switch to mouse mode, if you’re playing with Switch 2 and detached Joy-Con 2 in hand. It’s effortless to switch back and forth between console gamepad controls and mouse mode, simply by tipping your hand on its side so the mouse sensor is on a table, sofa arm or trouser leg. This immediately gives you free aim, again making it easier to quickly target weak spots.</p>

<p>That really comes to the fore during boss battles, the first of which sees a Metroid-enhanced Space Pirate monster covering glowing blobs on its body with forearm shields, forcing you to target the exposed area, and then later hitting tentacle weak spots on a giant carnivorous plant. Regular combat encounters have also got bigger than in classic Metroid Prime, with many more enemies and waves of them coming in from multiple angles. It can be quite frantic. Frantic enough, maybe, that Samus could maybe use some help?</p>
<p>This brings us to what I feel will be one of the most controversial additions to Metroid Prime 4. One of the key aspects of this series and the genre it spawned has always been the sense of isolation, while still allowing for degree of human contact for mission briefings and updates. Well, Specialist Myles MacKenzie will seriously undercut that tone.</p>

<p>After saving him from being stranded on a vine-ensnared transport, and then from a horde of Jungle Griever enemies, he joins Samus for the next leg of exploration, and fight alongside with his pistol. That’s fine, but…. Myles is chatty. He will tell you to consult your map, he’ll marvel at Samus’ morph ball, he’ll be all ‘quirky’ during cutscenes in that Marvel movie kind of way. I fear that he will grate in the long run, though it’s not too long before he stays behind at a control panel and lets Samus get some alone time once more.</p>
<p>Sadly our time with Metroid Prime 4 came to an end after exploring this first region, and before getting to hop on the new motorbike to explore the open desert area between regions. That looks like it could be a lot of fun and a real change of pace.</p>
<p>In general, I enjoyed my time with Samus’ latest 3D adventure. It’s long overdue, of course, and there’s a tonal shift from close to two decades difference in game design and script writing. Hopefully that doesn’t skew too heavily away from the classic isolated feel of Metroid, but I’m certainly keen to see how the full game has come together.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Grabbing a powerful, sturdy laptop from a known brand doesn’t have to put a dent in your wallet. We’re spotting plenty of early Black Friday deals dropping in left, right, and center across different retailers. Amazon, specifically, is offering a wide range of high-end laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/">For instance, the 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3535 touchscreen laptop is currently sitting at just $800 at the retailer, which is a massive 64% off its retail price of $2,200.</a> It’s packed with tons of useful features that are sure to support you during busy workdays and even make those late-night entertainment sessions a lot more fun. Alongside the direct discount, you’re also getting several handy accessories thrown in for free, including pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. The offer, however, is only around for a limited time, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Processor to Work, Stream, and Game Easily</h2>
<p>The laptop runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, delivering impressive performance that even outpaces Intel’s i7-1355U in most competing models. Paired with AMD Radeon Graphics, the machine is more than capable of handling everyday work, browsing, streaming, and even light gaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>There’s 32 GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. It makes using demanding applications, as well as multitasking, a breeze. You will be able to work with different programs at the same time, take video calls, create presentations, push some creative boundaries, hop through tabs, and more; without a hint of lag. Best of all, storing everything locally won’t be an issue either. Dell Inspiron 3535 packs a massive 1TB SSD that offers enough space to house a ton of high-resolution photos, videos, programs, and even games without feeling limited. Plus, SSDs ensure fast boot/load times, so you won’t have to wait long to get started.</p>



<p>Display-wise, you’re covered with a modest 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) touchscreen. Its narrow border maximizes the overall space, while the built-in Dell ComfortView technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes. Touch support means you don’t have to limit yourself to the trackpad or the mouse to navigate. When you’re not in the mood to press buttons, simply use your fingers directly on the screen to scroll long documents, swipe through photos, sketch, and even take notes!</p>
<p>Some other features that deserve a mention include the 720p HD webcam, ergonomic lift-hinge keyboard, Wi-Fi 5, and Bluetooth 5.0. All things considered, this laptop is great for work, studies, and even casual use.</p>

                <p>Valve has a new Steam Machine on the way next year, but if you have a long memory, you'll remember that this isn't the first time that the company has attempted to bring PC gaming to the living room. The original line of Steam Machine mini-PCs launched back in 2015, but poor sales eventually saw these devices fade quietly into the background. So what's to stop history from repeating itself? According to Valve, a better video game catalogue and an effort to give developers an easier time when porting games over to the new Steam Machine are some of the key factors that the company has focused on.</p><p>"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux that are originally meant for Windows," engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," fellow engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games, and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games--all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library."</p><p>Griffais explained that developers also wanted to be assured that there would be an audience for their games to justify the effort spent on porting them, and that Valve worked on creating a machine that could reliably run games on it and offer an impressive layer of performance. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-machine-has-overlap-with-traditional-consoles-but-its-not-one/1100-6536196/">In another interview</a>, Griffais mentioned how Valve was aiming to make PC gaming "work better" in the living room, a space traditionally dominated by video game consoles.</p><p>The Steam Machine is currently scheduled to launch in 2026--alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">new Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR headset</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">but pricing for it has not yet been revealed</a>. Valve has said that it wants the Steam Machine to be "affordable," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-is-the-steam-machine-even-for-industry-expert-weighs-in/1100-6536186/">and one industry expert</a> believes that price "sweet spot" could be $400.</p>

Aim-assist is nothing new in Call of Duty (and many other games), but people are saying developer Treyarch went too far with the changes to aim-assist following the beta. Other people say it's great.</p><h2><strong>What Treyarch said about aim-assist changes</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Treyarch said its goal was to "create a more balanced and competitive experience for all players, regardless of input choice." Another important element for Treyarch was to "preserve the core feel of Call of Duty controller gameplay."</p><p>Based on feedback from the beta test, Treyarch said it learned that people playing on controllers have a slight advantage to win shootouts at close range. Keyboard and mouse setups, meanwhile, displayed a statistical advantage at long ranges.</p><p>Treyarch went on to say it also monitored player feedback on rotational aim-assist and made changes for launch based on that. "Based on the data and feedback, our launch adjustments focus on the strength of rotational aim-assist at short and long range, as well as the requirements to fully activate rotational aim-assist," Treyarch said.</p><h2><strong>What players are saying</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 players just getting started with the game have shared their opinions on the aim-assist changes online. Professional player <a href="https://x.com/CoDClipped/status/1988971829537697825" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shotzzy</a> said, "I feel like I have no aim-assist. I'm not even trolling." Others have said it's the <a href="https://x.com/Follow_Henrique/status/1988953891422236768" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"dumbest decision"</a> to change aim-assist in this way. Other people have said <a href="https://x.com/xcellerations/status/1989101650523636131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dialing back aim-assist in this way shows how good you really are at Call of Duty</a>, and that can be humbling. A lot of people are <a href="https://x.com/PhantXmBLXZE/status/1989261492454293781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enjoying and embracing the aim-assist changes</a>. As usual with any given topic on the internet, opinions are all over the place.</p><h2><strong>Could Treyarch change aim-assist?</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 is a live multiplayer game and Treyarch has the ability to make ongoing changes, and that could happen based on feedback. "We look forward to hearing your feedback on these changes, and we will be gathering more data to continue our push for a level and competitive playing field in Black Ops 7," Treyarch said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is out now for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It's also playable via Xbox Game Pass, and you don't have to pay the new, higher rate, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">most major retailers have not adopted Microsoft's 50% Game Pass price hike.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-tips-for-multiplayer/2900-7104/" data-ref-id="2900-7104">tips for multiplayer</a> in the gallery below.</p>

This week the company unveiled a new hardware lineup with a console-like PC at the center, built around SteamOS. The pitch is surprisingly similar to where Microsoft wants to take Xbox—but Steam is the home of the massive PC gaming library, not windows. It's not going to topple Xbox (or any other console) overnight, but a polished multipurpose PC that easily works on your TV raises the question—what's the point of a console anyway?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstart-hit-with-legal-claims-by-iwgb-over-firing-of-unionizing-workers">Rockstar hit with legal claims by IWGB over firing of unionizing workers</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer// </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The fired Rockstar workers aren't going down without a fight.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have come together to unlock the Stella Montis map through a community donation event, which they completed in just one day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">The event</a> required Arc Raiders players to donate a substantial amount of basic resources to an in-universe effort to unblock the North Line. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-first-major-community-unlock-event-has-been-made-harder-mere-hours-after-launch-as-players-were-completing-it-too-fast">It was made increasingly difficult after the community was blasting through it in a matter of hours</a>, though even this change by the developers didn't manage to hold off the Arc Raiders community for long.</p>
<p>As of writing, players are playing their first few games in Stella Montis and discovering all the secrets hidden on this new map. Not so secret are the new Arc enemies, which includes the Matriarch. This giant robot is already chewing through players with an overly aggressive onslaught of varying attacks.</p>

</figure>
<p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the event was finished so quickly, considering how many people have flocked to it over the past few weeks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">The game has shot past four million copies sold</a> according to Nexon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">and continues to surpass its own Steam concurrent user peak as time goes on</a>.</p><p>This substantial update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-secretly-had-duo-queue-for-days-will-be-fully-supported-going-forward">duo queue was suddenly added to the game</a>, following fierce demand from players who weren't happy playing either solo or as a full squad of three. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">Whether or not players will remain friendly in Stella Montis</a>, or will give into their murderous desires as new loot is up for grabs, will be determined this weekend.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not check out Eurogamer's review</a>! In it reviewer Rick Lane summarises the game as such: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

<p>What's that? Huh?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's that, huh? Well, it's a new commercial for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> from Nintendo, and rather than the usual overenthusiastic voiceover to explain basic features, we've instead been treated to a weird, albeit quite wonderful rap song.</p>
<p>Yes, this is one of those ads things that will either go down in history as one of the best things Nintendo has ever put out, or perhaps one of the worst. We'll let you be the judge of that. At the very least, it's bringing back memories of the DK Rap from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, and that can only be a good thing in our book.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, we'd love to see this featured on primetime TV between episodes of Eastenders or Corrie. Just imagine Eastenders ending on the biggest cliffhanger ever and then <em>boom</em>, Kirby rap. Cinema.</p>
<p>It's all good fun, and we'll take it. Kirby Air Riders is launching on Switch 2 on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>, and you can once again get your hands on it this coming weekend with the Global Test Ride. This features Lessons, Air Ride, and City Trial game modes with multiple playable characters and vehicles.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-making-microsd-cards-the-next-game-cartridges.1353616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck changed the way I buy and play games. Just like how the Nintendo Switch blew me away with how it let me play the latest and greatest Nintendo games on the go and on a TV, the Steam Deck has drawn me in with how it offers a vast catalog of PC games that I can play portably or on a big screen. And with the Steam Deck’s microSD card slot, I can add a lot more storage just by tossing in a tiny memory card, meaning I can bring even more games around with me on the device.</p><p>But with its new Steam Machine PC and Steam Frame VR headset, Valve is about to make any microSD cards you use with the Steam Deck even more useful. Like the Steam Deck, both of those devices also run Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, and both have microSD card slots, too. So if the microSD card you’ve plugged into your Steam Deck is formatted for SteamOS, any games you’ve stored on it will be immediately visible by the Steam Machine and Steam Frame as well.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> launch in early 2026, this microSD card support means you’ll be able to take the devices out of the box, slot in your microSD card from your Deck, and start playing most of your games without having to download them again. There might be differences in how well games play across the three devices because of their different specs. But many games will probably work well on all of them, meaning you’ll be able to drop your microSD card into whichever device you want to use and just start playing.</p><p>Basically, your microSD card will almost function like an old-school game cartridge, but instead of it being limited to one piece of hardware or one single game, you can easily bring as many games as can fit on the card to whatever SteamOS PC you’re using at the time.</p><p>However, Valve is only building UHS-I card readers into these devices. UHS-I is <em>slow</em> compared to state-of-the-art microSD or internal SSDs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761845/pc-games-ssd-minimum-specs-starfield-cyberpunk-2077">They may not be able to keep up</a> with every game you want to play, even if most will load fine. Meanwhile, Nintendo has already moved on to supporting the much faster microSD Express format with the Switch 2 (though has arguably also taken a step back by introducing Switch 2 cartridges that are a “key” and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">don’t actually contain games</a>).</p><p>“SD cards are notorious for having low performance, but from our testing and our experience, they actually work really well,” Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <em>The Verge</em> while showing us the Steam Machine at Valve’s headquarters. “For most people, the option makes the most sense, in our opinion.</p><p>When we asked to clarify the spec of the microSD reader, Aldehayyat added, “What we’re trying to emphasize here again is we really want the Steam Machine to be a really easy, super convenient device” that you just plug in, sign into, and start playing games on.</p><p>It’s a key part of what makes Valve’s new hardware feel like part of a cohesive ecosystem, and it could be an important advantage as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">enters the console wars</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The rough beast that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has cracked its shell and slouched towards the wincing light of day. They've released it, I mean. No verdict from us yet: our reviewer is still picking their way among the exploding motorbikes and mocking spectres of deceased Nicaraguan terrorists. But I can at least tell you with some confidence that if you're a fan of pausing games or mid-mission checkpoints, you might want to give it a miss.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">Eurogamer</a>, neither pausing, nor mission checkpoints, nor playing the game offline are allowed in the new Blops, thanks in part to its heavy focus on four player co-op play. You cannot look away from Blops anymore: it has become the Eye of Sauron, transfixing you from across the coffee table as it zooms to flaming close-up. Your time belongs to the cod! It sleeps with the fishes. Damn, I could see a mafia-themed Call of Duty set in Mordor, actually. It doesn't sound like this would be wholly out of synch with the endgame, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-basically-gun-speed-dating-and-its-endgame-is-a-big-fight-in-map-soup">entangles maps from Blopses gone by</a>. Collage Of Duty, they definitely aren't calling it.</p>
<p>This isn't the first Call Of Duty campaign to be always-online. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-missed-that-the-black-ops-6-campaign-is-always-online-but-fortunately-its-not-too-late-to-throw-a-wobbly">Black Ops 6 went there too</a>, and that game sold like hot yellowcake uranium, so clearly a significant proportion of you aren't fussed. Still, no mission checkpoints?</p>
<p>There are other and more pressing reasons to no-sell the new Call Of Duty. It's being published by Microsoft, who like buying studios for billions and then laying loads of people off, and who continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">do business</a> (despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">individual divestments</a>) with armies participating in what the UN has formally termed a genocide. We did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">a big report</a> on protests against the company's Israeli military connections earlier in the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="426">Spring cleaning is too far away. You need to stay on top of it all year long. Tidying up once a week keeps things manageable, and with the right tool, it doesn’t have to feel like a chore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, Amazon has the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for a whopping 55% off, dropping the price from $600 down to just $270.</a> That’s a $340 savings — not bad for one of the best vacuums in the game.</p>
<p data-start="428" data-end="887">The Dyson V9 Motorbar is designed to make cleaning easier and actually kind of satisfying. Weighing in at just 4.6 pounds, it’s lightweight, ergonomic, and easy to maneuver around the house. Whether you’re tackling the floors, reaching up to dust the top of your curtains, or squeezing into tricky corners, this thing moves effortlessly with you. It works on just about any surface from hardwood and tile to carpet and transitions smoothly between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="889" data-end="1212">Need to clean a tight area? The Dyson V9 can quickly transform into a handheld vacuum, making it super versatile. You can take it outside to clean your car, tidy up the couch, or get crumbs out of those hard-to-reach crevices in the kitchen. It’s powerful enough for the big jobs yet compact enough for the quick ones.</p>
<p data-start="1214" data-end="1546">Since it’s cordless, you won’t have to deal with the constant unplug-replug routine as you move from room to room. The rechargeable battery gives you up to 40 minutes of run time, which is more than enough to handle most homes. Once you’re done, just dock it on the wall-mounted charger and let it power back up for next time.</p>
<p data-start="1548" data-end="1756">Emptying the bin is simple too. No need to get your hands dirty; just pull the release handle over a trash can, and the bottom pops open to drop out all the debris. It’s quick, clean, and easy.</p>


<h2>Hassle-free Hair Control</h2>
<p data-start="1758" data-end="2078">And if you’re dealing with pets (or just a lot of hair), the Dyson V9 Motorbar really shines. It includes a hair screw tool with a clever conical design that prevents long hairs from getting caught, wrapped up around the brush. That means less maintenance and more effective cleaning on pet beds, car seats, stairs, and couches.</p>
<p data-start="2080" data-end="2274" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been putting off cleaning because it feels like too much work, maybe it’s time to get a vacuum that actually makes it easy.. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, the Dyson V9 Motorbar is more than half off, sitting at just $270 for a limited time.</a></p>

    <p><span>Dialyn and Banyue join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “On the Precipice of the Abyss,” will launch on November 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1006879"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Following the Timesworn Hill crisis, an intertwined adventure unfolds in the old mining site as the Miasma begins to recede from the depths of the Lemnian Hollow in this new update. The arrival of agents Dialyn and Banyue from the Krampus Compliance Authority introduces not only new allies to the battlefield, but perhaps new judgment agendas as well.</p><p>With the assistance of the Krampus Compliance Authority—a TOPS-affiliated enforcement organization tasked with disciplinary oversight—the Proxies successfully averted a disaster beneath Timesworn Hill and glimpsed deeper mysteries waiting within Yidhari’s dreamscape. Fleeting visions revealed the figures of Sarah and Ye Shiyuan together—an unexpected sight, given that the senior member of Yunkui Summit is not thought to be involved in the conspiracy of the Exaltists and their Creator. Meanwhile, his younger sister, Ye Shunguang, now ascended as the new master of the Qingming Sword, joins the Proxies to embark on a journey to uncover the truth. As the Miasma recedes, the old mining site buried a decade ago resurfaces, hinting at new dangers and unseen forces stirring once more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1006882"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Amid the shifting order and chaos, two agents join the fray. Dialyn, an S-Rank Physical Stun Agent from Krampus brings her experience as a cheeky customer service specialist to the battlefield. Using two unique resources, Customer Complaint and Positive Review, she excels at stunning enemies while calling up teammates to directly unleash their Ultimate abilities in combat, amplifying the team’s damage. Banyue, an S-Rank Fire Rupture agent and a revered martial arts master, has fused countless techniques into a combination style of immense power and splendor. His combat technique relies on alternating Adrenaline and Wrathful Fires to sustain his continuous actions and fluid combos, rewarding players who master his rhythm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Two new Bangboo companions also join the battlefield in Version 2.4. Birkblick from Krampus features a multifunctional sensor array that transforms into a floating cannon during combat, scanning and bombarding targets with energy blasts. Meanwhile, the cheerful Bild N. Boolok wields a massive block hammer to smash enemies.</p><p>Beyond these new arrivals, Version 2.4 also welcomes back Agents Hugo (Attack – Ice) and Ellen (Attack – Ice). The beloved Bangboo auto chess event also returns with new upgrades—now featuring PvE special stages and offering exclusive rewards, including a free Bild N. Boolok. Meanwhile, the event Lightstream Notes invites players to enjoy New Eridu alongside Ye Shunguang, discovering fleeting moments of lightheartedness amid the deepening shadows.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,793 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.3 special program below.
