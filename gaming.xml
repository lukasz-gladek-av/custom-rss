			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>2025 has been a great year for role-playing games</strong></a>, and 2026 is setting out to be another incredible year for one of the most popular gaming genres around. While next year won't see the release of many new properties, 2026 will see the <strong>return of some beloved series</strong>, with new entries in their respective franchises as well as <strong>remakes that breathe new life</strong> in all time classics.</p>



<p>Here are the <strong>five RPGs</strong> officially confirmed for a 2026 launch that we feel deserve your attention the most at this point in time.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-february-6-2026-pc-playstation-5">Nioh 3 (February 6, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nioh-3.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>With its open-field mechanics and tight combat, Nioh 3 is one of the most anticipated RPGs launching in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Following games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,</strong></em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Rise of the Ronin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Team NINJA</strong>&nbsp;is finally returning to the series that has defined the studio's course since 2017: the&nbsp;<strong>Nioh series</strong>.</span></p>



<p>Unlike <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2</a></strong></em>, which refined the formula of its predecessor, bringing it to heights that made it rival FromSoftware games in terms of mechanical complexity, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> is set to provide a brand new experience with the introduction of <strong>open-fields</strong> that will provide a more involving way of engaging with the game's world inspired by different time periods in Japan, including the <strong>Sengoku and Bakumatsu eras</strong>.</p>



<p>This open-field approach, however, won't water down the mechanics that define the Nioh series. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">With the introduction of&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">two fighting styles - Samurai and Ninja - </strong>new mechanics inspired by other games developed by the studio, and a challenging, uncompromising experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;is set to become one of the&nbsp;best games by Team NINJA, if not the very best.</a></strong></span></p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-february-5-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will bring the seventh entry in the series to a whole new audience in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-new-information/"><strong><em>Dragon Quest XII</em> is nowhere to be seen</strong></a>, the popular JRPG franchise hasn't been dormant. Over the past couple of years, the first three entries in the series received excellent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">HD-2D makeovers</a></strong>, which will be followed this year by a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">full-on remake of Dragon Quest VII</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Although the seventh entry in the series was already remade on Nintendo 3DS, <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> is set to become the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"><strong>overhauling everything from visuals to gameplay.</strong></a> With its <strong>beautiful handcrafted artstyle and diorama environments</strong>, a streamlined story experience which aims at <strong>trimming the original's very long story</strong>, new scenarios focused on the Hero, Maribel and Keifer, an <strong>improved Vocations system</strong> with the ability to equip two Vocations per character, new spells and skills for an enhanced battle experience, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> promises to deliver the <strong>prime turn-based JRPG experience in 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to make the long wait for <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> more bearable? We will find out this February.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In early 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that former <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> director <strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong> had founded a new studio called <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. Later that year, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>NetEase</strong> had provided an investment to create a new <strong>triple-A RPG</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to be titled <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>. Their game is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being published</a> by <strong>Bandai Namco</strong>, though, which is why NetEase's move to pull back from many Western studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-isnt-in-any-danger-despite-netease-involvement-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not affect Rebel Wolves</a>.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker clearly borrows a lot from the framework of The Witcher III (which is only a great thing, as that is one of the finest open world RPGs ever made), but it also adds a few key innovations, such as the fact that there is essentially no difference between main and side quests. The protagonist, Coen, <strong>has 30 days to save his family</strong>; how to reach that goal is entirely up to the player. Tackling specific objectives is radically different during the day, when Coen is human, and at nighttime, when his vampiric abilities manifest. Because of these elements, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-freedom-closer-to-fallout-1-2-pen-paper-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> its role-playing freedom was <strong>inspired by pen-and-paper games</strong>.</p>



<p>Its setting and peculiar twist on vampire lore, with them actually coming out in the open and ruling the Carpathians-inspired Vale Sangora, is also intriguing. For more on The Blood of Dawnwalker, check out <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our exclusive interview with Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</a></strong> from Gamescom 2025.  </p>



<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">CONTROL Resonant (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>CONTROL Resonant is a major shake-up of its predecessor's formula that will deliver Remedy Entertainment's most ambitious experience to date</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/"><strong>a brilliant action-adventure title</strong></a>, <strong>Remedy</strong> is taking a <strong>"not-so-safe" approach</strong> for the sequel. <strong>CONTROL Resonant</strong> officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/"><strong>shifts the series into full-fledged action RPG territory</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Seven years after the original, the lockdown on the Oldest House has collapsed, and the <strong>paranatural chaos</strong> has spilled out into a <strong>quarantined, "open-ended" Manhattan</strong>. Stepping into the shoes of Jesse’s brother, <strong>Dylan Faden</strong>, players will have to fight this new reality-warping threat with the help of the <strong>Aberrant</strong>, a brutal, shapeshifting melee weapon that pairs with expanded psychic abilities.</p>



<p>With a heavy focus on <strong>build-crafting</strong>, varied enemy types that can match your mobility, and a <strong>meticulously authored version of New York City</strong>, <em>CONTROL Resonant</em> looks to be <strong>Remedy's most ambitious project to date</strong>, and one of the most interesting action RPGs to launch in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fable-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Fable (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fable-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It was early 2018 when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-game-confirmed-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard the first rumors</a> that <strong>Playground Games</strong> had decided to accept the arduous task of rebooting the long-dormant <strong>Fable</strong> series. The game itself was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, but it quickly became clear that it still had a long road ahead of its release. In 2022, a former Playground developer who worked on the project's early stages <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-progress-slow-playground-lack-of-rpg-experience-frugal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the studio's lack of experience with role-playing games and their frugal approach to development were slowing down progress.</p>



<p>Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2023</a> with an in-game trailer that featured actor <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2024</a> with a trailer that featured actor <strong>Matt King</strong> as well as some gameplay. More importantly, that trailer came with a promise of a <strong>2025 launch</strong>, which of course did not happen. In February 2025, Xbox Studios head <strong>Craig Duncan</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game required additional development time and was thus <strong>delayed until 2026</strong>, accompanied by some promising new gameplay footage.</p>



<p>There has been no further news from the studio. A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Fable might not even make it next year, although for now, there's no solid evidence to confirm that. As such, we remain hopeful in a 2026 release. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, 2026 is poised to be a fantastic year for role-playing games, and selecting only five titles proved to be a daunting task. Below are several more notable titles that are expected to make waves in the next 12 months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Top 10 Highest Rated Video Games Of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/top-10-highest-rated-video-games-of-2025/</link>
            <guid>1394785</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s no question about it: 2025 has been a standout year for video games. From massive AAA blockbusters to boundary-pushing indie gems, the release calendar has been stacked with quality, and many titles have earned widespread critical praise.</p>



<p>With the year drawing to a close, it’s the perfect moment to reflect on its strongest launches. This list is based solely on Metascore ratings from Metacritic. To qualify, a game must have been released in 2025 to <strong>over 25 critic reviews</strong>—apologies to The Legend of Zelda; as great as you are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we want new games, not ports.</p>







<p>If you’re searching for the cream of the crop, here are the ten highest-rated video games that released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-highest-rated-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Highest Rated Games Released In 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-monster-hunter-wilds">10. Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Just another day out in the Wilds. Image by Capcom.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter franchise</a> hardly needs an introduction. Venture through sprawling environments, craft and wield powerful weapons, and take down towering beasts—all in pursuit of better gear and ever-greater challenges. It’s a formula that has defined the series for years, and for good reason: it’s endlessly satisfying.</p>



<p>Capcom has long perfected this loop, and Monster Hunter Wilds showcases the series at its very best. It’s also the most approachable entry to date, making it an ideal starting point for newcomers. Whether you’re a veteran hunter or someone curious about diving in for the first time, Wilds stands tall as the newest and most impressive evolution of the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">9. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take a trip back to medieval Europe. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>It’s easy for early-year releases to slip from memory—especially in a stacked year like 2025—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> refuses to be forgotten. Its remarkable immersion and gripping atmosphere have kept it firmly in the spotlight, resonating with critics right through to the year’s end.</p>



<p>Nearly every aspect of the game is executed with exceptional polish. The cutscenes, writing, visuals, and core gameplay all stand as shining examples of what a modern RPG can strive to be. If you’re a fan of rich, grounded storytelling paired with deeply engaging, authentic gameplay, then this is one 2025 release you absolutely shouldn’t overlook.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-dispatch">8. Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Up there with the Telltale greats. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>Dispatch may not have launched with the same blockbuster buzz as some of 2025’s heavy hitters, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly made a name for itself</a>, as it settles in as one of the highest-rated games of the year. AdHoc Studio’s episodic adventure blends sharp writing with a clever superhero twist, placing you in the role of Robert Robertson III—a former hero now managing crises from behind the scenes as a dispatcher. </p>



<p>If you thought the gameplay was reminiscent of Telltale games of old, then you’d be right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AdHoc is made up of former Telltale veterans</a>, and Dispatch proudly channels that lineage with its branching choices, punchy character dialogue, and narrative-driven pacing. Each episode plays out as a slick animated series brought to life, backed by strong performances and confident direction. It’s tightly crafted, consistently entertaining, and a standout reminder of how impactful choice-based storytelling can be.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">7. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kojima at his best. Image by Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>There are few creators in the industry with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vision as distinctive as Hideo Kojima’s</a>, and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach might be his most striking showcase yet. At a glance, it may appear to be another atmospheric delivery-focused “walking sim,” sending players across sweeping landscapes with cargo in tow—but that surface-level read barely scratches the depth beneath. The sequel expands on the original’s foundations with richer mechanics, broader exploration, and a renewed emphasis on improvisation and survival.</p>



<p>At its core, Kojima once again crafts a story about human connection and the lengths we go to forge and maintain it. Every mechanic, from traversal to cargo management, serves a narrative purpose, reinforcing the themes woven throughout the journey. Combined with an exceptional cast delivering some of the year’s strongest performances, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> lands as one of 2025’s most affecting and ambitious releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-hollow-knight-silksong">6. Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The wait didn’t disappoint. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 90</strong></p>



<p>There were stretches over the past few years when it genuinely felt like the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight might never arrive. Team Cherry maintained an unwavering silence that became almost mythical in its own right, leaving fans to wonder if Silksong would remain a dream rather than a reality. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But when it finally launched</a>, the wait proved more than worthwhile—Silksong didn’t just meet expectations, it shattered them.</p>



<p>What makes the game so remarkable is how confidently it elevates every facet of the original. Movement and combat are faster, smoother, and more expressive than ever, giving Hornet a distinct identity that feels both familiar and thrillingly new. The world is richer and more atmospheric, the story deeper, and the level design more ambitious in scope. Silksong accomplishes what many believed impossible: it meaningfully improves on Hollow Knight, delivering an adventure that stands as one of the year’s defining triumphs and a masterclass in Metroidvania design.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-donkey-kong-bananza">5. Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>

<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Fans had been hoping for a Super Mario Odyssey sequel ever since the Switch classic was first released, but Nintendo ultimately had a different vision in mind. Donkey Kong Bonanza arrived as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananzas-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritual successor rather than a direct follow-up</a>—a game that channels Odyssey’s spirit while carving out its own bold identity.</p>







<p>What’s immediately clear is that it’s unapologetically a Donkey Kong adventure. The refined elegance of Mario is swapped for DK’s heavier, more powerful movement, giving the platforming a satisfyingly weighty feel. Yet the team didn’t abandon the fluidity that made Odyssey such a modern platforming masterpiece. Instead, they built upon it, designing levels with verticality, momentum, and environmental interaction tailored perfectly to DK’s strengths. The result is a vibrant, imaginative, and fiercely inventive 3D platformer, one that proudly stands as one of the best the genre has seen in years, and one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-split-fiction">4. Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hatch your very own dragons. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Hazelight Studios has practically redefined what co-op gaming can look like, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-is-on-course-to-outsell-it-takes-twos-20-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> carries that torch with confidence. It’s a game built entirely around collaboration—so much so that playing it solo is downright impossible. Its enforced teamwork isn’t a gimmick but one of its greatest strengths, pushing players to communicate, coordinate, and experience every moment together.</p>



<p>Even beyond its co-op brilliance, Split Fiction is an exceptional piece of game design. The sheer variety on display is astonishing: one moment you’re soaring across a fantasy realm atop a dragon, and the next you’re tearing through a neon sci-fi setting on a high-speed motorbike. Each sequence feels fresh, inventive, and packed with personality. It’s wild, imaginative, and endlessly entertaining.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-blue-prince">3. Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll never stop exploring. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Blue Prince emerged as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s standout indie hits</a>, offering a clever blend of mystery, strategy, and roguelike design. You play as Simon P. Jones, tasked with uncovering the hidden 46th room inside the ever-shifting Mt. Holly Estate. Each day, the mansion reshuffles itself, forcing you to reopen doors, navigate new layouts, and piece together clues as you steadily rebuild your understanding of its labyrinthine structure.</p>



<p>What makes Blue Prince so captivating is how it turns that unpredictability into a deeply satisfying puzzle. Every run reveals new fragments of lore, fresh room combinations, and surprising twists that make the mansion feel alive. It’s inventive, atmospheric, and endlessly replayable, making it one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-clair-obscur-expedition-33">2. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Race against time. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Explaining why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ranks among the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sets-record-as-2025s-best-third-party-xbox-game-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated games of the year</a> is almost impossible—not because the reasons are scarce, but because there are so many to choose from. The turn-based fantasy RPG blends a stunning Belle Époque–inspired aesthetic with a gripping, emotionally charged narrative, all while pushing the boundaries of what a modern turn-based RPG can be. Its combat system, worldbuilding, and striking visual identity come together in a way that feels both refreshingly new and instantly timeless.</p>



<p>It’s rare for a studio to deliver a debut title with this level of polish and ambition, yet that’s exactly what Sandfall Interactive has achieved. The French team has crafted something bold, beautiful, and unforgettable—an experience that resonates long after the credits roll. After all, there’s a reason it became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most nominated game ever at The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hades-2">1. Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hauntingly beautiful. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 95</strong></p>



<p>Hades 2 arriving in 2025 felt like the gaming world collectively holding its breath—and Supergiant Games delivered in a way only they could. After spending some time in early access, the sequel takes everything that made the original so beloved and expands it with confidence, introducing a new protagonist, a richer world, and even deeper layers of mythology to explore. The moment-to-moment gameplay is as sharp and addictive as ever, but there’s a newfound elegance in how combat, progression, and narrative flow together, making each run feel meaningful.</p>



<p>What elevates Hades 2 even further is how effortlessly it balances familiarity with innovation. Supergiant’s signature art style and storytelling return in full force, but the expanded cast, refined systems, and fresh environments give the sequel a flavour entirely its own. It’s bigger, bolder, and often more surprising than its predecessor—no small feat considering the heights the first game reached. In a year stacked with standout releases, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines as the highest-rated game released in 2025</a>.</p>

		<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/">dealabs.com</a> has got the scoop on one of the games coming to PS Plus January 2026. According to their sources, the main title for January will be Need for Speed: Unbound on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Need for Speed Unbound - Speed Race Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBPZapIh4MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Criterion developed the game and it was published in 2022 by EA, and when it was released we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/05/need-for-speed-unbound-review/">9/10 in our review</a>, calling it “the best arcade racer of 2022”. Since then it has had multiple updates but support for the game ended in in 2024 when Criterion moved on to help make Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 title is the PS5 version as Sony&nbsp; announced that January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>

<p><em>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 games should be officially revealed later today on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/">PlayStation Blog.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</h4>
<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December until January 6th, 2026</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>The Outlast Trials</strong>&nbsp;| PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Synduality Echo of Ada</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>Neon White</strong>&nbsp;| PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s Fighting Game 2XKO Is Getting a Full Launch on PC & Consoles on January 20, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/</link>
            <guid>1394758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2025 early access debut on PC</a>, <strong>Riot</strong> is preparing to launch the fighting game <strong>2XKO</strong> as a full release on both PC and consoles. An announcement trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVTEIoD_S0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published a few hours ago on YouTube</a> by Riot but quickly went private, which means someone posted it beforehand. Still, even though it technically counts as a 'leak', it's the kind where the official source self-leaks the news in advance, and so can be considered accurate.</p>



<p>2XKO has been a long time coming. It all started after Radiant Entertainment, the studio that made <strong>Rising Thunder</strong> (as well as the city builder Stonehearth), was acquired by Riot in 2016. While that meant the cancellation of Rising Thunder, the founders, the <strong>Cannon brothers</strong>, quickly started working on a new fighting game under Riot.</p>



<p>That wasn't very surprising. Despite Stonehearth, the Cannon brothers were always more interested in fighting games than anything else; after all, they founded the <strong>Evolution Championship Series</strong> and also developed the <strong>GGPO</strong> middleware, which provided the <strong>rollback netcode technology</strong> now practically mandatory for any self-respecting fighting game with online functionality.</p>



<p>It took many years to get this new project running, though. The first confirmation that they were indeed working on a new fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-rising-thunder-devs-are-indeed-working-on-a-fighting-game-at-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in August 2019</a>, but it wasn't until August 2022 that fans got another major update, when the developers<a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-goes-free-to-play-new-fighter-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealed</a> that it would be a free-to-play title. The game's title, 2XKO, was only announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2024</a>. That's also when we learned the first actual details on the game, which is a 2v2 tag-team fighting game where players select two characters from Riot's League of Legends setting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2XKO Official Cinematic: Ties That Bind ft. Courtney LaPlante of Spiritbox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyK3lFtz2H8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One champion starts as the "Point," while the other starts as the "Assist." Players can tag in and out to swap active fighters, creating a four-player arena. Active tagging lets you call in assists mid-combo to extend damage or set up mix-ups. Furthermore, tag-in timing is crucial to offensive flow.</p>



<p>In an attempt to improve accessibility to those who aren't well-versed in the genre, there are no traditional quarter-circle or dragon-punch motions in 2XKO; instead, champions use button combinations. Another key feature of the game is the Fuse system, a team-building customization mechanic (similar to League keystones) that grants abilities like back-to-back assist calling, increased damage at health advantage, or dual ultimates, allowing users to customize duo synergies and playstyles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The State Of The Nintendo Switch 2 In 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It doesn’t feel like Nintendo just released a new console. Last year around this time we were inundated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408"><span>weekly leaks</span></a><span> about the Switch 2. They all pointed to the same thing: it would be a bigger, more powerful version of the console we already knew and loved. Nintendo kicked 2025 off by showing us a Switch 2 that was exactly that. It launched in June to significant fanfare and hype, and there has been surprisingly little to say about the Switch 2 ever since.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks lean, feels sleek, and runs older blockbusters and even some newer ones surprisingly well. But its boldest innovation is a video sharing feature that feels </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-one-will-play-uno-on-a-console-really-why-bother-looking-back-at-uno-the-xbox-live-arcade-hit-that-thrust-social-play-onto-the-360-generation"><span>plucked out of 2006</span></a><span> and which I never hear anyone talk about. The quintessential smartphone upgrade of video game consoles, the Switch 2 set launch sales records but dominated the conversation less than anyone expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo’s latest flagship console doesn’t break the mold. It remains, first and foremost, a machine for playing Nintendo games, most of which are sequels to franchises that have been around since the last millennium. And it does that splendidly, even if the games themselves haven’t always cleared the lofty bar set by the Switch 1’s first year. Do I sound a little disappointed? I’m trying not to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>2025 was a transition year for Nintendo’s hardware; one that feels less like a clear passing of the baton than an extended farewell where everyone spends an extra 15 minutes gossipping at the door while putting on their coats before actually saying goodbye. The Switch 1 was a must-buy in 2017. In 2025 the Switch 2 is more of a nice-to-have.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Hardware</h2> <p><span>You can tell when a certain line of hardware has matured by what people focus on. The raw specs? A refined form factor? New software features? With the Switch 2, it’s a satisfying but mostly inconsequential gimmick. One of the first things anyone will do with the new device is feel the tug of magnets as the new Joy-Con click into place on the sides of the console. A hundred times later, it still delights me and yields an unwarranted flash of joy. If only the thumb-stick nubs weren’t still garbage.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing that stands out most about the Switch 2 is how much faster it charges. While the battery life overall isn’t very impressive, and is still sapped surprisingly quickly even in sleep mode, it’s now possible to get a mostly full charge in just one hour. This isn’t a reason to upgrade a console, but it’s one of the things I spend the most time doing with my Switch 2 besides playing it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The screen, slightly larger than that of its predecessor, also feels surprisingly revelatory. It’s like you’ve been driving with the sun visor down and then you lift it up to reveal the rest of the horizon. The addition of those few inches of space feels like having a blast shield lifted from your face. It’s not OLED, but the resolution is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the overall build quality feels nice. Setting HDR correctly, though, is a pain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656191"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656191">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Most importantly, the guts of the machine delivered the type of next-gen upgrade you’d want from a device that costs $150 more than its predecessor did at launch. It kept up well with modern third-party blockbusters like </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws,</span></i><span> and ran first-party Nintendo games with sprawling worlds, like</span><i><span> Mario Kart World </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, with no major issues, at least in docked mode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The old Switch, meanwhile, is harder than ever to go back to. The screen is small, the bezels feel that much larger, and the OS lags more than my two-year-old on a one-mile walk around the neighborhood. The hardware has held up well mechanically, but is hanging off the edge of a cliff when it comes to actual game performance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans have been seeing the original Switch show its age with new releases for years now, but </span><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span> are likely to serve as the final nails in the coffin for anyone trying to stick it out on the less capable last-gen machines. Are the games busted on Switch 1? Not at all. Can you enjoy them? Definitely. Would I recommend just holding off until you eventually buy a Switch 2? Absolutely.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s worth noting that, like the Switch 2, the original Switch also saw a price hike in 2025. It now costs $40 more than it did at launch. The used prices for the old hardware, thankfully, have remained surprisingly low. A secondhand Switch Lite for $100 was probably the best deal in games this year.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Software</h2> <p><span>The Switch 2 interface remains stubbornly barebones in an era when the Xbox Series X/S and PS5 continue to add new bells and whistles to their home screen experiences. Customization options are minimal. The row of icons constantly jiggles around based solely on what you played last. Tons of blank real estate above and below is still a wasteland, with no backgrounds to swap to besides night mode.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>GameChat, the Switch 2’s actual big back-of-the-box feature, performs fine, but feels unmoored from the broader console experience. Meanwhile, the console itself can play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> better than its predecessor, but compared to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, the Switch 2 remains just as fundamentally uninterested in being a social hub as the Switch was.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s the only major gaming platform not to be integrated with the biggest communication platform for gaming: Discord. Sharing game capture and images now requires a dedicated smartphone app from Nintendo’s ever-growing repository of console features outsourced to second screens. It’s not a terrible idea in principle, but it doesn’t feel sane or streamlined in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656193">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2025 was the year that Nintendo tried to divorce itself from the increasingly unstable broader internet. It set up a dedicated Nintendo Today! news app that is sometimes the only place to find out about things like the upcoming </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> movie, but is more often than not just a glorified calendar for sharing existing character art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s also a dedicated app for parental controls, music, and more. None of it is organically integrated into the actual device fans just spent a ton of money on. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-music-too-many-switch-2-iphone-phone-2000641401"><span>The whole setup</span></a><span> is, frankly, insane.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some bright spots for Nintendo’s on-system user-experience in 2025, however. It established virtual card sharing to allow users to lend out digital games across different devices as long as they’re linked by a family group or share a user profile. It’s a process that looks more complicated on paper than it feels in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It makes the experience of jumping back and forth between the original Switch and the Switch 2 a lot more seamless than it was with any previous generational leaps in Nintendo’s history. The only downside is that cloud save syncing can’t always keep up. It’s a step in the right direction, but still a far cry from Microsoft’s brave new “play anywhere” future.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Another bone Nintendo threw to older Switch owners was GameShare, a way to use multiplayer across multiple devices in the same room. While GameShare works online via GameChat for Switch 2 owners, it also works locally for those with the old handheld hybrid. It works surprisingly well for things like</span><i><span> Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span> multiplayer, streaming the game to an old Switch for player two. It runs at lower resolution and framerates, but is a nice option that adds utility to the older hardware, even if it’s probably going to stay a niche feature over the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Services</h2> <p><span>Switch Online expanded in a big way this year with the addition of GameCube games. Exclusive to Switch 2, the new classic console experience kicked off with </span><i><span>F-Zero GX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Soulcalibur II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</span></i><span> in June, followed by</span><i><span> Super Mario Strikers</span></i><span> in July, </span><i><span>Chibi-Robo!</span></i><span> in August,</span><i><span> Luigi’s Mansion</span></i><span> in October, and </span><i><span>Wario World</span></i><span> in December.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Games like </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</span></i><span> remain MIA for now, and it’ll be interesting to see how much the library expands into third-party releases. It added a lot of value to the existing $50-a-year Expansion Pack subscription, which also gained access to paid Switch 2 upgrades for Switch games like </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656192">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But one thing Nintendo didn’t do was bring back Virtual Console, or some other mechanism for buying old games a la carte. Entire months still go by without any new classics added to any of the console back catalogs. And glaring omissions like</span><i><span> Super Smash Bros. 64</span></i><span> raise questions about whether some games will ever be added to the service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Switch Online, which is still just $20 a year, will become mandatory for GameChat access starting after March 31, 2026. At the same time, users are getting other benefits like new music in Nintendo’s Spotify-like app for game soundtracks. Practically every week gets new tracks for games ranging from </span><i><span>Metroid 2</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</span></i><span>, though obvious albums like </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> are still missing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, other benefits have been dropped from the service. Just in time for the new console’s release, Nintendo ditched its gold coins system that gave players cash back on eShop purchases, and is similarly sunsetting its Switch Game Vouchers program, a series of coupons that let fans get new games at a discount. Done right, it was one way to keep gaming on Switch more affordable. Instead, being a Nintendo fan is only getting more expensive amid tariffs, $80 games, and Switch 2 upgrade fees.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Games</h2> <p><span>It was an eclectic year for Switch and Switch 2 releases, if not one that will be remembered like 2017, when Nintendo launched a new console into one of the best lineups in its history. </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> initially dazzled but doesn’t feel as full-bodied as </span><i><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></i><span> does after years of post-release updates and DLC. Despite issuing a number of balance updates, the company has been weird about actually letting fans play the game the way they want to online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New add-ons for </span><i><span>Mario Party Jamboree</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</span></i><span> were nice upgrade incentives but hardly groundbreaking. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span>, for all of director Masahiro Sakurai’s pre-release hype, was nice, fun, </span><i><span>fine</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, an unexpected highlight, provided a novel gimmick and a crowd-pleasing ending to bookend an otherwise B+ experience. </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span>, despite the nearly decade-long wait, was also less than transformative.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000000903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000903"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000903">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> delivered for</span><i><span> Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> fans, bolstering what would have been an otherwise disappointing inaugural holiday season for the Switch 2, but it did not quite transform the franchise the way Switch 1 iterations of some long-standing series did. There was certainly no shortage of new Nintendo releases in 2025, from </span><i><span>Mario Galax</span></i><span>y remasters to </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span> upgrades, but nothing that quite lived up to the sky-high expectations attached to the new hardware around this time last year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But Nintendo has done a good job of building up the Switch 2’s initial base of third-party support. Ubisoft showed up with ports that underpromised and over-delivered, even as others like </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> were indefinitely delayed. </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hitman: World of Assassination</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i><span> all showed the breadth of what fans might expect heading into this new Nintendo console generation, which is access to many of the biggest modern games around, available with fewer compromises than expected, at least early on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you look at the 10 highest-rated releases of the year according to Metacritic, seven of them are available on Switch and four of them, including </span><i><span>Hades 2</span></i><span>, are console exclusives. It’s not hard to see the rest, including </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue Prince</span></i><span>, eventually coming to the platform in 2026. At least for now, Switch 2 is shaping up to have a broader powerhouse library of games than its predecessor. The only real question is whether Nintendo can raise the bar again, or has hit its current ceiling.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Future</h2> <p><span>There were four things that made the first year of the original Switch so special: portability, indie games, a great</span><i><span> Mario</span></i><span> game, and a groundbreaking </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>. The Switch 2 benefited from none of those things in quite the same way. It still feels like we’re in the warm-up phase. Nintendo isn’t one to rest on its laurels, but it’s also looking beyond just games these days.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s biggest release of 2026 probably won’t be on Switch 2. If it performs as well as the first one, </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i><span> will, in terms of cultural reach and box office prowess, outshine anything that the company can stick on a cartridge. It opened a new Super Nintendo World theme park location in Orlando this year, and continues branching out into real-world experiences, new stores, more toys, and other transmedia products.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Switch 2 feels like the Switch 1 all grown up, and it is both more useful and more boring as a result. It wears a half-zip, pays its bills on time, and always shows up on time at the bar. It has its shit together. Give it your money. It’s the gaming equivalent of investing your 401k in an index fund.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But can Nintendo still flood it with imaginative possibilities that surprise and delight the way it did with releases like Labo and </span><i><span>Ring Fit</span></i><span> on the Switch in its early years? Will it give us fresh gameplay ideas and new franchises, or reinvent the old ones to the point where they feel almost unrecognizable? That will be the test for the Switch 2 in 2026 and beyond. Especially if Nintendo is going to start charging more for it, as some analysts are </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hardware-prices-will-not-fall-industry-analysts-are-extremely-concerned-about-console-prices-wouldnt-be-shocked-if-the-nintendo-switch-2-costs-more-in-2026/"><span>currently speculating aloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Switch 2 is good enough, but it still has a lot to prove. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This New Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild VR Mod Is Awesome]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-new-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-is-awesome-2000656152</link>
            <guid>1394575</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a new way to experience Nintendo’s fantastic <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</em> A completely free virtual reality mod for the open-world RPG is out now, letting you hop into Hyrule like never before, and it looks amazing.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR"><em>BetterVR</em> is a newly released mod</a> for the Wii U-emulated version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-breath-of-the-wild-helped-me-love-food-again-1842385671"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> that lets you play through the entirety of the game through the eyes of Link himself. You’ll need a copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> on Wii U, a somewhat powerful PC, the Cemu emulator, and, of course, a virtual reality headset like the Meta Quest 3. But if you have all that, you can now virtually explore <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in a whole new way.</p>

  <p>This is a fully stereo-rendered VR experience with 6DOF and no alternated eye rendering. <em>BetterVR</em> also supports full hand and arm tracking, letting you chop down trees and fight monsters by flailing around. (You can also use normal button commands if you prefer, of course.) It also features customized VR controls, like reaching behind your back to grab your sword, so it should play and feel like a native VR game.</p>

 <p>I’m not surprised this VR mod is so good. The team behind it, Flat2VR, are the same folks who created the <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782">excellent<em> Half-Life 2 VR</em> mod that is as good as Valve’s very own</a><em> Half-Life: Alyx.</em> The team has also ported other games to VR and has even developed commercially released ports of titles, like <em>Roboquest VR.</em> Even with all that experience, however, making this mod wasn’t easy, as explained in a thorough writeup on the mod’s GitHub page. They had to reverse engineer a lot of how<em> Breath of the Wild</em> worked and then translate that into something that could be rendered and played in VR. The end result is impressive as heck, and I’m almost tempted to download this mod and set up an emulator to check it out. I wasn’t a big fan of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> but maybe this would change my mind.</p>

 <p>As for how Nintendo lawyers will react to this, who can say? The project seems confident enough that it will be fine, <a href="https://x.com/Flat2VR/status/2005107315041513621">as the team has been posting about it publicly for days</a> before it launched on Tuesday. Seeing as the mod itself contains zero <em>Breath of the Wild</em> files, I’d say <em>BetterVR</em> is probably safe, but you never know with Nintendo.</p>

Its new OneXSugar Wallet is reminiscent of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen">folding OneXSugar Sugar 1 handheld</a> that launched earlier this year. But instead of two screens, the Wallet handheld unfolds to reveal just one big 8.01-inch OLED screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/onexsugar-wallet-is-first-android-handheld-with-a-foldable-screen/">spotted by <em>Retro Handhelds</em></a>.</p><p>The OneXSugar Wallet was <a href="https://weibo.com/7972483950/QkG4HEdwD">announced on China’s Weibo yesterday</a>, but with few details about its features and capabilities. That folding OLED screen has a resolution of 2480 x 1860 pixels, and the handheld will be powered by an unspecified “Qualcomm gaming platform flagship processor,” but its performance and emulation capabilities are unknown.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://weibo.com/7578408888/QkG3sFFlL?pagetype=profilefeed">photos and a video released by One-Netbook</a>, the OneXSugar Wallet will feature a standard set of controls including asymmetrical thumbsticks, four action buttons, and a D-pad situated on either side of the lower half of its display. There are also shoulder buttons and triggers on the back of the handheld and a pair of front-facing speakers flanking the top half of the screen. The biggest question is how much will the handheld cost? There are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">$1,000 handheld consoles</a>, but folding screen devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795298/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/phones/701076/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are priced closer to $2,000. Will gamers embrace the OneXSugar Wallet if it’s similarly expensive? Maybe it’s called the Wallet for a reason.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/851401/one-netbook-onexsugar-gaming-handheld-wallet-folding-oled-screen-android]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rainbow Six Siege is still struggling today after hackers gave out "billions" in in-game currency, forcing Ubisoft to briefly "intentionally" shut down the game.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft has not shared much of the details, players reported that the hackers banned - and unbanned - thousands of players, took control of the ban feed, gave all players 2 billion credits and renown each, and unlocked every premium skin for all players without charge.</p>
<p>Hackers then banned dozens of fake accounts "so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean" on-screen, as seen below.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft says the issue is now resolved, the game's service page suggests issues persist right across the board.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Rainbow Six Siege was hacked, and the hackers gave players billions in in-game currency.</p><p>The hackers also banned dozens of fake accounts in a sequence so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson.<a href="https://t.co/pWPFSFbwav">pic.twitter.com/pWPFSFbwav</a></p></div>— Romulus Industries (@RomulusInd) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomulusInd/status/2005150413520339315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>After <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808">notifying</a> players of an "incident" on 27th December, the publisher "intentionally shut down" both Siege and its Marketplace "while the team focuses on resolving the issue".</p>
<p>It also confirmed that while it had rolled back erroneous transactions, "nobody will be banned for spending credits received" and reminded players that the ban ticker had been turned off in a prior update.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.

</p></div>
<p>"An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but is not related to this incident," Ubisoft added. "We are working very hard to make sure this is resolved and players can play again.</p>
<p>"A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes," the team added in a subsequent update on X/Twitter. "The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible.</p><p>"Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this."</p>
<p>Then, on 28th December, Ubisoft launched a "soft launch", which only opened the game to a "small number of players only" while it completed live tests. Yesterday, 29th December, tests concluded and the game opened up to all again.</p>
<p>As a consequence, however, players experienced queues whilst connecting, and while players who didn't log in during the affected period should see no changes, those who did "may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks".</p>
<p>The Marketplace remains closed "until further notice".</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience as we work hard to investigate the cause of these known issues and ensure the whole community can get back to playing Siege," Ubisoft said in its latest official <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005702094913671606?s=20">communication</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, however, the game's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">service status page</a> suggests "unplanned" outages persist, with connectivity, authentication, in-game store, and matchmaking all listed as "degraded" or showing a complete "outage" across every single platform (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems). It's unclear why at this time. </p>

<p>Many insects are matriarchal creatures. For termites, honey bees, praying mantises, ants, and spiders (shh, I know they’re arachnids), their colonies and societies are led by females or defined by female-controlled structures. They range from groups driven by female workers to matriarchs responsible for breeding and raising the entire colony.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957xwvqjn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So it makes perfect sense that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a game governed by its women. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> certainly embraces part of this with its true final boss in The Radiance. But from its very first encounter all the way to the finale, Silksong’s women drive the plot forward. It goes way beyond being led by Hornet, a half-spider, half-wyrm who became The Knight’s ally in the first game.</p>
<p>In Pharloom and the Citadel, a world ensnared by silk and gripped by song, women are everything. Women are guides who help Hornet and chart the corridors of Pharloom. They’re powerful keepers of knowledge who bear the history of this broken kingdom will do whatever it takes to save it. They’re mothers, sisters, daughters, family who love and have let down, who have been forgotten or driven mad. They’re people who have suffered and struggled and continue to struggle.</p>
<p>Hornet herself is the perfect hero for Silksong’s narrative, one defined by systems of oppression, of familial and generational trauma, of class divides and religious control. Initially stripped of many of her powers and skills, she struggles and climbs — physically and mentally — to the top of the Citadel, before collapsing back down to the bottom. I know I’m beating the drum of “the struggle is the point” here, but the gameplay ties so beautifully with those aforementioned themes, including womanhood, I will continue to beat the same rhythm.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ecfb1a2b1b397"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecfb1a2b1b397/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of Silksong's toughest challenges come in the form of female figures. The Last Judge, the notorious roadblock between the end of Act 1 and the beginning of Act 2, is among the most fearsome bosses in the game, battering you with a fiery thurible and crimson embers over and over again, in a chamber drowning in her bellowing screams and her face obscured by what looks like a tear-stained mask.</p>
<p>Then there are the Weavers – Widow and her tricks that use threads to manipulate bells and overwhelm Hornet, while First Sinner is a lightning-fast combatant who teleports and zips around the arena breathlessly. These are female figures that define Pharloom’s history.</p>
<p>It isn’t like Hornet is weak, either. She’s a powerful woman raised by powerful women; her mother is Herrah the Beast, she trained under the Hive Queen Vespa, and was mentored for a time by The White Queen. She carries that strength, displaying confidence and pragmatism while always treating everyone with respect. Even when her eventual rival, Lace, taunts her on their first meeting, she does not mock her back: <em>“Your threats are worthless, child. If you are my foe, stay your voice and raise your blade.”</em></p>
<p>Just like how Hornet contrasts The Knight, other roles filled by men or male-presenting figures in Hollow Knight are now often held by women. Shakra is a very different cartographer than Cornifer; a warrior by nature, she is hunting for her missing mentor. She’s an immense help to Hornet throughout the game, defined by so much more than her strength and her ability to map the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="665b5377b312d"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/665b5377b312d/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, Shakra is a woman of tradition; she is found by scattered throwing rings and the dulcet tones of her singing voice. She comes to greatly respect Hornet throughout the journey, recognising her as a fellow warrior. And even though she’s not from the inner areas of Pharloom, like Bone Bottom or the Citadel, in Act 3 she still takes up the mantle as defender of Bellhart when the Void begins to overwhelm.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Bell Beast is your Last Stag of Silksong, and she’s the complete opposite. Active, vocal, and a fan of pets, Bella (yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-why-focus-on-silksongs-difficulty-when-we-need-to-talk-about-how-cute-it-is">I named her</a>) comes to love Hornet because she saved her from being ensnared in silk. Even if Hornet has to knock a bit of sense into her.</p>
<p>And, like Shakra, the Bell Beast undergoes a bit of a transformation in Act 3. My heart leapt into my throat when I rang the bell at the Bellway and my trusty companion didn’t arrive, instead replaced by the Bell Eater. Luckily, I had nothing to worry about, as after confronting the monstrous centipede-like creature and struggling, the Beast emerges and takes it down. Reunited with her companion, she introduces her litter of adorable children, and the five of them sing as Hornet plays the Needolin.</p>

<p>The Bell Beast has a reason to protect Pharloom – she’s a mother. Acting as a mirror to Hollow Knight once again, which focused on failed father figures and broken families, Silksong casts a much wider net on the theme, encompassing mothers and mother-like figures from every corner of life. From the Moss Mother to the splinters and the ants, as anyone who walked into Hunter’s March early on and got battered to death knows, family and motherhood is the heart of Silksong.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ants, the once-great leader, Skarrsinger Karmelita (matriarchal ants, remember?), is among the strongest characters I faced in Silksong. Before diving into her memory, she asks Hornet, “My strength... my power... Could you claim it, pale beast? Are you so strong?...”, which is pretty apt because in her prime, Karmelita humbled me with both her aria and her battle prowess for <em>hours.</em> Given that she was the only leader who could protect her tribe from the allure of the silk (for a time) thanks to the power of her voice, her strength should be no surprise.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15dd1dca43aee"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15dd1dca43aee/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>She is a mix of stereotypical masculine and feminine qualities, but her position as matriarch, as leader, is undeniable. Graceful, respectful, and with hundreds of loyal followers who support and protect her, she’s a great contrast to the aptly-named Grand Mother Silk, the figure behind all of Pharloom's ills. Where Karmelita cares about her tribe, Grand Mother wishes only to be the absolute ruler.</p>
<p>As a pale higher being who was abandoned by her “daughters” (the Weavers), Grand Mother Silk is haunting the silk and using her power to get people to worship her, driving them mad. She even goes as far as to fashion more children from silk to love her. One of those is Lace, a dutiful daughter driven mad by her desire to simply make her mother happy. She is the child of a mother who has done many bad things, burdened with the weight of those sins and the choices she has to make for her parental figure, including bringing Hornet to Pharloom to satisfy her.</p>

<p>Eventually, it drives Lace to self-loathing: If you play the Needolin during the second fight with her in The Cradle, she’ll sing <em>“Why her... Mother… See me cut! See me serve!”</em> Eventually, Lace rebels and at the start of Act 3, she cuts her mother’s arm off to free Hornet from falling into the Void. Lace instead goes down, but her mother does make one sacrifice: she cocoons Lace to protect her as best as she can, at the gradual cost of her soul.</p>
<p>Lace’s attempt at breaking free from her mother, of lashing out at her, results in her becoming dependent on her. Pharloom is still ensnared by the pale mother’s silken grip, now tainted with the darkness below. And it’s only right that Lace is saved by Hornet at the end, pulled from the Void and allowed to live freely. Lace made that choice by cutting her mother’s arm off, and Hornet allows her to see that choice through.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9bf2b4f2004f5"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9bf2b4f2004f5/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Women breaking free and taking a stand happens throughout Silksong; Shakra and the Bell Beast were just two examples, and while it isn’t exclusive to women, it does feel different when framed through their struggles.</p>
<p>Even Hornet’s journey, beyond simply freeing Pharloom, is about breaking free and retaining her agency. Slapping Nuu at the first signs of approach or scolding Kratt after he spies on her in the flea spa are a few simple moments of this – ones that made me chuckle at first, but later realise just how important they were to maintaining Silksong’s respect for its female characters.</p>
<p>This respect stretches to the path to the Cursed Child ending and getting the Witch Crest. This involves putting Hornet through a horrendous experience that “curses” her after a parasite is forcibly inserted into her body. It completely changes how Hornet’s body functions and how she plays – she can’t heal, she can’t use tools, and she can’t use Silk Skills.</p>
<figure data-uuid="997510ca30c95"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/997510ca30c95/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Even Grindle gets a taste of Hornet's medicine — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this “curse”, Hornet can either defeat Grand Mother Silk, or she can seek the help of Yarnaby, a disgraced doctor who was kicked out of Bellhart because of her practices. It’s a not-subtle story about bodily autonomy, forced motherhood, and overcoming trauma. Yarnaby, an outcast, extracts the “curse” from Hornet, which in turn gives you the Witch Crest.</p>
<p>We all know the historical connotations of the word '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(archetype)">witch</a>', especially related to women and the persecution we (and many others) have so often faced when branded with that term. But quests like this remind us that choice is a powerful thing and, if we have the space to make a choice, we should, for we — everyone — define ourselves by our choices.</p>

<p>Without womanhood, and without its women, Silksong would be a very different game. It ties into all of the thematic riches of the narrative beautifully, and there are so many powerful women throughout Pharloom, beyond even the few I’ve talked about, such as Jubilana, Neyleth, and the Forge Daughter.</p>
<p>When I reflect on Silksong, I think about all the girls who grew up playing video games, particularly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>. Seeing Samus remove her suit for the first time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/soapbox_super_metroid_showed_me_i_had_the_right_to_exist">must have been incredible</a>; I knew about this ‘twist’ before playing any game, and it still felt incredible to be playing as a woman with power and autonomy in a way few other games have since.</p>
<p>Hornet might just be “a bug”, but her journey throughout Pharloom is an important one for women. We’re not perfect beings, and Silksong isn’t shy about saying that. Hornet herself messes up in not recognising the Snail Shaman’s plans to use the Void to trap Grand Mother Silk. But she makes a choice to save these people, to liberate those who have suffered under the silken thread for so long. To free herself of the curse. To save Lace and let her live her own life.</p>
<p>Amidst the oppression of Pharloom, there is hope, there is a chance to break free. And the women will lead the charge.</p>

            <p>Former Rockstar technical director, Obbe Vermeij, has commended <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios for walking away from the hugely successful Dungeons &amp; Dragons series, calling it a "bold move".</p>
<p>Reflecting on the difficulties of moving on from critically-acclaimed properties - much like when he himself moved on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> in 2009 after games like GTA 3, GTA 4, Vice City, and San Andreas - Vermeij spoke to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">Games Hub</a> in a wide-ranging interview, intimating Larian had made a "risky" decision.</p>

<p>"It's quite cool to see Larian Studios, who just did Baldur’s Gate 3, and they've said, 'we don't feel like Baldur’s Gate 4. We're just gonna do another game'. And you know, good for them.</p>
<p>"But it's a bold move. It's not obvious. It's very risky. It's easier to just keep on doing what you’re doing.</p>
<p>"The reality is if you have a studio that has one mega successful game, it just doesn't make sense to do any wild changes," he added (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-4-larian-turned-down-rockstar-lead-respect/">TheGamer</a>), suggesting that it was tempting to "put [whatever weird ideas you have] into GTA rather than just launching an entirely new game".</p><p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow up on its use of generative AI</a>, following a huge backlash earlier this month. In a statement, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include any AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Vermeji is now working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044790/Plentiful/">Plentiful</a>, a sandbox god game where you can sculpt the land, redirect rivers, and guide your people "through a perilous Stone Age".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[17 Of The Year’s Biggest PS5 Games Are Up To 50 Percent Off]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-deals-soulslike-rpg-goty-discount-sale-2000656129</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>
