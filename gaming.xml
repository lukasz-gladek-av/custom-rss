            <p>
I confess, I'm writing up the 1.0 release date for grubby open world game Vivat Slovakia less because I'm tantalised by the carboot sale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> aesthetic, than because the latest trailer ends with main character Trotter squatting weirdly on a coffee table. He perches there with track-suited elbows akimbo, smiling faintly. Mockingly.

Trotter aside, the table sustains various piles of money and a bottle of what could be Jack Daniels. The room containing Trotter and the table also contains two high-collared chairs, an expansive, dimpled sofa, and some well-fitted bookcases. There is a dog in one of the chairs, while the sofa is being used to prop up some guns. Sunlight streams through the conservatory windows behind, lending the whole scene the quality of an angelic visitation.
</p>
<p>
What to make of this? Why is Trotter squatting on a table? His amused rictus contains no answer. Nor is there any catharsis to be found on the Steam page, which characterises him as an undercover cop and taxi driver, making his way through a 10 km² city map based on post-Communist 1990s Slovakia. I feel the need to workshop this bizarre spectacle before I can say anything further about the game. There's nothing for it - I'm going to have to write a quick listicle.
</p>
<h3>Seven reasons Trotter is squatting on that coffee table</h3>
<p>
1. Trotter is squatting on the table simply to free up a chair for his dog. He is doing this because he loves his dog like a child, and considers it a crime against Very Good Boys to ask the beast to sleep on the floor. Still, that doesn't explain the other, apparently vacant chair and the sofa.
</p>
<p>
2. The dog is Trotter's landlord, who has cruelly forbidden Trotter from sitting on people furniture. What more dastardly an archnemesis for "a city that reflects the tumult of an era caught between communism and capitalism"? You can't quite see it in the video, but the dog is definitely smoking a cigar.
</p>
<p>
3. Trotter has just been standing on the coffee table to change a light bulb. We catch him at the precise moment of his triumph, settling back on his haunches in the blissful knowledge that he and his dog will be able to comfortably read all the books they please, when the sun goes down. Not for them the terrifying oblivion of Night.
</p>
<p>
4. Trotter fears you are plotting to take his money. Like a mother hen, he has flown screeching to the table and planted himself defensively atop his riches, ready to claw and peck your eyes out. In a few seconds he is going to seal the deal by urinating explosively.  
</p>
<p>
5. Trotter thinks the floor is lava.</p>
<p>
6. Tables are in danger of growing stale, and Trotter is taking them to strange new places. We are witnessing the birth of <em>tablepunk</em>. 
</p>
<p>
7. Due to a fluke mixture of personal deprivation and Walmart's hijacking of global timber supplies, this is literally the first time Trotter has ever encountered a coffee table, and the sheer audacity of the concept has scrambled his brain. He's absolutely tripping balls over here. His entire cognitive framework is rebooting before our eyes. His soul is molting like caterpillar.
</p>
<p>
It's been a long day, in case you couldn't tell, and I'm too exhausted by these intrigues to say anything further about Vivat Slovakia, which launches out of early access on 17th April. Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-no-longer-care-about-grand-theft-auto-6-for-i-have-the-open-world-of-vivat-slovakia">did a write-up last year</a> and was ambivalent, though he liked the radio stations.

<p>Blizzard has announced that Blizzcon 2025 won’t be happening. Instead, the event will make its return after a two-year hiatus in September 2026.</p>



<p>“We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005,” Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in its statement</a>. “Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>That event will take place from September 12-13 in Anaheim, California. Blizzard says that plans for next year are already in motion with events like the opening ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, and hands-on gameplay.</p>



<p>Blizzard says that the goal is to create an “unforgettable experience” for everyone who takes part in it, and they are working to “meaningfully elevate” the convention.</p>



<p>“We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure,” they said.</p>



<p>Since 202, Blizzcon has only been held twice: an online-only version in 2021 and a return to an in-person event in 2023. Blizzcon 2024 was cancelled in April 2024, with no official reason given. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzcon-2024-canceled-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s statement</a> at the time said that the decision was “not made lightly” and they planned on bringing it back in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of Blizzcon 2025 not happening and having to wait another year for the events return in 2026?

<p>ZA/UM Studio, the developers behind Disco Elysium, have announced their new game. Currently known as Project C4, this new game is an RPG that features a “mind-warping story of espionage and team-building in an original yet achingly familiar setting.”</p>



<p>A press release announcing the new game gives players more details on what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of [C4] is rife with shadowy characters who help move the pieces for competing geopolitical powers in a game of concealed conflict. The player sets out to complete a desperate assignment which will put them at risk of losing their life, or much worse – being exposed for what they really are.</p>



<p>As an Operant serving a questionable global power, the player finds themselves locked in a vicious, clandestine struggle for truth and influence. Yet it is the mind that takes centre stage in Project [C4]. More vulnerable and more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances amongst other means. Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can in order to survive the violent canvas of the real.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">short teaser trailer</a> for yourself below. More information on the game will be revealed at a later date.</p>

As it turns out, casting this character went a bit further, as director Hideo Kojima tried to find someone who could surpass a standout from the first Death Stranding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1899334415807070370" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Kojima wrote a lengthy post about the process of casting Italian actor Luca Marinelli to play Neil in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a>. "During the pandemic, I was casting for DS2," Kojima said. "Neil would be an important role that replaces Cliff from DS1. The fans would not be satisfied unless the casting would surpass Mads."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima first learned of Marinelli through his role in the Italian film They Call Me Jeeg, and a correspondence sprung up around the Japanese distribution of the film Martin Eden. Marinelli sent an email to Kojima, which read: "I grew up with Metal Gear. I am a big fan of yours. I am very honored that you saw the film I starred in. I wanted to tell you this directly."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 - Release Date Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After seeing Marinelli in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-old-guard">The Old Guard</a>, Kojima sent the actor an email offer and talked with him after the actor wrapped filming The Eight Mountains. Once pitched, Marinelli agreed and, after learning Kojima was looking for someone to play Lucy, introduced the game director to his wife Alissa Jung.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We did their scan and pcap [performance capture] during the height of the pandemic, but their on-set performance was excellent," Kojima said. "You can see that in the digitized results from even the small bits of the trailer. I can only thank Luca and Alissa for agreeing to perform when we didn't even have a script yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marinelli's character, Neil, has been one of the breakout reveals from the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer. At its conclusion, we see Neil don a bandanna in the same way Solid Snake would in Metal Gear Solid, before directing a squad of soldiers in the same manner as Cliff in the first Death Stranding.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The casting has clearly been on Kojima's mind for some time, as has the imagery of Luca donning the bandana. Back in 2020, Kojima talked about how Marinelli had caught his attention, adding: "I think if he donned a bandanna, he'd be a spitting image of Solid Snake!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's unlikely Neil is some multiversal Snake, the imagery certainly brings to mind Kojima's legacy with the Metal Gear franchise.

Even shapeshifting sorcerer Shang Tsung praises the T-1000’s abilities during one pre-match trash talk cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The highlight of the video is the look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which includes three references to Terminator 2. The first is the iconic finger point through the eyeball, the second the arm blade through the mouth, then the elevator door parting, except through the T-1000’s foe’s torso. Its animality sees the T-1000 transform into a K-9 German Shepherd, another reference to Terminator 2. In the film, John Connor's foster parents owned a German Shepherd named Max. The Terminator calls the dog Wolfie to trick the T-1000.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 in Mortal Kombat 1 is of course based on the liquid metal-based cybernetic assassin from the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day film, and features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on the T-1000 from NetherRealm: </p><blockquote>Battling for the supremacy of machines, the T-1000 is a state-of-the-art infiltration Terminator designed by artificial general superintelligence system Skynet. Comprised of mimetic polyalloy (a.k.a. liquid metal), the virtually indestructible advanced prototype can shapeshift into objects or people it comes in contact with, mimicking their appearance, behavior, and voice, making it an extremely difficult opponent to detect and defeat. With its superior intelligence and metamorphic capabilities, the T-1000 is an efficient fighter that embodies the ultimate evolution of assassination technology.</blockquote><blockquote>The T-1000’s sophisticated moveset is on full display in the new trailer, including the ability to organically form stabbing weapons, such as spears and hooks, and liquify for high-tech maneuvering and concealment. The video also reveals a new Fatality for the T-1000 and teases the character’s Animality, the brutal finishing move that morphs the machine into a K-9 German Shepherd to annihilate defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities are available now as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners at no additional cost.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 Terminator joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on March 18 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/11/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-kenshi-1741701745569.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 is packed with Terminator 2 references.

In the trailer we see her Fatal Blow, a move in which she batters her enemy’s face with her slipper. Madam Bo will be available as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns owners at no additional cost or via standalone purchase on March 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Mortal Kombat development chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Ed Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzcon-returns-september-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has announced the return of its BlizzCon gaming show, but there's a catch: the show isn't coming back until September 2026, which means it will have skipped two years in a row for the first time in its history.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Blizzard reveals that the convention will be returning to Anaheim, CA on September 12th and 13th next year. Naturally, tickets aren't on sale yet, but you can already sign up for updates via the <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Blizzard doesn't reveal what will be appearing at 2026's BlizzCon, but the studio does say the event is "one of [its] favorite traditions" and that it's planning to build the next BlizzCon "with a deep commitment to [its] players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=aNU0eqj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=Wlhf4HpD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard has announced BlizzCon's return...for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While no specifics are revealed, Blizzard does say you can expect the return of "BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more".</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a reveal for the next&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion that will constitute the second chapter of creative lead Chris Metzen's&nbsp;<em>Worldsoul Saga&nbsp;</em>trilogy, after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">2024's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">The War Within</a>&nbsp;</em>kicked things off in that regard.</p>

<p>Assuming it hasn't already been revealed, we may also get some more information about the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion, which Blizzard has already confirmed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard" rel="nofollow">won't be coming until 2026</a>, making BlizzCon the perfect place to reveal it.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't predict what else Blizzard will announce during the event, but I think those two guesses are safe bets. You can see the announcement trailer for BlizzCon 2026, which isn't particularly long or informative, here.</p>




<p>Given that tickets aren't yet on sale for BlizzCon 2026, we don't know much they'll cost, but you can probably expect to pay a few hundred dollars for the privilege of attending. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-new-katamari-damacy-game-in-almost-eight-years-announced-for-apple-arcade.1131321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple and Bandai Namco have announced that the first&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years is heading to Apple Arcade next month, along with five other new titles.</p>

<p><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is, as Apple puts it in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-arcade-launches-new-katamari-and-space-invaders-games-in-april/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, "the&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>franchise's first original game in nearly eight years", following the release of remasters&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Reroll&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</em>. It's launching on April 3rd.</p>

<p>Just like other&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>will see you taking control of the Prince as he completes a series of Katamari-based tasks given to him by the quirky King of All Cosmos. Apple says the series' core gameplay idea of "roll, stick, and grow" is intact in&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=uaOigroC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=vzc61j4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is the series' first original game in nearly eight years, and it's coming to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that while Apple and Bandai Namco haven't confirmed this,&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is unlikely to boast the involvement of original&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

<p>Having left Bandai Namco in 2010, Takahashi hasn't worked on a&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game since 2005's&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari</em>. Instead, he's hard at work on the rather&nbsp;<em>Katamari</em>-esque adventure game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator" rel="nofollow">launching in May</a>.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live</em>, Apple also announced five other games making their way to the Apple Arcade service. The first of these is Taito's&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders Infinity Gene Evolve</em>, an honest-to-goodness new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>It's joined by <i>Puffies</i>, a game by&nbsp;<em>Lumen&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stitch&nbsp;</em>developer Lykke Studios, as well as the Atari remaster&nbsp;<em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+</em>, which Apple says has been "enhanced for iPhone and iPad".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=7t9Rf0cY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=vdzcJ77u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+&nbsp;</em>is also on its way to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the new Apple Arcade collection are Marmalade Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>The Game of Life 2+&nbsp;</em>and STEM educational game&nbsp;<em>Sesame Street Mecha Builders+</em>, which, contrary to its name, probably isn't about Big Bird wrecking puppets with a giant mech.</p>

<p>All of these games join the Apple Arcade service, which is available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, on April 3rd.&nbsp;</p>

Presumably, in this story, the crown-wearing elephant is supposed to be the mascot for the store, but given she doesn’t speak (as the characters of <em>A Way Out </em>characters do) it’s hard to know for sure. The only way the players can interact with Cutie is if one of the game’s two heroes, Zoe, uses her gravity whip to pull pieces from her body, yoinking off say her leg or ear, and throwing them around.</p><p>If you’ve never played <em>It Takes Two</em>, this probably seems like a pretty innocuous scene. You can pick up and throw plenty of things in this portion of the game, so why would an elephant mascot be any different? However, if you’re a fan of <em>It Takes Two</em>, you know this is a reference to one of the most surprisingly horrific moments in a mostly family-friendly game.</p><p>In <em>It Takes Two</em>, an estranged married couple’s daughter casts a magic spell, transforming her mother and father into toys. The pair, the game’s two protagonists, are convinced that if they can make their daughter cry the spell will be broken. To do this, they make the decision to destroy one of her favorite toys, an elephant queen named Cutie. The game revels in how uncomfortable this scene is to play. Cutie’s adorable voice gives her an air of innocence: she’s nothing but sweet to her killers before she realizes what they’re planning to do, and then her pleas for her life are painful to listen to. She’s torn apart in the scrap, including losing the ear and leg you can yank off in <em>Split Fiction</em>, and it all ends with you cruelly dropping her off the side of a bookshelf.</p><p>The scene is infamous for its drastic tone shift, shockingly requiring you to straight-up torture this child’s toy, listening to it beg for its life throughout. So you can imagine how seeing Cutie again in <em>Split Fiction </em>might be retraumatizing to longtime players of Hazelight’s co-op games.</p><p>Thanks, Hazelight for the collective trauma, I guess? At least the rest of <em>Split Fiction </em>is great to make up for it.

Up to five times a day, any player that presses the “Thanks” button after a battle or a Wonder Pick will grant the recipient a shiny new Shop Ticket to use. Collect enough Shop Tickets, and you can exchange them for valuable Trainer Cards (Professor Oak is the GOAT), Accessories, and perhaps most importantly, stacks of Hourglasses every month.

Months into the mobile game’s existence, this community-driven initiative is still going as strong as ever based on my testing. If you’d like to give and receive thanks while spending the least effort possible, say hello to your newest lifehack (lifehack is still a thing people say, right?).</p><h2 id="h1604408"><a id=""></a><strong>How the Thanks channel works in Pokemon TCG Pocket</strong></h2><p>Truthfully, this couldn’t be easier to participate in. All you have to do is…</p><p><strong>1:</strong> Go to the “Battle” menu.</p><p><strong>2: </strong>Select “Versus.”</p><p><strong>3:</strong> Select “Private Match.”</p><p><strong>4: </strong>Enter the password “<strong>THANKS</strong>”. As far as I can tell, this isn’t case sensitive. “Thanks” or “thanks” should also work.</p><p><strong>5:</strong> Press “Battle!” You should be matched with an opponent after a short wait. You may need to sit in the queue for longer if you’re playing at off-hours (like late at night), though in my testing I’ve quickly found opponents at any time of day.</p><p><strong>6:</strong> <strong>Once the battle has started, concede immediately</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you or your opponent does this, but both of you will (hopefully) be on the same page.</p><p><strong>7:</strong> Click through the results, and <strong>make sure to press “Thanks!” for the battle once you see the prompt</strong>. Your opponent should do the same.</p><p>That’s the process in its entirety! Just repeat until you get all the Shop Tickets you need, and make sure you use any stocked up booster packs or Wonder Picks so you can complete your daily missions. Because this channel specifically exists to quickly trade thanks, you should have more luck here than if you just conceded a bunch of random matches. Congrats on gaming your daily grind!</p><p>Do note, however, that this is a community-driven trick that is subject to change depending on how the game is updated in the future. In other words, your mileage with the thanks channel may vary. On a similar note, it bears repeating that <strong>you should make sure you press “Thanks!” whenever you finish a match in this channel</strong>. No, you’re not going to get sent to jail if you forget to press the button once or twice, but repeatedly taking advantage of the community is, to quote my Kindergarten teacher, not a nice way to play with others. Also, stop putting Lego in your mouth.</p><h2 id="h1604409"><a id=""></a><strong>But won’t this ruin competitive battling?</strong></h2><p>Well, this trick has been around for several months now, and Random Matches are still abundantly easy to find, so no. Also, Ranked Battles will come to the game by the end of March, so competitive players almost certainly have nothing to worry about here.</p><hr><p>In fact, if you fancy yourself a competitive player, I still suggest fitting in Random Matches when you can, just to see what cards are dominating the landscape. After all, practice makes perfect, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">even if your Darkrai deck is still picking up wins left and right</a></span>. But if you’re about ready to go to sleep and don’t want to stare at your phone for another 45 minutes, then just enter into a Thanks battle and call it a day.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ultimate celebration of our games and the community that unites us is returning to the Anaheim Convention Center Saturday, September 12, and Sunday, September 13, in 2026.</p><p>One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together.</p><p>We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>BlizzCon will be back for 2026, Blizzard has announced, in the process confirming the convention will not happen this year. The developer's (usually) annual fan expo will return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September 2026 after having taken two years off.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas the vast majority of BlizzCons have happened in November, BlizzCon 2026 will instead happen two months earlier on September 12-13. In a press release announcing the date, Blizzard did not give more details or an explanation as to why the event is happening several months earlier than usual, nor why a 2025 event isn't happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've come a long way since our first event in 2005," Blizzard said in a press release. "Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It's important that we put on an event worthy of our community."</p><p dir="ltr">Many BlizzCon staples, like the announcement-heavy opening ceremony, in-depth panels about what's next for Blizzard's games, competitive tournaments, and more will be a part of the 2026 expo, Blizzard confirmed, additionally stating it aims to "elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not announced when tickets will go on sale but said to sign up on the official BlizzCon website to receive updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">Blizzard said it decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> It went on to say it was a decision it didn't make lightly as "BlizzCon remains a very special event for all of us, and we know many of you look forward to it." Blizzard at the time said it was "excited as ever" to bring back BlizzCon in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">While there was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/" data-ref-id="1100-6515587">BlizzCon 2023</a>, there wasn't one in 2022, with Blizzard instead opting for a digital-only presentation. Assuming BlizzCon 2026 does happen as planned, that will mean there will have only been two in-person BlizzCon events in the preceding five years.</p><p dir="ltr">In lieu of making major announcements at BlizzCon, Blizzard in 2024 instead revealed what's next for the Warcraft franchise during a 30th anniversary livestream (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing in World of Warcraft</a>) and announced new details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, as part of Summer Game Fest</a> and Gamescom 2024.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-coming-in-april.1131252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the main character of the iconic anime and manga into the world of the asymmetrical horror game.</p>

<p>The crossover arrives on April 2nd and will bring protagonist Ken Kaneki into&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, although unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date" rel="nofollow">main characters</a> from other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover" rel="nofollow">beloved IPs</a>, Kaneki won't be joining as a survivor but as a killer.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, Kaneki is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s first anime crossover in terms of playable characters, although Behaviour did team up with acclaimed horror writer Junji Ito for a cosmetic collection <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/junji-ito-collection-brings-his-chilling-creations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-gameplay.jpg?itok=pi3S6-hw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-gameplay.jpg?itok=Eu4pomiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>are crossing over.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect if you've read or watched&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, Kaneki will be using his Kagune tentacles to propel him around&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s maps and to both intimidate and attack survivors.</p>

<p>With each successful attack, Kaneki will enter Enraged Mode, which will amplify his "strength, brutality, and movements", according to Behaviour Interactive. It sounds like you'll need to stay on the offensive if you're playing as Kaneki.</p>

<p>The developer is also promising a set of perks "designed to apply pressure", as well as "gloriously graphic" effects when survivors succumb to Kaneki's Mori.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a set of "iconic looks and characters" from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s accompanying DLC collection, with various characters and outfits from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>making an appearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-kaneki-face.jpg?itok=xWCwGVDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-kaneki-face.jpg?itok=rtOaaap0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ken Kaneki looks pretty intimidating in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>joins a raft of other properties to get a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>crossover, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Remedy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky" rel="nofollow"><em>Child's Play&nbsp;</em>movies</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, more crossovers are planned for the future, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> due for sometime this summer. It's worth noting, too, that crossovers are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving" rel="nofollow">sometimes removed</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s roster, so if there's one you've got your eye on, make sure to snap it up quickly.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives on April 2nd, but you can check it out right now if you play on&nbsp;the game's public test server.</p>

            <p>
I'm not all that big on ranking games, truth be told - why would I want to catalogue a piece of art that way? But seeing as you have me at gunpoint (just pretend for me), I'll admit I'd probably put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a> in my top five. The platforming is tighter than any Mario entry, the art and soundtrack are stellar, and the story really hits home for me too.</p>
<p>You can imagine how excited I was when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, the follow-up from developer Extremely OK Games, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">announced</a>, and how upset I was when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-cancel-lush-platformer-earthblade-to-focus-on-smaller-scale-projects">cancelled a couple months back</a>. Still, we've been treated to a small taste of what the game might have been like in the form of a <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">mini-album with a select set of tracks from composer Lena Raine</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right off the bat you'll hear Raine's signature, synthy sound. Some tracks from the album are reminiscent of Celeste's score, while others feel completely fresh and unique. It definitely feels like it's going for a fantasy role-playing vibe - I’d love to know how this would have paired with the cancelled game’s action-platforming.
</p>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Raine explains over on the album's Bandcamp page that Earthblade "Across the Bounds of Fate" is more concept album than soundtrack. "The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste," she wrote. "I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can’t really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."
</p>
<p>
Apparently Raine took a lot of inspiration from older animation and film, like the "huge Yamaha synths" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> composer Vangelis, as well as the "weird textures and combination of old synths &amp; live strings of Joe Hisaishi’s score for Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," and the "haunting saxophone and percussive textures of Yoko Kanno’s work on Cowboy Bebop &amp; Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex." I think that Kanno influence can really be heard in particular on the sixth track, Poison in the Roots.
</p>
<p>
It's always quite gutting when a game gets cancelled, but I'm thankful to be able to hear a little bit of Earthblade's soundscape, especially given that 50% of the album's sales will be donated to <a href="https://translifeline.org/about/">Trans Lifeline</a>. Get on it!

But what if Aloy was also controlled by an AI program and could patiently chat with you during her adventures, answering all of your inane questions like “where can I find salmon bones to upgrade my pouches?” That’s the type of thing Sony appears to be experimenting with in a recently leaked GPT demo that teases one of the more horrifying possibilities for gaming’s future. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

It was run on PC but apparently can work on PS5 as well.</p><p>Sony’s own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system is apparently used to generate Aloy’s voice responses, and its Mockingbird technology is used to crudely animate her lips.

As far as a rough tech demo goes, however, it’s both silly and deeply chilling. “This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” Raghoebardajal said during the video which has since been removed by a copyright strike company representing Sony. </p><p>Sony’s experiment has already drawn heavy criticism from some fans and game developers on social media. “I was lead to feel very confident that Sony wouldn’t do anything like this lol,” wrote Alanah Pearce, who previously worked on narrative at Sony Santa Monica. “Finally saw the Aloy NPC and I have so many issues with it I don’t know where to start,” wrote ‪Anna Megill‬, a writer on the follow-up to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at CD Projekt Red. “I’d rather speak to the heap of twisted limbs that Miyazaki called an insult to life itself.”</p><p>Companies have been exploring generative AI and large  language model (LLM) applications in gaming for years now.

It feels like we’re still a long way from those technologies dramatically upending gaming and everything else, as some of their biggest advocates claim they will, but it’s also not hard to see how that could happen at some point and how much that might suck.</p><p>Many video game performers, including Ashly Burch who voices Aloy in the <em>Horizon </em>games, have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra-troy-baker-ai-cod-mw-3-1851604153&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra-troy-baker-ai-cod-mw-3-1851604153">on strike for better AI protections</a></span> for over a year now. The fear is that companies will steamroll talent with bad contracts that let them do whatever they want with the performances captured, including feeding them into algorithms to fuel additional AI-generated performances for free. Actors would not only lose out on pay but creative control over which of their performances are used and how. </p><p>It can seem like a theoretical fear until you watch something like Sony’s own experimentation with an Aloy chatbot. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which, instead of a robotic Aloy fumbling her lips to answer basic questions about the game, it’s a near-perfectly-animated character ad-libbing responses in a voice indistinguishable from Burch’s. Instead of being an avatar for an authored story by other people, Aloy simply becomes another vessel keeping players engaged through endlessly convincing but completely empty conversations. </p><p>In that version of gaming’s future, the ultimately compelling version of the character is one aimed exclusively at boosting PlayStation player metrics like daily active users and session length. It might not be the type of game that wins awards but it could be the one, like algorithmic feeds on Instagram and TikTok, that keeps people endlessly logged on. You know, a kernel of the entire thing that went haywire and ruined the planet in the <em>Horizon</em> games, and which Aloy has spent hundreds of hours fighting to fix. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>REPO has exploded onto the scene with its combination of fear-inducing enemies and uncomfortable environments. Its synergy with slapstick comedy and multiplayer chaos is the tip of the iceberg. PC players are enjoying it, but PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch owners are wondering about extra REPO platforms and if it’s on consoles too.</p>



<p>Many breakout hits are traditionally indie titles on PC through Steam. I think of recent hits such as Lethal Company and Content Warning. REPO is following in their footsteps with its brand of valuable-collecting shenanigans. It doesn’t matter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many players you play with in REPO</a>, a good (but cursed) time is assured.</p>



<p>Its Steam player numbers have been extraordinary since launch, but can it also be enjoyed on consoles?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-ps5">Is REPO on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More money needed. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO is not currently available on PlayStation 5 or even PlayStation 4.</strong></p>



<p>Developer semiwork’s only previous project was Voidigo—a colorful roguelite. As such, the company is still very much in the process of building its brand. A <a href="https://repogame.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> PS5 port is presumably dependent on the horror game’s long-term success. The more people buy it, the more people play it on Steam, the chances of a PlayStation port increase.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-xbox">Is REPO on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox also doesn’t have a REPO port lined up for the same reasons as other popular consoles.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, Microsoft owners face the same problem as PlayStation owners. REPO is very much an indie game, and Steam is a great proving ground for the title. Costs increase once you start factoring in more platforms and ports—let alone to mammoth brands such as PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-nintendo-switch">Is REPO on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch also misses out on a REPO console release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve seen what I’ve had to say about REPO on PlayStation and Xbox already, the penny has dropped for Nintendo Switch owners too. The Switch is a very receptive platform for indie games, so a REPO release might not be unthinkable.</p>



<p>If the status of REPO’s platforms changes on PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, we’ll update this guide and let you know.</p>



<hr>



<p>REPO is the epitome of an overnight sensation that continues to grow. The sky is the limit as it stands, and people are loving REPO as it stands. let us know what you think, and share any funny stories you’ve had with it.</p>



<p>Keep up with the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-repo-down-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO server status</a> changes as the player figures potentially meddle with the connection.</p>

Sony was heavily involved in the development of the first game--and assisted Kojima Productions in completing the reveal trailer through its PlayStation Studios Visual Arts group--but given the company's recent approach to porting more of its console-exclusives to PC in the years since Death Stranding launched, it's highly likely that Death Stranding 2 will make its way to that platform eventually.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_Story">Death Stranding 2 Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Kojima is keeping the Death Stranding 2 story under wraps for now, but he has revealed a few details about the game since its official debut, while the first trailer has also hinted at a new calamity on the horizon as the unstoppable Death Stranding continues. The story for Death Stranding 2 that Kojima originally had in mind was thrown out after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, with Kojima remarking that he restarted from square one. "I had the story written before the pandemic. But after experiencing the pandemic, I just rewrote the whole story from scratch," Kojima said at the Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"Should we have connected" is the main crux of the story, as following Sam's journey to help establish the United Cities of America, the world has changed. Deliveries are now automated, a dangerous new cult seems to have emerged, and Higgs Monoghan has somehow managed to escape the Beach after he was stranded on it toward the end of the first game. Throw in a hulking samurai outfitted in red armor, kaiju-sized tar-monsters, and new locales, and Death Stranding 2 looks like it'll be greatly expanding on the ideas of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, embark on an inspiring mission of human connection beyond the UCA," the official plot synopsis from Kojima Productions reads. "Sam--with companions by his side--sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles, and a haunting question: should we have connected?"</p><p dir="ltr">If you sift through the reveal trailer, there's a whole bunch of fascinating threads to explore, ranging from the state of the world after more connections had been made, the return of Fragile, who is in a much healthier state now, and possibly a multiverse of variants to deal with.

This time, Reedus will be joined by a few new faces as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elle-fanning-thinks-death-stranding-2-looks-pretty-amazing-but-is-going-to-get-so-much-better/1100-6511370/"> Elle Fanning</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-game-features-deadpool-2-actress/1100-6508796/"> Shioli Kutsuna</a> are in the cast. Reedus once again plays Sam Porter Bridges, and he's joined by Lea Seydoux (Fragile) and Troy Baker (Higgs Monaghan), two characters from the first Death Stranding.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new actors include Mad Max director George Miller as Tarman, the captain of the DHV Magellan and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-latest-footage-debuts-new-characters-and-a-talking-doll/1100-6526788/"> Fatih Akin as Dollman</a>, one of the more interesting additions to the series. True to his name, Dollman is a living puppet who'll join Sam on his journey, and who isn't afraid to pick a fight with people like Higgs. Speaking of Higgs, the self-proclaimed particle in all things is sporting a wild new look, resembling a cyberpunk version of the Crow. There's also Neil, another new character who is the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/"> spitting image of Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series</a> when he dons a bandana, as seen in the release date trailer.

dir="ltr" id="Death_Stranding_2_gameplay">Death Stranding 2 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">The first Death Stranding was essentially a puzzle game, as players had to guide Sam to his destination and figure out the best route and equipment to help him deliver his cargo in one piece. Sure, the game also had action and stealth as you were forced into fights with package-stealing Mules and the ghostly BTs haunting parts of the map, but the real core of the game was focused on the journey and the destination ahead of you. Adding an extra wrinkle to the gameplay was timefall, a weather phenomenon involving deadly rain that could steal the time of anything it landed on before becoming harmless water, and staying outside too long during one of these showers could ruin a cargo run.</p><p dir="ltr">For Death Stranding 2, it looks like that mix of genres has been expanded on. Couriering cargo, for example, looks even more dangerous thanks to other weather phenomena like bushfires, lightning storms, and avalanches. To make things easier, it looks like Sam will have access to a new fleet of vehicles that can traverse this deadly ground, as well as exoskeletons and floating carriers.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also looks like it has been beefed up, especially with all of the new enemies that you'll encounter. Human foes seem to be smarter this time. we've glimpsed horrifying hand-monsters in the wild, and we're going to need a much bigger gun to take on the skyscraper-sized tar-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Asynchronous multiplayer will also return in the sequel via the Social Strand system, which helped foster a feeling of connection in Death Stranding. Essentially, this allowed players to have an impact on the world, leaving behind useful tools, gadgets, and vehicles for other players to find in their expeditions once certain areas had been connected to the Chyral Network. We're not certain if or how this system has been expanded, but if it's anything like the one seen in the first game, it'll be a welcome feature as players lend a hand to each other in a dangerous world.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_soundtrack">Death Stranding 2 soundtrack</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSN1rPPKK9s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSN1rPPKK9s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding's soundtrack is a highlight of that game, as chill beats to relax to at the end of the world made for a meditative experience. We know that Woodkid composed the song "The Wilder" which was heard in the SXSW trailer and that you can listen to in the video above. This isn't the first time that the French music video director has worked with Kojima, as he previously teamed up with the director to create the song "Goliath" for the Death Stranding: Director's Cut trailer. Beyond that,<a href="https://youtu.be/krSy6fI0SBU?t=2038" rel="nofollow "> Woodkid also has several other tracks</a> that'll be in Death Stranding 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Scottish music trio Chvrches also contributed some of the best tracks to the game, and while they haven't been formally contacted to create some new material for the sequel, the band says that it'll be ready in a hot second if Kojima approaches them again.</p><p>"There's nothing formal yet. We’ve talked [and] we've hinted heavily at each other that we would both like to collaborate again," Chvrches synth player Martin Doherty<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chvrches-talks-death-stranding-2-is-ready-to-return-if-kojima-calls/1100-6512094/">said in March</a>. "There's sort of a dance going on right now. I don't want to be rejected by all out saying, 'Can we be on the game please?' and [Kojima] says no. But I don’t know. We're continuing to build a really special relationship with Hideo. And I think we get him and I think he gets us. If the call comes in to do more then of course, we'll be there in a second."</p>

Each mouse pad was built with a different material and offers a unique texture. The QcK Performance Series is out now and available to order directly from SteelSeries.</p><p dir="ltr">We had the opportunity to test the new mouse pads and can attest that each one feels distinct from the other, but all three offer a premium feel. SteelSeries is offering two different sizes for each variant: Large for $40 and XL for $50. The Large is 19.3 x 16.5 inches, which means it offers substantially more space than the average mouse pad while still mainly intended as a surface for mouse movement. If you want a full desk mat with enough room for your keyboard and other accessories, the XL is the way to go since it measures in at 35.4 x 15.75 inches.</p><p dir="ltr">All mouse pads in the QcK Performance Series have 3.5mm non-slip neoprene foam bases and low-profile stitched edges. We've broken down all three QcK Performance surface types below and included comparison images of the two different sizes. </p><div title="6530026 - SteelSeries QcK Performance mousepads" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3243" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530026 - SteelSeries QcK Performance mousepads" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/steelseries.com\/gaming-mousepads\/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control">QcK Performance Control Mouse Pad</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/steelseries.com\/gaming-mousepads\/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control">Large - $40 | XL - $50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Control surface used a micro-beaded texture to increase friction, which enables more precise movements and better stopping ability.
