            <p>Hello. My name is Julian Benson and, as you will have gathered from the headline, I am the new Editorial Director of Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While this is my announcement post, in truth, I've already been here a couple of weeks. However, I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself as I worked through the treehouse, mapping out its dimensions on gridpaper.* I have had some successes in puzzling out the workings of this ancient structure – for instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-only-more-games-ended-like-hardspace-shipbreaker">finding out how articles are posted</a>. Though, there are many rooms still to uncover, so I may remain in the background a little as I get situated. The bashing of furniture and snarls coming from behind the door marked  'Comment Moderation' suggest I should leave that one till last. But I did want to put my head above the treehouse's parapet – the crenellations are an architectural nod to its earlier days as RPS Towers and Castle RPS – and let you know who I am and why I'm here.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, when I was still working as a volunteer for long-departed gaming site Beefjack (alongside James, coincidentally), I reached out to Jim to pitch an article about transcribing games into musical notation. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/music-to-my-thumbs-transcribing-braid">The resulting article</a> was more ambitious than my writing ability could sustain, but I'll never forget the depth with which RPS's commenters engaged with and challenged my ideas. In all the years since, it was a level of discussion I've rarely seen at the other sites I've written for. Still, it would be more than a decade before I could return to RPS's pages outside of the Sunday Papers.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, I've worked for sites such as TechRadar Gaming, GAMINGbible, and Kotaku UK, as well as RPS's other other fanzine, PCGamesN. It was only when I returned to freelance in 2023, appearing in Edge, The Guardian, and GQ, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/julian-benson">I could once again write on RPS</a>. Even a decade later, it still carries the thrill of that first feature.</p><p>As long as I've been writing about videogames I've been reading RPS, and there is no publication that has had a greater impact on how I talk about games and see their role in our lives. Part of the magic of this site is that it is a place where writers and readers will afford a game equal attention, whether it was made by a single developer or built by thousands. It is a magic conjured by a team of passionate writers, and equally passionate readers, who care about games and how they fit into culture – which is to say, alongside other artforms, neither above nor below them. So when the opportunity to join the team arose, I seized it.</p>
<p>That RPS is a space where this discussion can take place is only because of the hard work of the many members of the team who came before, a line stretching back to the site’s founders. Though I want to acknowledge in particular the size of the shoes Graham has left behind. Each of his boots are big enough to comfortably fit a Clarks outlet in the toe and a Doc Martens warehouse in the heel. Over 12 years, he and the team established and maintained the direction and voice of RPS, making it into the place I have the opportunity to lead today. The footsteps he and the others left are clear and I'm going to try my best to follow them and keep them in sight whenever we strike out into the new.</p>
<p>In the months since Graham's departure, the team has done an excellent job of running RPS. Selfishly, their capability makes my job of proving I can be of some use much harder. Now that I'm here I can't wait to lend a hand wherever I can.</p>
<p>I find the title of 'Editorial Director' to be uncomfortably grand, but it does capture my responsibility: I will be working hard to support this talented team do their best work, and for you, the readers, I will be the point of contact when you want to discuss the direction of the site. I'm not on social media but you can email me or reach out through the comments whenever you need.</p><p>To give you a sense of our current plans, at the moment we are hard at work putting together all the pieces that will see out the end of 2025: Advent Calendars, Selection Boxes, and larger pieces, such as this year's RPS 100, which has seen some significant upsets in the voting since last year's edition – my love of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-must-die">Orcs Must Die!</a> will not be denied. And we will also be asking for your opinion, too, with a return of the RPS 100: Reader's Edition, which we plan to run through December.</p>
<p>We will have other announcements to make in 2026, I just need to find a way to get Graham's massive shoes out of my office so I can reach the desk…</p>
<p>So for now, I will say 'Hello! I am thrilled to be here'.</p>
<p>*I also used the time honing my Horace-drawing abilities. You can tell me if that time was spent fruitfully.</p>

<p>A new season is deploying in Marvel Rivals with the launch of Season 5, which naturally comes alongside a fresh balance patch with buffs and nerfs, and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals features all the tweaks we’ve come to expect with the seasonal transition of the title, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-team-up-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake-up to Team-Up Abilities</a>, and tweaks are made to specific heroes to ensure they all remain viable.</p>



<p>For a breakdown of all the buffs and nerfs present in Marvel Rivals for the Season 5 launch, we’ve got all the information you need.</p>

<p><strong>Season 5 sees potentially the biggest balance changes of all, and remarkably, there’s not a single nerf at launch. Instead, a host of characters are receiving buffs.</strong></p>



<p>For Vanguards, stand-out changes include Peni Parker’s Cuber-Webs now providing the same Healing Over Time and Movement Boost to ally players as she receives, while Magneto’s Metal Bulwark and Iron Bulwark have had their cooldowns seperated, although the shield value is reduced from 250 to 200.</p>



<p>In the DPS scene, Mister Fantastic’s Bonus Health has been tweaked to provide an addition of 350 Maximum Health and a one-time heal of 350, which is removed upon exiting his inflated state, while Squirrel Girl’s Burst Acorn damage has been increased to 110 from 100.</p>



<p>Finally, two Strategists have seen their base health increased, with Cloak &amp; Dagger and Loki receiving the boost, while Invisible Woman can now deploy a shield in front of her.</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of all the characters affected with buffs and nerfs in Season 5.</p>

            <p>Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has commented on Valve's freshly announced hardware, stating "gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, the exec praised "open platforms" for this forward momentum. "Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start," <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496">Spencer said</a>.</p>

<p>Rounding out his thoughts and congratulating Valve on its hardware announcements, Spencer closed: "As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere."</p>
<p>Elsewhere on social media, a fellow Xbox employee in the form of senior social media manager Josh Stein remarked that Valve's new hardware looked kind of like the "rumoured" Xbox Series S designs from back in 2019.</p>
<p>"All hail the cube," <a href="https://x.com/steinekin/status/1988671218099339775">Stein joked</a>.</p>

<p>While this may be quite a humorous coincidence, Valve has said the announcement of its Steam Machine stemmed from the company's own PC gaming experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Valve's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trio of hardware announcements</a> (the Steam Machine, the Steam Frame, and the Steam Controller), the biggest question users were left with was pricing. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to IGN</a>, Valve's Hardware Engineer Yazan Aldehayyat did not shy from sharing a few things about the pricing of the Steam Machine, stating that it will be very competitive with building a PC with similar hardware. </p>



<p><em>If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it. The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible.</em></p>



<p>Let's take another look at the specifications, then.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Valve claims it arrived at these hardware specifications after carefully analyzing the Steam hardware survey, with the goal of enabling 4K@60Hz performance in all Steam games (through upscaling). However, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rv83LgXiN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> that in their early test at Valve, Cyberpunk 2077 ran at 1440p@60FPS upscaled to 4K, but dropped to 30 frames per second as soon as they enabled ray traced reflections and sun shadows. The folks at DF estimate the performance of the Steam Machine to be positioned somewhere between an Xbox Series S and a PlayStation 5, possibly closer to the latter.</p>



<p>The Xbox Series S is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at $379.99</a> (in its 512GB model), while the PlayStation 5 (digital edition) <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">costs $499.99</a>. Both consoles received price hikes this year, mainly due to the tariffs. Still, if Valve really wants to break into the living room this time around, it needs to be competitive with them, not just with a PC, which is notoriously more expensive. At the very least, it should cost less than the PlayStation 5 Pro (currently priced at $749.99), being far less powerful on paper. </p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is set to switch over into a new season with the launch of Season 5, with two new characters joining the battlefield, and the roadmap for the season has revealed when Rogue will be playable.</p>



<p>Rogue is one of two new additions to the Marvel Rivals character roster in Season 5, alongside her partner, Gambit. However, while Remy LeBeau will be available from the start of Season 5 on November 14, players will have to wait a little bit longer for Rogue’s arrival.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Lots to come. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>NetEase has shared an <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1988683430242943375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official roadmap</a> for the content coming in Season 5, which reveals the release date for several new costumes, the start of the Anniversary Event, where players can earn up to $25 worth of currency for free, and the launch of the 18-vs-18 Conquest Annihilation game mode.</p>



<p>However, the biggest news of all confirms just how long the first half of the season will last, as it’s revealed that Season 5.5 will begin on December 12.</p>



<p>We don’t yet know all of the content that will be launching at the start of Season 5.5, but we do know the mid-point in the season will mark the arrival of Rogue.</p>







<p>Given the time of the year Season 5.5 launches, it’s expected that a Holiday Event to cover Christmas and the New Year will be on the cards at some point, while Season 6 will launch in January 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year-and-its-early-reception-has-been-great.1352185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, South Korean developer NCSOFT (Lineage, Aion, Throne and Liberty) took the stage at G-Star 2025 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce</a> the long-rumored Horizon Steel Frontiers MMORPG. The game, which is targeting a launch on PC and mobile, is a collaboration between the studio and franchise holder Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>The announcement provided a few initial and fairly vague details, such as the region (the Deadlands, modeled after Arizona and New Mexico) the game will take place in, the fact that players will cooperate to take down machines but also compete for resources and fight against rival tribes, and the tweaks made to the combat system. The developers claim there will be new mechanics, such as climbing onto a damaged machine part with the Pullcaster to set traps and inflict status effects, picking up weapons dropped during battle, carrying them on your mount, and using them at a later time. Perhaps the biggest difference shown in the debut Horizon Steel Frontiers gameplay, though, is the addition of greatswords. Whereas Aloy only ever used a spear for melee while heavily favoring bows, it looks like this game will allow proper melee combat with parries and counterattacks.</p>



<p>What neither the announcement video nor the official press release mentioned was any launch window. However, NCSOFT executives spoke about it two days ago during the company's <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/ncsoft/ncsoft.php?c=ncsoft&amp;y=3230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 2025 earnings call</a>. They were confident that it could launch in 2026 or early 2027 and also boasted of having received acclaim from those who had already played it.</p>



<p><em>Internally, the development has progressed pretty significantly, so we think that based on the development progress, it would be available to be launched either next year or early two years from now, but we need to discuss the specifics with the IP holder. What I want to emphasize is that significant progress has been made in development, so with refinement, we will be able to release this title, too. Everyone gave us a round of applause after viewing the demonstration and playing the game firsthand.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, with game development becoming increasingly complex, especially for an MMORPG, I would say there's a solid chance we'll see it in 2027. Still, that NCSOFT thinks it could launch as early as next year suggests we could at least be able to try the game in pre-release testing events throughout 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Three years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first rumors on the project</a>, NCSOFT has now unveiled Horizon Steel Frontiers at G-Star 2025. This is a full-fledged MMORPG for PC (via the South Korean studio's PURPLE platform) and mobile (iOS and Android) based on Guerrilla Games' popular action/adventure franchise.</p>



<p>The announcement video features comments from Jan-Bart van Beek, now Studio Head at the Dutch developer, and also the person who came up with the original concept of Horizon. Van Beek says this is a version of the world that's meant to be played 'anywhere and at any time' (on mobile devices), and adds that Guerrilla was able to playtest the game and feels amazing about it, as it sports a unique identity that also fits with the universe. The Guerrilla Games Studio Head also seemed to hint that there will be PvP in addition to PvE:</p>



<p><em>You're sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources. That mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script. At the heart of Horizon's story is the search for the balance between humanity, nature, and technology. And sometimes that's harmony, sometimes that's conflict, but it always creates a world filled with mystery and beauty.</em></p>

<iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Announcement Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN-NNgWIyIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the video, Sung-gu Lee, the Executive Producer of Horizon Steel Frontiers at NCSOFT, talked about tweaking the franchise's signature combat for an MMORPG:</p>



<p><em>Our main focus is designing a new combat experience tailored for an MMORPG. In Horizon Steel Frontiers, we’ve added unique, original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines. For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine, you can quickly approach and climb onto it using a Pullcaster, set traps on the damaged part, and inflict status effects. During battle, you can even pick up weapons dropped by the machine, carry them on your mount, and use them in subsequent fights.</em></p>



<p><em>At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values: cooperation and strategy. Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly. These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide.</em></p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers will take place in a new area of the post-apocalyptic United States, known as the Deadlands, which is inspired by the landscapes of New Mexico and Arizona.</p>



<p>More details will undoubtedly follow. Meanwhile, you can find the official website <a href="https://hsf.plaync.com/en-us/conts/teaser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this URL</a>.</p>

<p>The free-to-play MOBA <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_unite">Pokémon Unite</a> has experienced all sorts of updates since arriving on the Switch eShop and mobile devices in 2021, but this latest announcement appears to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnite/comments/1ovrgay/aeos_coins_are_gone/">a lot of the community talking</a> about the title's future.</p>
<p>In an in-game notification, it's been revealed as of <strong>4th December 2025</strong>, Aeos coins will no longer be distributed. Nintendo Life can confirm the following in-game message. Here's the part of this notice focused on Aeos coins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of <strong>December 4, 2025</strong>, Aeos coins will no longer be distributed, and the Unite Battle Comittee will no longer offer Unite licenses in exchange for Aeos coins. If you would like to obtain Unite licenses via Aeos coins, please do so by that date.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fosrkzq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Aeos coin boost cards will become unusable starting December 4, 2025. We plan to allow remaining ones to be exchangeable for Aeos coins. This will be implemented at a later date.</p>
<p>After December 4, 2025, the Unite Battle Committee will, however, continue to offer Unite licenses in exchange for Aeos gems.</p>
<p>Aeos Coin Exchange</p>
<p>An Aeos Coin Exchange will become available December 4, 2025. Here, players will be able to exchange previously earned Aeos coins for license points or various items.</p>
<p>Aeos coins and the Aeos Coin Exchange will remain in-game <strong>until May 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>This discontinuation of Aeos coins will take place alongside the introduction of License Journeys on the same date (4th December 2025). These will give players a new way to obtain Licenses in Unite by playing the game and accumulating License points. These can be obtained as battle pass rewards, from random boxes, or as rewards from future events. Here's a bit more about this new feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Typically, each time the player selects a Unite license to work toward, they'll choose from five available licenses. However, there will also be times players can choose from all the Unite licenses in the game. Unite licenses for newly released Pokémon may also become available via License Journeys at the same time they're released in the shop."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2025 marks the fourth anniversary of Pokémon Unite. Over the years it's been expanded with new playable Pokémon, maps, modes and much more, and is also playable on the Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/several-tier-1-counter-strike-events-not-happening/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98several%E2%80%99-tier-1-counter-strike-2-events-won%E2%80%99t-happen-in-2026-it%E2%80%99s-confirmed.1352164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent post on social media, the CEO of PGL, Silviu Stroie, confirmed that ‘several’ high-tier Counter-Strike 2 tournaments won’t take place in 2026. This is because an announcement pathway wasn’t followed, which unfortunately violates Valve’s tournament operation requirements.</p>



<p>The post on social media confirmed that <strong>none of the Starladder events </strong>in 2026 will take place, and two of the three Fissure events in 2026 have also been struck from the schedule.</p>







<h2 id="h-cs2-events-slashed-from-the-schedule">CS2 Events Slashed From the Schedule</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1988490449951015313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The post</a> from Silviu Stroie, CEO of PGL, reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Several CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 won’t take place, as they missed the deadline for announcing the additional details. None of the Starladder CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 will take place. The same applies to two of the three Fissure CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 (Playground 4 and Playground 5). So far, there has been no Starladder announcement for any Tier 1 event in 2027.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one of the most important comments under the post, a user wrote, ‘How can this happen? Like, if you know that this is a requirement, there’s like a 0% chance of missing the deadline if it’s your main business.’</p>



<p>Valve’s tournament operation requirements demand that organizers provide ‘additional information’ within a certain timeframe after an initial announcement. That deadline was missed by some, and therefore, these tournaments will not be allowed to go ahead.</p>







<p>Neither of the organizers impacted by this confirmation have provided a statement to say what’s happening, but Stroie also mentioned that no Starladder events have been announced (at Tier 1) going into 2027, which is cryptic to say the least. This was later refuted by Starladder, as the company revealed that ‘the next Tier-1 Starladder event comes in October 2027’.</p>



<p>Are you bothered about the loss of these events, or do you feel that there are already enough Counter-Strike tournaments lined up? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, Escape from Tarkov hits a 1.0 state after a <strong>decade </strong>in testing and development. It’s a monumental time to be a fan of the spearhead extraction shooter, and the release comes as the genre is experiencing something of a boom, spurred onwards by the recent arrival of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that Escape from Tarkov will have a new Twitch Drops campaign that’s kicking off to celebrate the launch of the game on November 15, this coming Saturday.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-twitch-drops-coming">Tarkov Twitch Drops Coming</h2>



<p>From November 15 to December 6, Tarkov fans will be able to watch their favorite streamers exploring the new 1.0 update that brings the game into an entirely new world. The drops will reward players with different reward crates, containing some loot that could be considered highly exclusive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hideout Targets</li>



<li>Tarko Figuring</li>



<li>Nikita’s PMC Voice</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a split between the rewards coming to the Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops campaign, and that’s between <strong>free </strong>and <strong>paid-for </strong>rewards. If you dish out subscriptions during the event, you’ll unlock even more content in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Subs – Cap, M-2 Brown &amp; Secure Container</li>



<li>3 Subs – PMC Dogtag (Twitch)</li>



<li>1 Sub – Hideout Decor</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was stressed</a> that the split is timed differently, too. The free drops run until November 28, while the paid rewards will stay live until December 6.</p>







<p>More content will be added, per a graphic published by Battlestate Games, so expect plenty of rewards to flow going into Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release – provided you watch those streaming the game. The 1.0 update is highly anticipated and will bring a new map, story, and many other quality-of-life improvements and upgrades.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/north-line-update-release-time-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-north-line-update-release-time%E2%80%94stella-montis-unlock.1352155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a new supersized update inbound called North Line, and it introduces a new map, new ARC enemies, weapons, quests, and more. It will be made accessible via a community event that requires all users to contribute to a project to bust open a tunnel leading to the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>Many are wondering when the North Line update will be released. It’s coming out today, but the release time for the update isn’t clear. Read on to learn what we know about the ARC Raiders North Line update release times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-north-line-releasing-on-arc-raiders">When is North Line Releasing on ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The North Line update for ARC Raiders will be released today, November 13, at 09:30 AM GMT / 04:30 AM ET / 01:30 AM PT.</strong> This timing convention is to allow for a unified launch of the update across all platforms and territories.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter will be able to enjoy some of the trappings of the North Line update when it drops, but the bulk of it will come after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">the Breaking New Ground event</a> has been completed.</p>



<p>This is where players must contribute Metal Parts, Fabric, Chemicals, Plastic Parts, and Rubber Parts to the centralized project to open up the tunnels to Stella Montis. Here, players will be able to explore a new path in ‘Staking Our Claim’, digging deep into Stella Montis, facing new ARC threats, and preparing for the <strong>next </strong>major ARC Raiders update – Cold Snap.</p>







<p>There’s a busy roadmap ahead, and Embark Studios has promised to support ARC Raiders for the next decade, so expect plenty more maps, modes, weapons, and more to be added in the coming months to make way for that lifecycle.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally being ‘released’ this week after a decade in alpha and beta stages. It brings an end to years of development that have culminated in Escape from Tarkov being the most popular extraction shooter ever made. It’s a paradigm shift of a title that’s evolving into a 1.0 state this coming Saturday.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, suggested that a drastic balancing mechanic might be put into play for Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform.</p>







<h2 id="h-they-might-wipe-the-pve-flea-market">They Might Wipe the PvE Flea Market</h2>



<p>Nikita suggested in a recent interview with Pestily that the team at Battlestate Games might wipe the Flea Market <strong>specifically on the PvE platform </strong>when 1.0 drops. Pestily addressed the Flea Market being ‘filled with stuff’ that PvE players have collected over many months, impacting the mode’s economy.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We will see. Maybe we will wipe the Flea Market, for example.</p>



<p>Nobody said that we can’t do that. We can wipe the Flea Market, and nobody will say anything to us, because the Flea Market is just a sub-system that we can wipe.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I laughed out loud at this clip <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nikgeneburn</a>.  Glad you are keeping your humor!</p><p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Pestily?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pestily</a>'s interview today, Nikita says they might wipe the flea for PvE to keep people from snowballing with 1.0…</p><p>BUT…. if this is all you guys have planned It's not enough, you are going to… <a href="https://t.co/VZCegXIYsE">pic.twitter.com/VZCegXIYsE</a></p></div>— Airwingmarine (@Airwingmarine1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Airwingmarine1/status/1988718220728234146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p><br>Escape from Tarkov players focused on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-players-need-to-wipe-for-full-release-quest/">PvE will need to wipe their accounts</a> to access the new story being introduced with 1.0. This story will finally allow players to <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, presenting them with a branching campaign with multiple endings.</p>



<p>This is bad news for the PvE players (like myself) who have spent the last year racking up a phenomenal stash and building the strongest character they’ve ever made, simply because PvE <strong>doesn’t automatically wipe</strong>.</p>







<p>The economy that has been created because of that is a little skewed, so pushing for a reset of this kind might be a neat balancing tactic.</p>



<p>Do you think that Battlestate Games should better balance the PvE platform? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-13">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 13)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #886:</p>



<ul>
<li>FIRE EXTINGUISHER</li>



<li>AIR PURIFIER</li>

<li>SHAVING CREAM</li>



<li>GETUP</li>

</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>

That's not all, though! If you only watched the trailer and didn't actually catch the Nintendo Direct, you might have missed two other scenes.</p>
<p>During the short presentation by Shigeru Miyamoto, Illumination's Chris Meledandri (and the voice of Bowser, Jack Black), Mario fans got a teaser of a Rosalina and Bowser Jr. scenes. In the main trailer, Rosalina doesn't speak, so this is technically the first scene we've seen of her talking.</p>
<p>The cosmic protector will be voiced by the "academy award winner and Nintendo super fan" Brie Larson. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/12-details-you-might-have-missed-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">we noted in our recent feature</a>, this scene gives us a brief look at some Luma (including a little one with a dummy) listening to Rosalina's story as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a>-style storybook scene. Here it is in full:</p>

<p>Next up, we've got a look at Bowser Jr. - the new villain in the Mario Galaxy Movie, voiced by Benny Safdie. This "uncut gem" (Jack Black's words) co-directed the award-winning crime-thriller Uncut Gems, and can be seen as Bowser's son in this first look, plotting his family's rise from the ashes.</p>

<p>So, there you go - a little more footage to enjoy until the next update or trailer drop. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will arrive in theatres in <strong>April 2026</strong>. You can find out more about everything in the main trailer as well as our feature and guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-ps5-trailer-2000643663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reveals-secret-horizon-mmo-that-looks-like-monster-hunter-but-isn%E2%80%99t-coming-to-ps5.1352122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has officially revealed the long-rumored <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-open-world-7th-anniversary-1851293448"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> MMO spin-off</a> it’s making with <em>Guild Wars</em> publisher NCSoft. It’s called <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, it looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and it’s not coming to PlayStation 5.</p>

 <p>Announced during South Korea’s G-Star gaming convention, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> was developed in partnership with PlayStation studio Guerrilla Games and centers around big, raid-like boss fights against the franchise’s detailed assortment of futuristic prehistoric robots. Instead of following the story of franchise protagonist Aloy, players will create their own custom characters and team-up to take down their mechanical quarries across PC and mobile.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date yet but we did get a 10-minute deep-dive into the RPG’s gameplay and development backstory:</p>  <p>You play as a machine hunter in the Deadlands (inspired by Arizona and New Mexico) who hails from one of four tribes: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram. It’s unclear exactly how many other players you’ll be able to team up with or how seamless the world will be as you explore, but early footage teased several different biomes, from fire-ravaged deserts to icy tundra. Players have ground and aerial mounts they can utilize for exploration and combat and there’s one moment in the trailer where players are galloping across a field alongside a mechanical herd as well as one of the series’ iconic Tallnecks.</p>

 <p>I have no idea how it’s supposed to run on phones but it looks great.</p> <p>“<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSoft has built specifically for mobile,” Guerilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said during the video. “You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources, and that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script.”</p>

  <p>A gameplay trailer gives a better sense of how exactly combat will work and it certainly looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>. Players will hack away at enemies, targeting weaknesses and damaging specific parts of them over the course of battle. But it’s not just mashing buttons. Players will also be able to make use of carefully placed traps and grappling hook-like pullcasters to sling-shot themselves around the battlefield and onto enemies’ backs. Based on the UI, it looks like there might even be some sort of stagger mechanic.</p>

 <p>NCSoft executive producer Sunggu Lee said during the developer interview that <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>‘ </em>emphasis will be on teamwork and strategy. As an MMORPG coming out of South Korea built primarily for smartphones, I also expect it to be a heavily monetized XP grind. If the company can make it feel more like a coop Horizon adventure than a second job min-maxing spreadsheets, <em>Horizon</em> meets <em>Monster Hunter</em> has the potential to be really cool. But a lot of that will come down to how smooth and rewarding the moment-to-moment combat looks and feels.</p> <p>Sony is currently all-in on the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. In addition to Guerrilla teasing a third mainline entry in the existing open-world RPG series, there were rumors of a live service multiplayer spin-off based on project footage from 2020 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-aloy-sequel-burning-shores-ps5-1850369063">leaked several years ago</a>. It’s unclear whether that was abandoned, became <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, or remains another multiplayer project in the mix at Sony. There’s also the <em>Horizon</em> movie that’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-movie-date-sony-tencent-lawsuit-last-us-2000636587">slated to begin filming next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Death Stranding is becoming an anime series thanks to the folks at Disney+. Furthermore, creator Hideo Kojima will executive produce while animator Takayuki Sano (Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) will direct the show.</p>







<p>The Death Stranding series is the first new IP from Kojima Productions, led by Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. With two entries, with On the Beach releasing in 2025, the post-apocalyptic strand game has become a hit for PlayStation fans. It helps that it bolsters an all-star cast, led by The Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus, and some great visual and narrative storytelling. A few months ago, Kojima announced more projects based on Death Stranding, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-anime-confirmed-by-hideo-kojima/">an anime movie</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film adaptation from A24</a>. Now, it seems there’s another project in the works and at Disney+, of all places.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The official poster for Death Stranding Isolations, streaming on Disney+</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news comes from Disney at the Disney APAC Showcase, currently going on in Hong Kong. There, the company revealed that it’s releasing Death Stranding Isolations (title not final), a 2D hand-drawn anime, in 2027. The animation will be handled by E&amp;H production, led by Jujutsu Kaisen director Sunghoo Park. Directing the show is Takayuki Sano, whose resume includes anime like Attack on Titan, Banana Fish, and Promare. A short synopsis was also provided by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. It can be found in full below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set in the same world as the video game,&nbsp;Death Stranding Isolations<em>&nbsp;</em>follows Sam Bridges as he attempts to save America, and those trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. </p>



<p>An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p> In attendance at the Disney APAC Showcase was creator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, who will executive produce the show. Speaking on behalf of the team at the event, Kojima stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up loving Japanese anime, and it has shaped my worldview,” said Kojima. “I’ve always been a fan of Disney, since I was small, and I was glad that they showed my documentary on the platform. When they approached me, I decided to work with them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly enough, this isn’t the only anime of Death Stranding we’re getting. Death Stranding: Mosquito, an animated film by ABC Animations, is currently in the works, as well. However, it seems like Sam Porter Bridges is going to be in Isolations and not Mosquito, as far as we know. We’ll likely learn more about both as 2026 comes around, but at least we have a look at the title through the artwork, shown above.</p>







<p>What do you think about Death Stranding Isolations? Did the series need an anime? When do you think it’ll come out in 2027?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-steel-frontiers-how-the-new-mobile-mmorpg-changes-machine-combat.1352104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A brand <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-and-ncsoft-announce-horizon-steel-frontiers-a-new-mobile-first-mmorpg-set-in-guerrillas-horizon-universe-check-out-the-debut-trailer">new Horizon game has been announced</a>, but it’s not the sequel to Forbidden West that you may have been expecting. It’s not a single-player game, nor is it even a PlayStation game. Horizon Steel Frontiers is a MMORPG developed by NCSoft for mobile and PC. Confused? Don’t worry, we’re here to break down everything revealed in the debut trailer. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the idea of an online multiplayer Horizon game sounds familiar, then you’ve likely been paying attention to the rumours that began as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-reportedly-in-the-works-alongside-a-multiplayer-game">far back as 2022</a>. At first glance, it’s clear that this is very much a Horizon game you can play with a team of co-op buddies. The world looks very similar to what we’ve explored before, however this time we’ll be headed to the Deadlands, a brand new region inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Within that location are plenty of recognisable elements, from destroyed remains of humanity’s past, to the real stars of Horizon: its giant mechanical beasts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But let's start with something less familiar. It’s clear that Steel Frontiers has a different approach to combat compared to its predecessors. Where the single-player games largely focus on ranged combat, using weapons like bows to shoot enemy weakpoints, this new take on the universe seems to be predominantly focused on melee. The trailer’s focal character uses a huge sword, while other characters can be seen using dual blades to slice and dice their way through machine armour. That’s not to say archery has been eliminated – a bow still features throughout the trailer – but blade combat appears to be front and center. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-sword-1762959243816.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There seems to not just be a change in distance between you and your foe, but a dramatic re-think of combat fundamentals. The trailer demonstrates a charged blade ability that can be used to deflect an incoming attack, a type of defensive strategy that’s brand new to Horizon. When it comes to the offensive, you can now, after destroying a specific part of a machine, use the Pullcaster grapple hook to climb onto your target and place a status-inflicting trap on the damaged part. NCSoft has said that elements like this are part of a new approach that tailors Horizon’s existing ideas to suit an MMORPG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear that lots of Horizon’s combat DNA still remains – we can see machine parts detach in every fight, such as when the main character shoots off a Blaze canister in the trailer’s opening battle. And later, we can see that destroyed machines leave behind resources to pick up. But from what’s shown in this trailer, it seems like Steel Frontiers may feel more like Monster Hunter than traditional Horizon. Executive producer Sung-Gu Lee explains that at the core of the experience is “cooperation and strategy”, and that “players must take on their roles,” ideas that form the basis of Monster Hunter’s multiplayer expeditions. Furthermore, we even see some characters cooking a meal in a cutscene that resembles the chef montages from Monster Hunter’s own meal prep system. Perhaps all this shouldn’t come as a surprise, though: there’s certainly more than a little of Capcom’s series in Horizon already.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other combat additions we can see in the trailer include some kind of sticky bomb that can be used to deal massive damage to machines – perhaps this is one of those aforementioned traps? You also now have the ability to pack machine weapons on your mount, allowing you to transport heavy artillery from one battle to another.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-mount-1762959265554.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of mounts, we see almost all of the tameable machines from Forbidden West being used in this trailer. It opens with a Bristleback being Overridden and claimed as a mount, and later we see characters riding Sunwings and Chargers. We also see confirmation of a brand new mount: the trailer’s protagonist rides on the back of a Stalker, the stealth camo-equipped, Panther-like machine. Considering Forbidden West expanded the number of mounts available, and MMORPGs are typically known for their range of mounts, it seems likely that even more machines will be available for taming. With any luck, this is the game where we can finally pilot a Thunderjaw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t actually see Horizon’s iconic, metallic T-Rex in this trailer, but there are over a dozen other machines on display here, from the tiny all the way up to the gigantic. The most impressive fight sees a group take on a Slaughterspine, which uses many of the abilities it did in Forbidden West, including its rain of munitions. Other examples of “Oh god please don’t kill me” machines include the fearsome Fireclaw, a napalm-spewing robo-bear, and a huge snake-like machine that looks like a Slitherfang crossed with a Rockbreaker, which is very likely our first glimpse of a new variety of metal monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest creature, though, is the Tallneck, and we can see a group of machine hunters attempting to bring one down in the desert. Once again, these look like they’ll be large climbing puzzles, judged on the way the characters climb its neck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the smaller side, we can spot a Watcher, some Grazers, a Plowhorn, a Trampler, a Ravager, and a Shellwalker… whose shell is whisked away into the sky by a Glinthawk. It seems like NCSoft understands the mission when it comes to enemy variety.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-dungeon-1762959281074.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the world looks suitably like Horizon’s signature vision of the future. Lush green foliage has overtaken the ruins of human skyscrapers, people live in villages that take inspiration from Native American tribes, and below the ground lie giant vaults filled with advanced technology . These “Cauldrons” return from the single-player Horizon games, but can now be explored with a team of allied players. It seems sensible to guess that these Cauldrons may be Steel Frontiers’ equivalent to the classic MMORPG dungeon.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, a great deal of what we’ve seen looks very close to what we’d expect of a Horizon game. Steel Frontiers has been developed in collaboration with original developer Guerrilla, and so no doubt many efforts have been made to keep the visual style and many gameplay ideas consistent. However, with the Korean-based NCSoft being the lead developer, you can also see some more Eastern elements finding their place in this universe. All the characters have an anime-like aesthetic, looking more like folks from Final Fantasy or NCSoft’s own Lineage games, rather than the characters from the original Horizon series. There’s even a bit of a cutesy thing going on with a character’s wearing metal cat ears – something we’d never see the serious Aloy wear in a thousand years. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-cat-ears-1762959611713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you're a Horizon purist, you may be able to create a character that’s more in-line with the original games’ aesthetic in the character creator. This being an MMORPG, you won’t be playing as Aloy or any other pre-written protagonist, but a character of your own design. The character creator seems reasonably in-depth, and also allows you to choose which tribe you’ll join: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram – all groups previously established in Horizon lore. The trailer’s narration hints at competitive PvP as well as co-op machine hunting, so it may be that your tribe also acts as your “team” in such scenarios.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Steel Frontiers looks to contain much of what we’d expect from Horizon, from RPG dialogue sequences to giant metal monster fights, this is certainly set to be a new and different take on the universe we’ve come to love over the last couple of PlayStation generations. Not to mention, it’s a Horizon game we’ll be playing on our phones, not our PS5s. But did you spot anything new and interesting in the trailer that we missed? Let us know your sharp observations in the comments below, as well as what you think of this new MMO direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-trailer-breakdown]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>And here are some comments from NCSOFT chief corporate officer Taekjin Kim, Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek, and NCSOFT executive producer Sung-Gu Lee, via the announcement video:</p><div><p><strong>Taekjin Kim, NCSOFT Chief Corporate Officer</strong></p><p>“When I fist experienced <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in 2017, I was instantly drawn into its vibrant and captivating world. The battles against colossal machine lifeforms were exhilarating and the mysterious narrative sparked my curiosity, urging me to explore every corner of that universe. Yet I couldn’t help but feel a little wistful that such an incredible world had to be experienced alone. I imagined how thrilling it would be to meet others, to team up and face these massive machines together.</p><p>“From the beginning, I was convinced: battling machine lifeforms would be far more exciting than facing any fantasy monster. That vision inspired us to create an MMO set in this extraordinary universe. And today, I’m proud to present <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>—a dream realized. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> represents a new challenge for NC, and the start of an exciting journey ahead. We hope you look forward to this new <em>Horizon</em> born from the collaboration between NC and Guerrilla.”</p><p><strong>Jan-Bart van Beek, Guerrilla Games Studio Director</strong></p><p>“I was the one who originally came up with the concept of the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. The <em>Horizon</em> franchise is incredibly special to me and to everyone at Guerrilla. It’s a world we’ve poured our hearts and souls into. It’s a place where humanity, nature, and technology are constantly colliding. It’s become a vibrant and living world full of stories, tribal cultures, and of course, those incredible animal-like machines that rule the land.</p><p>“From the very beginning of creating this franchise, we’ve imagined the <em>Horizon</em> universe as one that could be experienced in many different ways. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSOFT has built specifically for mobile. With <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, you can step into this world, anywhere, anytime.</p><p>“Players take on the role of machine hunters, chasing opportunity in a region called the Deadlands, which is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources. And that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments you could never script.</p><p>“At the heart of the <em>Horizon</em> story is the search for the balance between humanity, nature, and technology. Sometimes that’s harmony, sometimes that’s conflict. But it always creates a world filled with mystery and beauty. What we want players to feel is the world’s resilience and its hope. And that even when everything seems overwhelming, humanity can adapt, can survive, and find meaning in the world.</p><p>“We already had groups at Guerrilla playing <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> together at the office, and it’s really amazing. Whenever I get a chance to jump in on an early gameplay test, what really stands out is <em>Steel Frontiers</em>‘ distinct tone and atmosphere. It has a unique identity of its own, and has been brought to life by NCSOFT’s developers. But it fits perfectly with the Horizon universe, and that balance with the essence of <em>Horizon</em> and something fresh is what really excites me about this project.”</p><p><strong>Sung-Gu Lee, NCSOFT Executive Producer</strong></p><p>“I’m a bit nervous to present this project to the world for the first time, but at the same time, I’m extremely excited. The core concept of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> can be summed up in one phrase: the thrill of taking down colossal machines. Hunting massive machines was one of the greatest appeals of the original&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> series. And now, we’re expanding that experience into the world of MMORPGs.</p><p>“Our main focus is designing a new combat experience tailored for an MMORPG. In <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, we’ve added unique, original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines. For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine, you can quickly approach and climb onto it using a Pullcaster, set traps on the damaged part, and inflict status effects. During battle, you can even pick up weapons dropped by the machine, carry them on your mount, and use them in subsequent fights. At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values. cooperation and strategy. Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly. These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide.</p><p>“In <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, every player is a hero. We’ve put great care into customization, allowing you to fully express your individuality—even down to the smallest details. During character creation, we’ve incorporated the tribes from the original <em>Horizon</em> world. You can choose from diverse tribes such as Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram, and create your character based on your preferred tribe. Our system provides a high degree of freedom, so you can design your character exactly as you envision—from facial features, body type, and hair, to makeup and finer details. The characters you create can be shared with other players, allowing you not only to show off your own style, but also draw inspiration from others to further customize your hero. Step into <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> as a truly unique machine hunter, crafted entirely by you, and explore a world where your individuality matters.</p><p>“In the world of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, you’ll be able to develop your own character, team up with friends to hunt colossal machines, and live the story of a machine hunter in the Deadlands. We can’t wait to see you all become the heroes of this adventure, and we’re doing our best to make that day come as soon as possible.”</p></div><p>Watch the announcement video and gameplay trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/ncsoft-announces-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-for-pc-ios-and-android]]></content:encoded>

<p>As it expands into mobile gaming with a major IP</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In recent years, Nintendo has been able to grow its brand and expand its IP with mobile game apps. To date, the cumulative number of unique downloads for Nintendo apps has now surpassed 950 million, and it's banked a lot of coin in that time.</p>
<p>It's a market that's ripe for the picking, and in some industry news this week, Sony's PlayStation Studios has now announced it will be stepping up its game with the release of a new "free to download" <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ratchet_and_clank_rift_apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> multiplayer mobile title. As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/new-ratchet-and-clank-game-announced-but-not-for-the-platform-you-want">Push Square</a> note, although Sony has been dabbling with mobile games for a while, this is seemingly "one of the first real attempts" to bring its IP to this platform.</p>
<p>The game is officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/new-ratchet-and-clank-game-announced-but-not-for-the-platform-you-want">Ratchet and Clank: Ranger Rumble</a></strong>, and it's notably drawn some comparisons to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a> and even the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. The Metroid comparison has been spurred on by a mode called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_blast">Blast Ball</a>, which you might remember was a dedicated competitive multiplayer experience on the 3DS.</p>

<p>Much like Nintendo with Super Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and other IP like Fire Emblem, PlayStation appears to be following up this Ratchet &amp; Clank title with a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/the-next-horizon-game-is-an-mmo-by-ncsoft-for-pc-mobile">new Horizon MMO for mobile (and PC)</a> that's already leaked.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a huge audience on mobile, so Nintendo and PlayStation can easily co-exist, but this is a notable development on the PlayStation front. And it's easy to see why Sony might have also considered this market after the success Nintendo has had in this space. After all, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/sony-once-again-takes-a-leaf-from-nintendos-playbook-in-japan">always kept a close eye on Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>As for Nintendo's mobile expansion, it most recently launched the new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> on Android and iOS devices in September. Earlier this month, it also released a new mobile application in select regions, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-releases-a-storefront-app-for-android-and-ios">allows users to access its storefront</a>. In some other industry news, Valve has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/random-steams-brand-new-game-console-sure-looks-awfully-familiar">a new Steam Machine this week</a>, and Nintendo dropped a trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/12-details-you-might-have-missed-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">the new Mario Movie</a>.</p>

We spilled details about the game before it was revealed based on an announcement video we saw, and that video has been officially posted — and more has been shared about the title, too.</p><p>The new game is called <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, and Sony and the Korean video game company NCSoft are working on the cross platform title together for PC, iOS, and Android. It will be free to play, <a href="https://hsf.plaync.com/en-us/conts/teaser#platform">according to the game’s website</a>. Based on the more than 10-minute announcement video, which features a mix of cinematic and pre-alpha gameplay footage as well as developer interviews, the game will focus strongly on fighting the <em>Horizon</em> series’ giant mechanical beasts and being able to do so with other people.</p><p>Sony and a PR company representing NCSoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. <em>The Verge</em> initially spotted promotional art for <em>Steel Frontiers</em> on a website used to share game assets that media and influencers are approved to use. The art was posted early ahead of the <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/ncsoft-unveils-horizon-steel-frontiers/">official announcement</a> at the G-Star 2025 event in Korea.

Players take on the role of machine hunters, chasing opportunity in a region called the Deathlands. This is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources, and that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Pre-alpha footage of </em>Horizon Steel Frontiers<em> from a video seen by </em>The Verge <em>before the game’s announcement.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>“The core concept of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> can be summed up in one phrase: the thrill of taking down colossal machines,” executive producer Sung-Gu Lee says in the video. “Hunting massive machines was one of the greatest appeals of the original <em>Horizon</em> series. And now, we’re expanding that experience into the world of MMORPGs.” Lee says there will be new mechanics for fighting the machines, like picking up dropped weapons from beasts and carrying them on a mount to use in later fights. As part of the full announcement, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HorizonSteelFrontiers"><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> YouTube channel</a> posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4">gameplay trailer</a> featuring fights against beasts in the game.</p><p>The announcement video also highlights the game’s character customization features — in <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, instead of playing as Aloy, who has been the series protagonist so far, you’ll be able to make your own character.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Pre-alpha footage of </em>Horizon Steel Frontiers<em> from a video seen by </em>The Verge <em>before the game’s announcement.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Sony and NCSoft haven’t shared a release date, but Lee says in the announcement video that the team is working to make the game available “as soon as possible.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 13th</strong>: Added details from the official reveal.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An MMORPG based on PlayStation and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series has been leaked before its official reveal. We now know several details surrounding the game, now called Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p>







<p>While a newer IP, the Horizon series, consisting of 2017’s Zero Dawn and 2022’s Forbidden West, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-franchise-32m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-received by critics</a>. The third-person post-apocalyptic shooter is known for its gorgeous graphics and intuitive open-world gameplay. With hulking mechanical monsters and a lush environment, Horizon’s iconic settings make for the perfect setup for games outside of the main series. We did see LEGO Horizon Adventures and a VR spinoff, but it’s stayed in its lane for a bit. However, rumors of an MMORPG had surfaced over the past years, but it was thought to be cancelled. However, according to new information, it seems it’s here and, most likely, will be revealed quite soon.</p>



<p>UPDATE: Horizon Steel Frontiers is, indeed real, as PlayStation and NCSoft announced the project soon after publication. The video mentioned in the article <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiogVFtmchg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>. Most of the details regarding gameplay and such can be found below.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-minute-video-of-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-coming-soon-according-to-leak">10-Minute Video of MMORPG Horizon Steel Frontiers Coming Soon, According to Leak</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked key art from Horizon Steel Frontiers </figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which supposedly saw a 10-minute video of the Horizon MMORPG, called Horizon Steel Frontiers. It even included key art, which we have above. Supposedly, the game is set to be revealed at the G-STAR 2025 event, but information came out early. </p>



<p>In the article, it mentions that the game is a collaboration between PlayStation and Korean developer NCSoft. The video, planned to be shown there, showcases gameplay, both complete and in development. As it is an MMORPG, instead of playing as Aloy, you’ll create your own character and join others in the world, called the Deathlands. It also says that the title will release on PC, iOS, and Android. No mention of a release date or if it will go to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As the game is not yet confirmed, take the news with a grain of salt for now. However, given the content leaked, it’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before it’s announced. Either way, it will be interesting to see how Horizon fits into the MMORPG genre and the differences between it and the main series.</p>

                <p>Valve has unveiled its first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">its new gaming machines</a>, including Steam Frame, a virtual reality headset that can handle VR and non-VR games. Apparently, Steam Frame is also being used as a way to bring Android games directly to Steam users.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve will support and encourage developers to bring Android apps to Steam. As part of this initiative, Valve will release a Steam Frame developer kit for developers who already use Android APKs for apps and VR headsets on Android phones.</p><p>"From the user's perspective, our preference is that they don't even have to think about it," explains Valve engineer Jeremy Selan. "They just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play ... They're really VR developers who want to publish their VR content, and they're porting a mobile VR title where they're already familiar with how to make those APKs. They are now free to bring those to Steam, and they'll just work on this device."</p><p>This seamless transition from Android to Steam is possible because Steam Frame uses an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which can run the apps directly. That will allow the Android games and VR apps to be easily accessed on Steam Frame.</p><p>In addition to Steam Frame, Valve announced a Steam Machine that can bring PC games to living rooms like a console, as well as a new Steam Controller. Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">hasn't disclosed pricing for any of its new Steam hardware</a> yet, but hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Steam Machine will likely be competitively priced to be an affordable alternative to consoles.</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," said Aldehayyat.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-with-ai-features-are-going-for-pennies-amazon-sets-a-new-all-time-low.1351990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium wireless earbuds have become one of those purchases where the options feel endless and the prices keep climbing higher. You’ve got Apple’s AirPods Pro at $249, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro at similar pricing, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro normally sitting at the same $249 mark. The specs all start to blur together after a while, and trying to figure out which pair actually delivers the best value can feel overwhelming. Price becomes a major factor when everything seems comparable on paper, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">right now Amazon has dropped the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to just $174, down from their usual $249</a>. This is a new all-time low that you won’t even find on Samsung’s official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <strong>pack AI-powered features</strong> that are constantly adapting to your environment throughout the day. Samsung’s sound optimization technology analyses the shape of your ear canal to adjust audio output for balanced sound that matches your unique anatomy. This happens automatically in the background, so you’re not always tweaking equalizer settings and wondering if you’re missing out on certain frequencies. The <strong>AI continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts the intensity of active noise cancellation</strong> to match and ramps up when you step onto a busy street and dialing back when you’re in quieter spaces.</p>



<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro works through a <strong>combination of external and internal microphones</strong> that capture ambient sound and generate inverse sound waves to cancel unwanted noise. The technology proves especially effective at eliminating low-frequency rumble from airplane engines, subway cars, or air conditioning units. You’ll notice the difference immediately on your commute as traffic noise fades into the background and you can finally hear podcast dialogue clearly without cranking the volume to dangerous levels.<strong> Transparency mode</strong> flips this system around and pips in external sounds when you need to hear announcements, have quick conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings while walking.</p>



<p>Samsung redesigned the fit for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to address one of the most common complaints in its predecessors: This <strong>new ergonomic contour sits more securely in your ear</strong> without creating pressure points that cause discomfort after an hour or two of wear. You get three different ear tip sizes in the box, and the companion app includes a fit test that plays audio to verify you’ve created a proper seal. Getting this seal right is enormously important for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness, since even small gaps let sound leak in and bass frequencies escape.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> maintains stable connections for the typical range you’d expect from modern wireless earbuds, staying paired reliably when your phone is in your pocket or bag. Pairing happens quickly through Samsung’s ecosystem if you own a Galaxy phone, as the earbuds pop up automatically on screen when you open the case near your device. Android users outside the Samsung ecosystem and <strong>even iPhone owners can still pair these earbuds</strong> through standard Bluetooth settings, though they’ll miss out on some of the deeper integration features that Galaxy phone users enjoy.</p>
<p>Battery life gives you about six hours of continuous playback with active noise cancellation enabled, which will cover most daily use scenarios, like commutes, work sessions, or gym visits. With the charging case included, y<strong>ou get about 26 hours of total listening time</strong> before you’ll need to find an outlet; it also supports USB-C wired charging and wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads. With just a five-minute charge, you can attain about an hour of playback in case you are in a hurry and forget that your earbuds are dead.</p>
<p>This is one of the best deals on Samsung’s earbuds so far in 2025.</p>

      <p>We're proud and <em>incredibly </em>excited to announce some new Aftermath merch: a collaboration with artist<a href="https://linktr.ee/Aurumek?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Simon Hintermann, aka Aurumek</u></a>, on a new piece called 'Printe Shoppe', which is available now<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud?ref=aftermath.ghost.io"> <u>on our store</u></a>.</p><p>It depicts Aftermath working as we'd <em>all </em>presumably like to spend our days: not hunched over computers, which are inherently evil, but relaxing in our quaint countryside office, blue sky overhead, each letter of each blog being slotted purposefully into a printing press by hand. Thoughtful work, <em>human </em>work.</p><p>The art is available as both <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a print and a premium unisex t-shirt</u></a> (available in 'natural’ and 'black' colourways). I've got the print framed in my living room and it looks <em>amazing, </em>and all proceeds are split between all humans involved.</p><p>You can buy both (and all our other merch, from hoodies to mugs to<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud/products/new-combined-listing-offer?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>our 'Destroy AI' tee</u></a>)<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>at the Aftermath store</u></a>.</p><p>(Also: <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/account/plans" rel="noreferrer">subscribers to our Member and Benefactor tiers</a> get a discount at our merch store.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine-2000643568</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine.1351966/</guid>

              <p>Finding a laptop that can handle everything from pro-level video editing to more casual gaming means spending upwards of $3,000, and that’s something most people simply can’t justify. Everyone wants a powerful machine that doesn’t chug when the work starts to get serious but the budgetary reality most are faced with compromises. Until now. This early Black Friday deal on Amazon completely upends that equation by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">the Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM, etc) from its usual $3,299 price all the way down to just $995</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 70% discount on a true performance powerhouse</strong>, and the deal isn’t even available on Dell’s own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor powers this machine with the kind of processing muscle you would expect from significantly more expensive laptops. This chip has speeds up to 5.4 GHz and boasts a hybrid architecture, with <strong>10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, all working across 12 threads</strong>. You get three separate engines inside: CPU tasks, GPU graphics, and NPU AI acceleration. In other words, it handles everything from complex spreadsheets to AI-powered applications with ease.</p>



<h2>Ideal for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM changes the way you work as slowdowns that plague machines with less memory are gone. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple Adobe Creative Suite apps at once, have multiple Excel workbooks processing data, and still switch between everything instantly. Compared to DDR4 found in older laptops, DDR5 provides faster data transfer rates which means your processor spends less time waiting for information and more actually processing your work.</p>



<p>The touchscreen features a 16-inch WQXGA display with 1920 x 1200 resolution and offers more vertical real estate compared to the usual 1080p panel. That extra height makes a difference when you code, read long documents or deal with a spreadsheet that requires a few more rows visible at once. The 300-nit brightness is sufficient for you to comfortably work in well-lit offices or near windows while the anti-glare coating prevents reflections from turning your screen into a mirror.</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt 4 port delivers transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and means you can transfer whole project folders to external drives in seconds, rather than minutes. This same port supports dual 4K displays or a single 8K monitor, turning your laptop into a multiscreen workstation when you’re at your desk. Combined with traditional USB 3.2 ports for peripherals, HDMI for presentations, and WiFi 6E for lightning-fast wireless connections, this laptop connects to everything you need without requiring a drawer full of adapters.</p>
<p>This is one of the best laptop deals you can get right now, and it’s exclusively available at Amazon.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/runescape-3/" data-ref-id="5000-174981">RuneScape's</a> Treasure Hunter microtransactions will soon be no more, after the game's community overwhelmingly voted to see it and other similar microtransactions removed. Developer Jagex is calling it a "new era" for the MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video announcing the decision, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy (known to the community as Mod North) said "the community has spoken," and as such, Treasure Hunter will be removed on January 19, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature sees players granted keys each day that can be used to open what are effectively loot boxes containing XP, gold, and more. While players are granted a number of keys for free each day, keys can also be bought for real money. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/runescapes-future-may-be-radically-reshaped-after-fan-vote/1100-6535811/" data-ref-id="1100-6535811">120,000 players voted</a> to see Treasure Hunter and other microtransactions removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JCjHVGbFwr4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, just the start of Jagex's plans. Bellamy said on the same day Treasure Hunter is removed, Jagex will also significantly reduce the amount of "gameplay-impacting MTX across the board." That includes the ability to purchase items that grant direct XP, as well as other items like Proteans, Dummies, and more, North said.</p><p dir="ltr">"January 19 is the start of a new era for RuneScape, powered by a shared desire to see this game grow for decades to come," North said.</p><p dir="ltr">Next year, Jagex will release an "integrity roadmap" that will address core issues surrounding the game, including the user interface and user experience, the game's visual identity, and more. Additional details will be shared on January 19.</p><p dir="ltr">Removing Treasure Hunter has been a long time coming. In June, Bellamy noted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbIXekZocI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> that its approach to microtransactions was "harming RuneScape" and stated "it's time that we took action. Jagex then experimented with a number of different changes to in-game purchases. In September, Bellamy said in an <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/jagex-prepared-to-take-financial" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> that Jagex "probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are" when making changes to microtransactions.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the truth," Bellamy said. "But equally, if we're taking a 10 or 15 or 25-year view, some short-term pain is probably worth the restoration of the game if we can get to that point."</p><p dir="ltr">Jagex's adherence to a community vote for the removal of Treasure Hunter is similar to how it handles the much less microtransaction-heavy Old School RuneScape. Released in 2013 and based on the 2007 version of RuneScape, Old School Runescape is now far more popular than the more modern RuneScape (aka RuneScape 3). New features are only added to Old School RuneScape if 70% of its community votes for them.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-ref-id="1100-6533697">Old School RuneScape is more popular than ever before</a>, and even broke player number records earlier this year with more than 241,000 concurrent players. The MMO's first new skill as voted on by the community, <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sailing</a>, is set to release November 19.</p>
