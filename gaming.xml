			<p>Wildgate was easily the most exciting thing featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uwjr0raU7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamhaven Showcase</a> that just ended, and we're here to tell you all about it. We've been able to not only see a presentation and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-qa-were-definitely-thinking-about-joining-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk to the developers</a> but also play it. It won't be long before you get to play it, too, as developer Moonshot Games is hosting a Community Preview playtest between April 14 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. To register, head to the <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Since you might have forgotten, Dreamhaven was founded <a href="https://wccftech.com/dreamhaven-studio-blizzard-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in September 2020</a> by former Blizzard founder Mike Morhaime and other Blizzard expatriates. It's a multi-team studio, but Wildgate appears to be their lineup's jewel, and the team behind it features people like Dustin Browder and Justin Lane, who worked on games like World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Hearthstone, and lots more.</p>
<p>In the presentation, they revealed that Moonshot came up with 30 different one-page pitches and distilled them down to the top five, before eventually choosing Wildgate, which they did partially based on the studio values. The first one is 'Force For Good', which was described as a 'super important one' by Jason. This is a sci-fi-based game, and there's some bleak sci-fi out there. With Wildgate, Moonshot wants players to think about positive, optimistic futures. This pillar also ties into how the studio wishes to build the community over time and establish a positive approach to the game and how it will be released.</p>
<p>The next pillar is 'Shared Creative Ownership'. Jason said this speaks to one of Moonshot's big cultural goals: everyone on the team can contribute different ideas to help shape the game and the universe. The objective is to be 'swimming in a sea of little inventions', working together as a team to come up with ideas instead of having them exclusively driven from the top down.</p>
<p>The third one is 'Awe and Wonder'. The developers believe that games can take you back to feeling like a kid again, to seeing the world with fresh eyes and a sense of wonder when people first have a sense of the things out there bigger than them. Sometimes, that can be a feeling of wonder and happiness, and sometimes, it can be a little bit terrifying. This mix is Moonshot's goal in terms of how they are developing Wildgate.</p>
<p>Lastly, 'Memorable Stories' speaks to the kind of experience that they want users to have in the game. Due to the studio's background, the developers think a lot about things like balance and a really balanced play experience. But the goal is also that everybody leaves with a story, that something unique happens to you and the people you're playing with that's very memorable and you're taking away with you as you move on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wildgate | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2jvZzieaBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The team then offered an overview of the lore they created for the game. There's a civilization that spans much of the galaxy called the Accord, and it's made up of all kinds of strange creatures working together. They have a shared government and they exchange technologies, working together to explore the galaxy. The example Dustin shared was Star Trek's Federation, except composed of the funny creatures you might find in a Star Wars cantina. Anyway, as the Accord finds new races, they incorporate them and invite them to join, again like the Federation. Most species are reasonably peaceful after reaching space travel, except for one that claims to be the 'Firstborn'. These creatures are around 50 million years into their evolution and they're very old. They think that they are the oldest civilization, having expanded and killed off all the others they encountered, but they're actually not, as the universe also featured species that have long since vanished: the so-called Builders, Artisans, and Primes. These ancient civilizations only left behind a few, albeit immensely powerful, artifacts.</p>
<p>The Firstborn attacked the Accord, beginning a hundred-year war. Wildgate isn't actually about this war; it takes place right after. However, Moonshot still wrote hundreds of pages of in-universe history so that the game's characters are grounded in a universe that feels real. Some of the characters fought in the war, while others were in an academy and were hoping to join the war when it finally ended.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Firstborn are eventually defeated by the Accord. This Federation-like union of civilizations is now ready to start exploring the galaxy once again, and they take a particular interest in the Typhon Reach, a mysterious area of space that is full of cosmic storms and quantum meteorites. The main reason is that this sector of space houses artifacts left by those truly ancient civilizations discussed before. These artifacts can be extremely powerful. For example, they could restore a planet decimated by the war, so they are obviously in great demand. That's where players come in. Wildgate is about Prospectors who are willing to risk it all to travel to the most dangerous place in the galaxy and retrieve artifacts for the Accord.</p>
<p>In practice, this is a PvP team-based multiplayer action/adventure game. Sessions are composed of 20 players where groups of four crew a total of five starships, exploring ruins, finding experimental technology and battling other players. The Typhon Reach map is created procedurally so that it will be completely fresh in all matches, ensuring Prospectors will always be faced with a new area of space to explore. The teams need to explore and figure out what's going on in this version of the Reach.</p>
<p>Each party has its own spaceship, all of which will appear at a random location. If you die, you'll respawn on your ship. There's no limit to respawns as long as your ship is intact; when it's destroyed, it is game over for your group. The way to win is to collect the artifact and take it to the titular Wildgate.</p>
<p>It takes a variable amount of time for that gate to open. Once it is, anybody can get the artifact, put it on their ship, and fly it out of the Reach. The other way you can win a match is to be the last ship standing. Lastly, the developers told us of another far rarer (estimated to occur possibly once every fifty games or so) way that a session can end: if the last two remaining ships are fighting and both are destroyed at roughly the same time, the Reach gets the win. Matches last twenty to forty minutes. To ensure an even playing field, players get a fresh ship with every new match.</p>
<p>Having played a couple of matches, I can tell you it's a blast of fun. The art style is definitely very reminiscent of Blizzard's work, but in terms of gameplay, it reminded me a lot of a sci-fi version of Rare's Sea of Thieves, which I told the developers during the Q&amp;A. Wildgate is sandboxy enough that matches can develop very differently, though the basic loop is exploring the Reach, venturing into ruins populated by NPC monsters to gather upgrades to improve your ship as you continue to scout for the other Prospector teams and, of course, for the artifact and the Wildgate itself.</p>
<p>The shooting is arcade-like rather than realistic, fitting with the universe created by Moonshot, but it feels good. Arguably, the most fun part, though, was using Probes, little drones that you can take control of to explore other areas, discover points of interest, and, most critically, spy on enemy players. However, there's a lot more, like manning the turrets, putting out fires, and possibly boarding enemy ships to steal loot.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four main spaceships in the game, differing in shapes and sizes but also amount of health, speed, number of cannons, layouts, et cetera. The party leader will be the default Captain who chooses the spaceship. After choosing their Prospector, each of which comes with different passive abilities, players also customize the loadout with different weapons and gadgets. Personally, I loved the heal gun, which heals yourself and allies but also has a secondary fire that damages foes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wildgate 4K Preview Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ML1pHH2szaM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As hinted earlier, it's not just NPCs and enemy players that you have to take care of when navigating the Typhon Reach. There are also various environmental hazards that may influence whether you win or not. Ultimately, though, while the developers reckon this is not an extraction game, the truth is you can kind of play it as one. It is entirely possible that the four crews are too focused on fighting one another while the fifth sneaks in, finds the artifacts, and makes for the Wildgate without even having had to fight the others.</p>
<p>It's way too early to come up with a definitive evaluation, but the game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve the PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun. Wildgate is currently slated to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with a premium business model.</p>

Samsung says it’s working with developers “to make the most out of this 3D technology,” as upcoming games like <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> and <em>Lies of P. </em>DLC <em>Overture</em> will be optimized for the monitor. The display features a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms gray-to-gray response time, along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.</p><p>The Odyssey 3D can also convert “nearly all” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs">content into 3D using the panel’s lenticular lens</a>, but there are some big caveats. You can only use the feature if your PC has an Nvidia graphics card (RTX 3080 or higher is recommended), and you can’t use it with DRM-protected content. Samsung also notes that some video players might not support the 3D conversion tool, adding that it’s not available in HDR mode, either.</p><p>Along with the Odyssey 3D, Samsung is launching the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF) next month. The 27-inch model costs $1,299.99, according to <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/693198/samsung-odyssey-oled-g8-g81sf-27-4k-uhd-(3840-x-2160)-240hz-gaming-monitor">a listing still live on MicroCenter</a>, and offers a 4K OLED display sitting at 166 pixels-per-inch (PPI). It comes with a .03ms gray-to-gray response time, a 240Hz refresh rate, and a built-in system that protects against burn-in.</p><p>There’s a new 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G91F) model as well, with a product page on Best Buy (that’s also been taken down) suggesting a cheaper, $999.99 price. This monitor comes with a dual QHD display with a 1ms response time and a lower 144Hz refresh rate compared to the 240Hz with the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-odyssey-g9-dqhd-240hz-1ms-gtg-displayhdr-1000-gaming-monitor-ls49cg954enxza/">Odyssey G9 G95C</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung is also launching a ViewFinity S8 (S80UD) monitor with a larger 37-inch 4K display for $599.99, as shown on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-37-viewfinity-s8-s80ud-led-4k-uhd-high-resolution-monitor-with-hdr10-usb-c-and-ergonomic-stand-black/6615666.p?skuId=6615666">this Best Buy product page</a>.

            <p>
I'm absolutely naff when it comes to geography, whether it be the version in school which is actually more about rocks and rivers than places, or said places themselves and where they are. I just don't know where things are! And that's fine. Even still, like many others I partook in a good few games of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/geoguessr">GeoGuessr</a> during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and found it to be good fun, particularly with some friends. And now, five years on since that whole thing happened, the geography guessing game is coming to Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3478870/GeoGuessr_Steam_Edition/?curator_clanid=3693985">GeoGuessr Steam Edition</a>, as it's appropriately called, is actually apparently going to be an early access title. The explanation for this given on the game's Steam page is the usual kind of thing, refining gameplay, adding features, getting direct feedback. It also notes that the dev's goal is to create the "ultimate competitive and casual geography game", which is a funny goal to have in mind given that it is generally the first game you immediately think of within that incredibly niche genre.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date just yet but the Steam page says that it's actually coming next month, which is literally a week away, so you've not got long to wait. The thing that isn't particularly clear right now is how it will be priced. Right now the web version of the game, which has been around for 12 years I might add, requires a subscription to play more than three rounds a day, something that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessr/comments/19aipld/pro_subscription_will_be_needed_to_continue/">wasn't all that well received</a> when the change was announced last year.
</p>
<p>
The game's Steam page does note that the price won't change during its early access period, and is unlikely to change afterwards, so this version might be a one-off payment. Fingers crossed! Bloody sick of subscription fees.

In that small sliver of footage, fans saw signs that the much-sought-after return of Lagiacrus could be happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right at the end of the Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, over the Title Update 2 text, we hear some aquatic sounds, followed by a telltale clawed foot and scales. The signs feel fairly obvious that this is going to be Lagiacrus, a monster that hunters have been eager to fight again for quite some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Introduced in Monster Hunter 3, a.k.a. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-3-tri">Monster Hunter Tri</a>, Lagi was the "flagship monster" for the game, which meant it appeared on the box art. Alongside being the posterboy for Tri, the monster was fairly unique for one key reason: it incorporated underwater fighting. Submerged bouts were a big thing for Monster Hunter Tri, and Lagi was the prime example of that. Later versions in Monster Hunter Generations moved the fight back onto land, and the monster has been largely unseen since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190910120310/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/lagiacrus-was-prototyped-for-monster-hunter-world" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom confirmed it had prototyped a new Lagiacrus fight</a> for Monster Hunter: World, even showing <a href="https://x.com/johntv/status/976962161116196864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some visual confirmation of it</a> during a GDC 2018 panel. It was ultimately pulled, though some of its tech was incorporated in another monster, Jyuratodus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the time spent apart has not dulled players' love for Lagiacrus. For some, Monster Hunter Tri was a big entrance into the series. And this fight, with its fairly unique look and mechanics, the possibilities for a Lagiacrus fight are simply exciting. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/13gt78b/why_does_everyone_seem_to_be_obsessed_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user pointed out</a> several years ago in a thread asking why people are so excited for Lagi, "People who wish for Lagiacrus to return generally mean for underwater combat to return also, it's sort of a package deal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique mechanics aside, Lagiacrus has remained popular in its own right. The leviathan came in third in a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/20th/en/vote-monster/result/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popularity poll for Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary</a>, beaten out only by No. 2 Nergigante and No. 1 Zinogre. One of its variants, Abyssal Lagiacrus, also came in 12th, beating out Monter Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 addition Mizutsune at 14th.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-26-1742912521189.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lagiacrus looks like it's on the way to Monster Hunter Wilds.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2022, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-lagiacrus-not-in-game-why-explained">speaking to IGN</a>, Monster Hunter producer explained why Lagiacrus wouldn't see a return in the current game at the time, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. Though the producer acknowledged the "desire is definitely there," the technical implementation is difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Unfortunately Lagiacrus is just a very technological…difficult monster to implement. It's very snake-like, its parts are all kind of touching the ground at different moments,” Tsujimoto explained at the time. “So it's very like a writhing sort of ground-based monster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet now, Capcom has elected to bring the writhing monster back. Whether this is a solely land affair, a new variant, or we see some sort of implementation of water mechanics all remains to be seen. Fans, however, are certainly enthused. Refrains of Lagiacrus being "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jjkbni/comment/mjno4nj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peak</a>" and patient fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jjkbni/comment/mjnswza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrating their apparently successful manifestations</a> litter the comments sections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll get more details as we move past Title Update 1 and on towards the summer window for Title Update 2. But yes, it looks like Lagiacrus is going to lead the summer festivities in Monster Hunter Wilds, and that's some very exciting news for hunters new and old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it uses new eye-tracking technology and a lenticular lens to generate high-definition 3D images without the need for any eyewear. Samsung is currently working with partners like Nexon and Neowiz to showcase its abilities. If footage isn't designed for 3D, its AI video conversion tech can transform most 2D scenes into a 3D scene, ensuring you can use the monitor for a wide range of content.</p><p>Beyond 3D, the monitor offers all the other premium features you'd expect from a high-end device. This includes a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and 4K resolution. You'll also get AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync for tear-free gaming. And if you're a fan of ambient lighting, the monitor is equipped with Edge Lighting that illuminates the space around the monitor based on the on-screen action.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/ ">Odyssey OLED (G81SF)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/ ">Pricing TBD | Release date TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Available in 27-inch and 32-inch formats, the Odyssey OLED (G81SF) is all about image quality. Samsung notes that the 27-inch model offers the highest pixel density (166ppi) among any of its 27-inch monitors, making it a brilliant choice for discerning gamers. The 4K resolution supports a blistering 240Hz refresh rate, VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 for vibrant colors, and a glare-free coating to limit refractions from nearby light sources.</p><p>A 0.03ms response time makes it ideal for gaming, as does support for both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync. The screen isn't the only good-looking part of the monitor, as its slim metal frame and various built-in lights should make it a premium companion for your gaming room.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/">49-Inch Odyssey G91F</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/monitors\/get-it-first\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Bs9ZhlULz2w&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.samsung.com/us/monitors/get-it-first/">Pricing TBD | Release date TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><span>There are already a lot of 49-inch gaming monitors on the market, but Samsung is looking to bring "curved ultrawide gaming" to a larger audience.

Paradox Interactive has announced a further delay for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>. The Chinese-Room-developed action-RPG sequel will no longer meet its previously announced "first half of 2025" release window and is instead now aiming to launch in October this year.
</p>
<p>
"Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date," Paradox explained in a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/updated-release-window">post on the Bloodlines 2 website</a>. "The game is currently in a late development stage, and feedback from the community has been taken into account during this time. The Chinese Room is working hard on quality assurance to ensure it is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience."
</p>
<p>
"Bloodlines 2 will launch in October 2025 when the game meets the technical quality standards that you, our fans, rightfully expect and deserve", Paradox added in its statement, noting an exact release date will be shared at a later date.

<p>
Today's news marks a second delay for Bloodlines 2 under The Chinese Room's stewardship, after its release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-continues-paradoxs-delay-streak-now-launching-next-year">moved out of its original "late 2024" launch window</a> into the "first half of 2025". At the time, Paradox said the game was in "a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window", but that pushing it back would "create a quality assurance buffer" and give The Chinese Room time to "prioritise polish".
</p>
<p>
Paradox has, of course, faced a string of high-profile development disasters in recent years, leading to CEO Fredrik Wester's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">candid admission last October</a> that, "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects... and this must change." Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-says-it-almost-cancelled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-earlier-this-year">almost cancelled under its previous studio</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">The Chinese Room took over the project</a>, while 2023's The Lamplighters' League was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">enough of a flop</a> that Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">opted to part ways with its developer Harebrained Schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Paradox has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">cancelled its Sims-like Life By You</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">indefinitely delayed Prison Architect 2</a>, and struggled to deal with the fallout from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">catastrophically premature launch</a>. The city builder sequel's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">troubled console version still appears to be some way off</a> following developer Colossal Order's admission it was struggling to overcome "hardware limitations" - despite having originally been targeting a 2023 release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-of-road-preview-different-take-on-japanese-history<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadow of the Road</em> is an upcoming tactical, turn-based RPG from Another Angle Games. Set in an alternate version of 19th-century Japan, you’re pitted against an Emperor who has embraced outside influences and aims to destroy the Shogunate. Interested in the blend of steampunk weaponry and myth, I took part in a gameplay presentation and hands-on preview of the alpha.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Shadow of the Road Preview - Steampunk vs. Samurai Showdown</em></h2>

<p>You begin playing as two ronin in this traditional Japanese setting, where hints of steampunk weaponry from the West have invaded the land. That’s the overarching story of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>, Civil War. The Emperor has declared the end of the Shogun, using fierce weapons like flamethrowers to take out his enemies. The Shogun don't just lie down and die, however, as they recruit all warriors, even Ronin, to face the Emperor.</p>

<p>During the war, layers of personal missions, mystical experiences, and character developments impart additional tiers of narrative. Additionally, there are tie-ins with mythology, giving the title further story layers to discover. During your explorations, you can encounter yokai, who are both friendly and aggressive. While the spirits are based on Japanese lore, they are modified to fit the alternate world built by Another Angle Games.&nbsp;</p>

Medicinal items, like reishi mushrooms, are found throughout the land. These are important in keeping you alive in tough battles. Lootable items are marked with a pillar of falling blossoms making them easy to distinguish and collect. This is great for those who have issues picking out items in a realistic setting.</p>

<p>When it comes to the tactical part of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, I played through three different combat scenarios. The first is your basic tutorial combat. This mainly involves how to break an enemy’s concentration, destroy cover, attacks of opportunity, and shifting. I really enjoyed how the timeline displays turns for the whole battle, not just a single round.&nbsp;</p>

Even as a tutorial, you can lose the game if Akira or Satoru dies. Initially, I thought if one of them survived the game would continue. But I was wrong and soon the game over graphic was on my screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following combats were completely different, tactics-wise. In the second, you're tasked with protecting a young boy and fending off multiple waves of enemies. In the third, you face fire, a yokai, and exploding eyeballs. By the end of the battle, almost my whole field was an inferno. I drastically had to change how I moved my party to try and avoid getting burned, making the fight more drawn out than I would've liked. However, none of my units fell, and I was able to utilize some new ranged options I acquired in the skill tree.&nbsp;</p>

Not only do I want to learn more about how yokai appear and potentially partner with humans, but I also want to know more about these characters. How do the choices you make ultimately impact the story later on in the game?</p>

<p>These all have me wanting to fully explore the world of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>. I want to see how my choices change characters throughout the story. I want to see how yokai further alter combat and what they add to the traditional samurai combat experience.&nbsp;</p>

The new Onyx dark mode is part of a number of UI <a href="https://discord.com/blog/player-release-q12025">updates to the Discord desktop app</a> that make it closely match the mobile version of the app, alongside a much-improved overlay.</p><p>The Onyx dark mode is also joined by a Dark theme in the Discord desktop app, so there are now four options in total for free users. Discord has made the channel list resizable, improvements to overall spacing throughout the app, and there’s a new bar in the call interface that makes it easier to see if you have your microphone enabled and if your camera is on or off.</p><p>Discord has also tweaked the colors and illustrations throughout its desktop app as part of this refresh. “All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,” says Peter Sellis, senior vice president of product at Discord.</p><p>While the UI improvements are immediately obvious, Discord has also added a new game overlay to its desktop app that no longer hits your frame rates. “Previously, the Overlay worked best by ’“hooking’” itself directly into your game’s window, sacrificing game performance in the process,“ explains Sellis. ”This new version of the Overlay delivers a snappier, faster experience, focused around what you care about most.“</p><p>Discord has implemented individual widgets in its overlay, much like Microsoft’s Xbox Game Bar or the separate sections of Steam’s overlay. You can now watch Discord streams directly inside this overlay, so they can float above the game you’re playing. All of these new widgets can also be placed wherever you want them on a screen, and this updated overlay should also work with a lot more games and not be picked up by anti-cheat engines.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You would think that with a game that is pretty much all about driving like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, the prospect of an update that promises "endless" driving wouldn't be all that exciting or interesting. In this case you'd be wrong, though, as the game's upcoming Endless Expeditions patch sounds like a pretty solid one. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ironwood-studios">Ironwood Studios</a> revealed the update with a new trailer yesterday, showing off all the changes and additions coming to the game, the most notable one being expeditions, described as "new continuous drives" that are a bit more dangerous than you might be used to.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Outside of offering "unique rewards", Ironwood kept quiet on what this new mode will be like, but that makes the mystery of it all the more intriguing, no? On top of that there's also a few quality of life improvements coming. There's a new feature called cluster spawning, though I couldn't tell you what that is right now. The thermal vacuum and plasma scrapper are seeing some improvements too. As well as all that, a new zone trader, Ida's Exchange, can be discovered too.

<p>
A suspend run feature is being added in too, meaning if you need to quit out of the game because you realised you forgot to file your taxes or something, you can save mid-trip and go do that without sacrificing progress.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's more cosmetics you can unlock for your garage, more than an hours worth of new music to listen to on the radio while you're on the aforementioned endless expeditions (and anywhere else), and more lore too - Ironwood described this one as their "biggest" update yet, unsurprisingly.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the update either, as it's due out in a little over a week's time on April 3rd.

If you play without any assists, you won’t get objective markers or clearly defined tasks. Instead, you’ll need to suss out things entirely on your own, figuring out where leads are asking you to go by following written clues and your own intuition.</p><figure id="" data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-recommend-id="image://a724042b5754c9144eae1670b2547476" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options for Atomfall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this doesn’t sound up your alley, that’s totally okay! <strong>You can make the game feel a bit more forgiving by heading into Options &gt; Game &gt; Playstyle and turning on various assists.</strong> You can even set it up so that there are waypoint markers and hints.  This dramatically reduces how much additional work you’ll need to put into figuring out how to navigate Atomfall’s sprawling world.</p><h2 id="h4493"><a id=""></a>Thorough exploration is the key to your success</h2><p>Regardless of how you’ve customized your playstyle, exploration remains among the most significant parts of <em>Atomfall</em>. You’ll need to check every nook and cranny of the post-nuclear English countryside for leads that will direct you to side-quests, helpful crafting materials to improve your survivability, and all-important Training Stimulants and skill manuals to bolster your skill tree.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-recommend-id="image://b7160c92e8b56b285eab5114fcb05795" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player comes across a Training Stimulant in a dark environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a lot of these things are easy to miss, so thorough observation remains key. Check for spots you can climb over or under to reach hidden rooms, and thoroughly examine every desk, shelf, and box in an area so as not to miss anything. Even just finding a few extra bullets or a piece of food can make all the difference in a game where resources are so scarce. </p><h2 id="h4494"><a id=""></a>Stealth is your friend</h2><p>Ammo is hard to come by in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll spend a lot of time in melee combat. However, this means that facing off against tons of foes at once can be extremely overwhelming. <strong>When you’re trying to conserve ammo (or simply don’t have any), you’ll want to resort to stealth.</strong> Sneaking around an enemy encampment while slowly taking out unsuspecting foes and looting their goodies keeps more ammo in your magazines and more health in your, uh, health bar. </p><figure id="" data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-recommend-id="image://6ffc0db114ca364e08998a4abc90f8ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player sneaks up on a robot from a distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re not prepared with adequate resources when all hell breaks loose, though, just run far away and try again later. There’s no shame in regrouping and taking things slowly in a game designed around tense survival mechanics. Your goal is to live to see another day, after all.</p><hr><p><br><em>Atomfall</em> is available on March 27 for PS5 PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can follow along with the quests given to you by various NPCs, or you can choose to slaughter everyone in your path and figure things out for yourself. Moreover, the game doesn’t do a lot of hand-holding, so you’ll need to spend a lot of time paying close attention to details,studying your environment to find important items and locations. </p><p>All of this freedom helps make the overall experience of <em>Atomfall</em> fairly unique for each player. As such, each person’s playtime will differ based on how they approach the story and the options available to them. Because choices and ingenuity play such a large part in how long the game can last, it’s somewhat difficult to say exactly how long it will take someone to beat. </p><p>Generally speaking, though, if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t venture too far off the beaten path and plans to just focus on pushing through the narrative beats of the game, <strong>you’re likely to get anywhere from 10-20 hours out of your journey through <em>Atomfall</em></strong>—again, largely depending on which choices you make along the way.</p><figure id="" data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rebellion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-recommend-id="image://b757d9e24cd7a292e322363fae5a1fa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds a mine detector while walking through an overgrown wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, if you’re looking to see and do everything <em>Atomfall</em> has to offer, you’ll be able to squeeze quite a lot more out of this post-apocalyptic outing. Doing as much as possible in a single run can easily score you many, many more hours of gameplay than a strictly narrative-focused outing. And <strong>if you’re looking to grab every trophy/achievement in the game, you’ll need to beat it various times while following different paths</strong>. You’ll even be rewarded for finding a way to complete the game in under five hours!</p><p>There’s a ton of replay value in <em>Atomfall</em>, so you’ll be able to play through it as many times as you’d like while always seeing something new. This choice-driven, post-nuclear survival game is available on March 27 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-gets-esrb-rating-suggesting-launch-might-be-near/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 had been rated by the ESRB. In that article, I predicted it would be released within six months, as most games rated by regulators do. Today, Paradox Interactive has unveiled that's exactly the timeframe they have in mind, as the long-awaited roleplaying game sequel is now scheduled to launch in October.</p>
<p>The message was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzc1Ow18qhY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered</a> by Marco Behrmann, Executive Vice President of the World of Darkness IP (and Executive Producer on Bloodlines 2), who explained that the game is essentially done with only polishing left to do. Here's the full statement:</p>
<p><em>Since our last update, we have added more content to the game more narrative depth character development and we have also evolved Fabien's role in the storyline. Over the past couple of months we have invited you all to see the development of Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 in the form of <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diaries</a> focusing on various areas from the game including the Camarilla, the Anarchs, the Hunters, and many many other things. I implore you to check it out, and learn more about the game. The status of the game right now is that the game is done.</em></p>
<p><em>We are currently focusing on bug fixing,&nbsp; stability and performance so that we can deliver the best experience to you guys once it releases. Bloodlines 2 will release in October this year.</em></p>
<p>It also looks like PC Gamer was the first publication to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-first-hands-on-a-gory-undead-power-fantasy-that-im-desperate-to-play-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get hands-on with a preview build of the game</a>, and their report is quite enthusiastic, minus some concerns, such as dialogue animations that need to be polished. They also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-have-typical-rpg-romantic-relationships-but-it-will-feature-romantic-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers, revealing that the game would feature 'romantic feeding' rather than relationships, as confirmed by Creative Director Alex Skidmore:</p>
<p><em>So there are some romantic options. But vampire romance isn't the same as human romance. So we have—this is probably awful and I don't want to give this soundbite—a kind of romantic feeding. So there are points with named vampires where if you have played your card rights, you can do a romantic feed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A vampire's bite in VTM is called 'the kiss', so the humans don't scream, and they're left afterwards sort of dazed, and probably when they snap out of it they'll go, 'That was awesome. Where did that person go?' So that's the romanticism, whereas we didn't have that for the combat feeds. We want the combat feeds to be lethal, horrible.</em></p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october-2025.1144344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed yet again. It's now set to come out later this year.</p>

<p>In a new development update trailer,&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness&nbsp;</em>executive VP Marco Behrmann reveals that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>won't be meeting its previously-announced release window; the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">set to come out in the first half of this year</a>.</p>

<p>However, the two aforementioned studios believe that "ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date", and so they've admitted that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>"will not be ready for release" before the fall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=Lzb2Q_8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=a7cfqcn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again. Who'd have thunk?</figcaption></figure><p>According to Behrmann, however, the game is "done", and The Chinese Room and Paradox are currently focusing on bug fixing and testing, placing&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>in a "late development stage".</p>

<p>The developer is apparently currently working to "ensure [<em>Bloodlines 2</em>] is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience", hopefully guaranteeing that the game "meets the technical quality standards that [fans] rightfully expect and deserve".</p>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in October 2025, although Behrmann stopped short of announcing a new release date for the game. The wait goes on, it seems.</p>

<p>In case you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has a very long and arduous development history. The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2019</a>, at which point original game writer Brian Mitsoda was set to return.</p>




<p>After numerous delays, Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-kicks-out-narrative-designer-brian-mitsoda" rel="nofollow">removed from the project</a>, and its future was relatively uncertain until the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">returned in late 2023</a>, now being developed by <i>Dear Esther&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room.</p>

<p>We can only hope that this new release window for&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is accurate, but given the game's long and storied history, I will believe that when I see it. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Please, please, please keep an eye on Fortnite in the immediate future, as pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter appears to be heading to game soon. The breakout musical artist will seemingly be the next face in the massive roster of characters and real-life people to become playable Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-have-you-ever-tried-this-one">Have You Ever Tried This One?</h2>



<p>The Fortnite leakers are the first to report Sabrina’s seemingly imminent arrival. Multiple leakers have claimed that Sabrina Carpenter is likely the next to arrive, and the @FNBRintel account <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1903101976147095629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> last week that an inside source confirmed that the “next Fortnite Festival artist is female.”</p>



<p>Another Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR, posted today that some Sabrina-themed cosmetics have appeared in the game files already. This includes a glittery microphone with a heart-shaped base and a red, sequined heart-shaped sticker that she regularly uses.</p>



<div><article><p><span>SABRINA CARPENTER IS THE NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST 🔥

Fortnite accidentally added some of her cosmetics to the files earlier than intended! </span></p></article></div>



<p>Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, and The Weeknd have all been featured as the primary Icon in each season of Fortnite Festival. The rhythm game developed by Harmonix, developers of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, launched in Fortnite in December 2023. Each season features its own seasonal pass complete with songs, poses, and instruments related to the season’s Icon. Each Icon typically releases with playable outfits that can be used in various other games modes, like Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sabrina’s more risqué poses from her performances of “Juno” make it into the game remains to be seen. But a number of her most iconic songs should be playable in Fortnite Festival. Almost certainly, “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” will be featured, with one or both likely to be outfitted into an emote. The current Fortnite Festival season, featuring pop idol Hatsune Miku as the Icon, is scheduled to end on April 8th.</p>



<p>Will Sabrina’s arrival in Fortnite Mountain Dew it for you? Let us know down in the comments below! Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

You'll have to be HR 50 or above to challenge it, and new armor awaits those who can clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoh Shia is also getting its own fight. Previously, you'd only fight Zoh Shia once, as part of the main story. With the new update, you'll be able to re-fight Zoh Shia through new quests after reaching HR 50, and craft new armor from it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arena Quests</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunners get their own challenge to tackle in Arena Quests, which will allow hunters to compete for the fastest clear times. Both Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests will be available, with pendants given out for participation and achievement alike. You can access them through the counter in the new Grand Hub.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Change Alma's Outfit</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hardest-working handlers around is finally getting some cosmetic options. You'll be able to change Alma's attire through an appearance menu in camp, and one new outfit is being given out for free. After completing a certain side mission, you can also change out Alma's glasses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-21-1742913507424.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More DLC is on the way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of free and paid DLC is arriving in tandem with Title Update 1. Some additions, like some classic gestures from Monster Hunters prior, will be made freely available for hunters in the store. Others, like those in the Cosmetic DLC Pack 1, are available through the store, or for those who picked up the Cosmetic DLC Pass or Premium Deluxe Edition. New stickers, looks for Alma, and even more are on the way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-23-1742912586790.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More Event Quests and Seasonal Events</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more Event Quests are on the way, alongside Seasonal Events. The latter are special windows of time where the Grand Hub will change appearance, and available meals will also change. LImited equipment, gestures, decorations, and more are available during these Seasonal Events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seasonal Events kick off with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on April 23, adding pink cherry blossoms and some new decor to the game. Capcom confirmed that most previously available events and Event Quests should return in the future, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Roadmap Ahead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-24-1742912549128.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's how Title Update 1 and its related content will roll out over the coming months.
