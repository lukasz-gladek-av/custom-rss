It isn't a retro-throwback like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pixel Perfect</a> or a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chaos Vault</a> drop. No, this is a <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair, bringing one of the most iconic cartoon characters in the world to the popular card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://collider.com/spongebob-magic-the-gathering-special-secret-lair-images/" rel="nofollow">Collider</a>, the Spongebob Secret Lair will be broken up into three different drops. Each of these drops will be available for purchase on March 24 in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $ 39.99) bundles respectively.</p>

These cards are reimaginings of classic Magic: The Gathering cards. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Jodah, the Unifier</em> as "Spongebob Squarepants"</li>
	<li>Charix, the Raging Isle as "Mr. Krabs, Penny Pincher"</li>
	<li><em>Skrelv, Defector Mite</em> as "Plankton, Tiny Tyrant"</li>
	<li><em>Granzilaxx, Illithid Scholar</em> as "Squidward, Sarcastic Snob"</li>
	<li><em>Toxril, The Corrosive</em> as "Gary, The Snail"</li>
	<li><em>Barktooth Warbeard</em> as "Patrick Star"</li>
	<li><em>Toski, Bearer of Secrets</em> as "Sandy Cheeks, Martial Astronaut"</li>
</ul><p>The reskin choices here are humorous. Gary The Snail as a 7/7 creature that can spawn snail tokens and drop poison tokens is such a jarring departure from the lovable mollusk. Patrick Star is just a 6/5 creature with just the flavor text, "I don't get it..." which is spot on.</p>

This drop features classic Magic cards with Spongebob artwork inspired by internet memes. Counterspell showing Spongebob in a mocking chicken pose. Night's Whisper sporting a close-up of Squidward's face with bloodshot eyes. If you've been online long enough, you've seen these images.</p>

As the name implies, this drop contains a number of land cards sporting locations from Spongebob's underwater home of Bikini Bottom courtesy of artist Jon Vermilyea.</p>

<p><em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> is the longest running children's cartoon on Nickelodeon. Debuting in 1999, the show has run for 15 seasons alongside five animated feature films.</p>

We’ll have to wait until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">April 2nd to find out if Nintendo is fixing the issue with the new Switch 2</a>, but as iFixit discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjGaEMXa3mQ">during a teardown of the Alarmo alarm clock</a>, the company is already embracing more reliable Hall effect sensors in at least one of its devices.</p></div><p>Unlike disassembling most modern smartphones, iFixit’s teardown of Nintendo’s Alarmo appears to be relatively painless.

Below its 2.4-inch LCD screen, you’ll find the 24GHz mmWave presence sensor the alarm clock uses to detect your body movements and whether you’re sleeping through an alarm.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass.1130499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest season of Rocket League is on the horizon, as announced in a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-18-springs-forth-futura-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a>, and is set to begin on March 14 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 4 PM GMT. There are a lot of new changes coming with this approaching season, with a focus on a futuristic theme in the Futura Garden Arena, as well as other high-tech items that you can get to customize your car.</p>
<p>With a new season comes a new season pass, where you will automatically unlock the Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack Car Body. If you purchase the Rocket Pass, you'll also be able to obtain the Azura Car Body, Space Tower Antenna, Spaceship Topper, and Waypoint Trail. Those who log in during Season 18 will also unlock the Future Fashion Banner.</p>
<p>One of the major changes in this new Rocket League season is the new mutators that will be available to use in Exhibition Mode and Private Matches. Below is the full list of mutators that you'll be able to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumps - From a double jump to an octuple jump, or no jumps allowed at all, the decision is yours.</li>
<li>Number of Balls - you can choose to have one, two, four, or six balls in play.</li>
<li>Ball Gravity - Options include low, high, super, and default gravitational pull.</li>
<li>Dodge Timer - Change the dodge timer.</li>
<li>Possession Score - Players can earn points by keeping possession of the ball.</li>
<li>Normal Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each goal.</li>
<li>Aerial Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each successful airborne goal.</li>
<li>Assist Score - Players can earn up to three points for each assist.</li>
<li>Enforce Territories: This mutator enables the Split Shot Wall, which dives teams across each half of the field. Those that touch the ground of the opponents' side of the field will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-16-out-now-adds-improved-post-demolition-camera/">demolished</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever been in an intense Rocket League match and thought you scored a goal, but you were off by just a hair, a new ping sound will echo throughout the arena. This will happen if the ball hits the crossbar or goal posts to ensure that you don't lose momentum and start celebrating too early.</p>
<p>To make sure that the game is being kept safe for the decent people of Rocket League, player reporting is now being expanded to include voice reporting. This means that as well as being able to block, mute, and report other players, you'll now be able to submit audio evidence if you suspect that they are violating the Community Rules. For those concerned about what that means for them, there is a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/voice-reporting-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed FAQ</a> that explains everything you need to know.</p>

It claims the new device will be an Xbox-branded PC gaming handheld from an existing OEM and that it’s codenamed “Keenan.” It’ll have an official Xbox guide button and is currently planned to launch later this year, with the successor to the Xbox Series X/S generation of consoles greenlit for a planned launch as early as 2027. Notably, it sounds like it’ll be a single next-gen console, with the current Series S potentially subsumed by the handheld if it’s successful. <br></p><p>The report also claims that the next generation of controllers might feature “direct-to-cloud connectivity.” It’s believed the Microsoft’s work with generative AI and the existing Windows platform for PC will both play a greater role in Xbox’s future as well. This dovetails with recent signals from the company’s top leadership. </p><p>Last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said the company was exploring a gaming handheld but that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-pc-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-game-pass-1851697278?_gl=1*1k4yknd*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTYzMTc2Ny40Ni4xLjE3NDE2MzQxMDMuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-pc-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-game-pass-1851697278?_gl=1*1k4yknd*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTYzMTc2Ny40Ni4xLjE3NDE2MzQxMDMuNTcuMC4w">a finished product was still a couple of years out</a></span>. It’s possible that’s still the case, and that this 2025 “Xbox-branded” handheld is considered more of a half-step in that direction. Earlier this year at CES 2025, Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of “Next Generation,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Verge</em></a></span> the company was the aiming to bring the “best of Xbox and Windows together” for future PC gaming handhelds, seemingly through a new gaming-centric OS or OS layer that could compete more directly with SteamOS. </p><p>These moves come as rumors swirl about Sony working on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119?_gl=1*1vmm1ea*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTYzMzMwNC44OC4xLjE3NDE2MzUzMzUuNTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119?_gl=1*1vmm1ea*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTYzMzMwNC44OC4xLjE3NDE2MzUzMzUuNTQuMC4w">bringing back its own line of gaming handhelds</a></span> and with Nintendo’s Switch 2 just on the horizon. This time around, however, it doesn’t seem like Microsoft plans to fight the competition with exclusives. The company started bringing its games to PlayStation 5 and the existing Switch last year, and its more powerful specs suggest we’ll see even more Xbox games on Switch 2. Microsoft also previously committed to start bringing <em>Call of Duty </em>back to Nintendo’s platform in one form or another. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-ai-use/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-ai-use/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new leak has shown that Sony is working on AI-driven characters from some of its PlayStation franchises. </p>



<p>The leak, which was originally shown to The Verge but is now public shows Horizon Forbidden West’s Aloy talking and responding to someone asking her questions. You can watch the footage below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Playstation horizon sony AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-RJ7O9Tqf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As expected, the quality of the AI-powered character isn’t no where near the quality of having a team of developers working on it. But, as that hasn’t stopped Sony from hyping it up in a presumably behind-the-scenes presentation that went public.</p>



<p>As said by director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, the footage is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>While it’s clearly not up to par with traditional development methods, Sony’s exploration into AI is likely going to turn a lot of heads in the industry, especially for developers. As pointed out by The Verge, almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a>&nbsp;said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision faced criticism for its blatant use of AI imagery for its marketing</a> (and bad ones at that), with the community criticising the lack of effort. </p>



<p>It’s clear that AI isn’t going to go away and there’s still important conversations to be had in its role in game development, but some of the current use cases are becoming very questionable, especially when it comes to video games and the art form.</p>



<p>What do you think of AI and its use in video games? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Raghoebardajal demonstrates an AI-powered version of Aloy that can hold a conversation with a player through voice prompts during gameplay.</p><p>Aloy can be seen responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements, both in a demo setting and within the full <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> game. Raghoebardajal makes it clear this is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate the technology internally at Sony.</p><p>The technology demo uses OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text, and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations and decision making. Sony’s has its own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system that it uses for speech generation, according to Raghoebardajal, and audio to face animation is powered by Sony’s own Mockingbird technology.</p><p>While the demo is seen running on PC, Sony has also experimented with running parts of this technology directly on PS5 consoles with “little overhead,” according to Raghoebardajal. Sony first demonstrated this internally a year ago, before showing a more advanced version behind closed doors at its Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) in Tokyo in November.</p><p>“This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” says Raghoebardajal. This tech demo doesn’t answer the more obvious questions over whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when you’re supposed to be playing as her in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the impact such a technology could have on voice actors and game developers.</p><p>Nvidia has been working on its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">similar technology for AI-powered NPCs</a> in games, where you speak freely to video game characters. Ace, as Nvidia calls it, has been demonstrated several times throughout 2024, and the GPU maker has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105681/nvidia-ai-ace-video-game-character-npc-covert-protocol">worked with Inworld AI</a> to create <em>Covert Protocol</em>, a playable tech demo of Nvidia’s AI game technology.</p><p>Microsoft has also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948454/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-developer-tools-inworld-partnership">partnering closely with Inworld AI</a> to eventually bring AI characters to Xbox, allowing game developers to use generative AI characters, storylines, and more. Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">created its own Muse AI model that generates gameplay</a>, designed initially for game developers to create a game environment for prototyping and ideating.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear among game developers and studios about how AI could impact the creative process of making video games, particularly when so many layoffs are impacting the gaming industry. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them.</p><p>Sony’s experiments with AI-powered PlayStation characters are bound to generate more conversation around the role of AI in video game creation, just ahead of GDC next week in San Francisco. We reached out multiple times to Sony for a comment on this leaked internal video, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If the internet has taught me anything, its that Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 are two games folks simply cannot get enough of, myself included. Fortunately, a newly-released, fan-made mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Village</a>, combines the two in a pretty spectacular way. With the Baldur's Village mod, Stardew players can add 20+ characters, six new locations, new shops, new items, and new events, all inspired by Baldur's Gate 3, to the popular farming sim.</p><p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," the mods description reads. "You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent."</p><p>After venturing up north, players will be greeted by an entirely new area occupied by several familiar faces, including Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, and everyone's favorite, blood-sucking aristocrat, Astarion. Currently, Astarion is the only new neighbor players will be able to romance, as he is the only one the team has finished designing heart events and gift preferences for. However, the team has confirmed that its next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline, followed by expanding world-building background stories and gameplay features.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4456696,1300-4456697,1300-4456698,1300-4456699,1300-4456700,1300-4456701,1300-4456702,1300-4456703,1300-4456704,1300-4456705" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"></figure><p>In order to get the Baldur's Village mod up and running, players will also need to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Modding API</a> (SMAPI), the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Valley Content Patcher</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portraiture mod</a>, all of which can be downloaded for free over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. Players already using Stardew Valley mods might already have these downloaded, as several of the game's most popular mods require SMAPI and the Content Patcher to run. Once the mod is installed, players need not worry about starting a new game to experience the Baldur's Gate bliss--the mod should seamlessly integrate the new content into existing save files.</p><p>Despite launching less than 24 hours ago, Baldur's Village is already proving to be a very popular mod, with nearly 90,000 views and 12,000 total downloads as of writing. Considering mods have played a pivotal role in keeping both Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 fresh and exciting for repeat players, the success of Baldur's Village is exciting yet hardly surprising.</p><p>Interested in more mod recommendations from GameSpot?

                <p>Directors Neil Druckmann and Alex Garland sat down for a wide-ranging and fascinating chat recently where they discussed their professional careers. There is some overlap, of course, as Druckmann's The Last of Us franchise and Garland's 28 Days Later are themed around a virus that leads to epic societal collapse. In the discussion, Garland said he's sure The Last of Us (2013) is better than 28 Days Later (2002), at least in terms of the writing.</p><p>"The Last of Us is better than 28 Days Later, or at least the writing is. I know what 28 Days is. I know what I did. I know what the process was," he said in an <a href="https://youtu.be/iJUab499PVA?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an interview for Sony</a>. "The thing about The Last of Us was I was like, 'Oh this is like so much more sophisticated and moving.' I'm not dissing 28 Days Later. It's a nice part of my life. But seriously, The Last of Us is on another level."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>28 Days Later was directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle and stars Cillian Murphy.

Microsoft is reportedly aiming to release its next-gen Xbox Series X/S successor in 2027, with a much-rumoured handheld Xbox arriving later this year.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">according to Windows Central</a>, which reports an Xbox Series X/S successor has been greenlit "all the way up to [Microsoft] CEO Satya Nadella" and is now "fully in production". The publication doesn't have much to share in the way of specifics, but it claims the new console is a "premium successor to the powerful Xbox Series X", and is currently slated for a 2027 release.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has, of course, already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed it's working on an Series X/S successor</a>, with Xbox president Sarah Bond last year saying - amid fan fears the company may be looking to abandon the console market - it was "invested in [its] next-generation road map" and "focused on... delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."

<p>
While 2027 is obviously still some considerable way off, Windows Central says Microsoft has other Xbox hardware plans due to reach fruition much sooner. The company is reportedly currently working alongside an unspecified "PC gaming OEM" to launch an Xbox-branded gaming handheld later this year. It's claimed the device is being developed under the codename Keenan, and will - according to Windows Central's sources - look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
The idea of an Xbox handheld is nothing new. Back in 2017, Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> revealed Microsoft had "roughly designed an Xbox handheld" in the past. However, he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">repeatedly returned to the subject over the last year</a>, fuelling speculation the project had been revived. When questioned about a potential Xbox handheld last November, Spencer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">suggested any such devices would still be a few years away</a>, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2 looming</a>, and reports suggesting Sony is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">working on its own handheld device in the form of portable PS5</a>, it might be Microsoft felt the need to accelerate its plans.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, Windows Central claims Microsoft is <em>also</em> internally developing its own Xbox gaming handheld, separate from this year's partner machine, which is due to release alongside its Series X/S successor and "several new controller options" in 2027.
</p>
<p>
All this comes after a 2024 that saw Microsoft's continued dedication to the console market repeatedly questioned, particularly following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">bring select first-party Xbox games to other platforms</a>. And while that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">multiplatform strategy is accelerating in 2025</a>, the company has been keen to reiterate its commitment to the Xbox hardware business - last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">announcing three new Xbox console variants</a> alongside talk of its next-gen plans.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on.1130421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the Community Shaders team has released a new major update to the Skyrim graphics framework mod. Following the introduction of features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physically Based Rendering</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skylighting, and dynamic cloud shadows</a>, Community Shaders version <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.0</a> adds support (through an add-on) for AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, delivering a 60-70% performance uplift for most users. NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, which was implemented a couple of months ago, was also improved, although it remains an older version since the most recent ones do not support DirectX 11. Moreover, neither Multi Frame Generation nor Reflex are currently supported due to issues that NVIDIA should fix on their end. On the other hand, AMD Anti-Lag 2 should be supported.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the Frame Generation feature automatically optimizes Skyrim in a similar way to the extremely popular Display Tweaks mod. Therefore, Display Tweaks is not recommended to be used in conjunction, although it is still supported. The modders also note, as our readers already know very well, that frame Generation works best when your computer can already run the game at around 60 frames per second. The frame rate is then doubled to 120 frames per second, providing reliable frame pacing. Because of this, the feature only enables itself on 120Hz and higher displays, although it can still be forcefully activated from the Community Shaders panel.</p>
<p>The new Community Shaders release also brings several other improvements to Skyrim, such as a new grass shading model and improved grass collision, a parallax shading fix, mipmap LOD bias for TAA/FSR/DLAA to deliver sharper textures, the latest transformer model for DLAA, tweaks to screen space global illumination, brighter skylighting with improved shading, improved wetness effects, and various tonemapping tweaks. There will be several graphics showcases of CS 1.2.0 on YouTube in the next few days, no doubt.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There could be an official Xbox-branded handheld out by the end of this year. A new report states that Microsoft is partnering with a PC gaming company, like ASUS or Lenovo, on the device, with a targeted launch in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="nofollow ">WindowsCentral</a>, the handheld is codenamed Keenan and will be similar in nature to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-windows-handheld-preorders-are-live-steamos-model-releases-in-may/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>--which will be the first device outside the Steam Deck family to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">run on Valve's SteamOS</a>. So, the Xbox-branded handheld will likely run on Windows, featuring the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. The report also states the system will likely sport an Xbox guide button and aesthetics that fit the Xbox ethos.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">Phil Spencer mentioned an Xbox handheld is a "few years out"</a> in November. (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-thinks-xbox-should-have-a-handheld/1100-6524107/">Spencer, for his part, has teased making an Xbox handheld</a> for a while now, too.) This longer-term plan lines up with the report of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">the next Xbox launching in 2027</a>. Basically, Microsoft plans to kick off the next generation with a Xbox Series X successor accompanied by an internally developed handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr">However, unsurprisingly, it's noted that this schedule could shift as Microsoft works on the future of the Xbox brand. For instance, WindowsCentral points to the Xbox-licensed handheld scheduled for this year to serve as sort of a test drive for Microsoft. There is also no specific details on the partnering company, which could also be Razer or MSI.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted Microsoft seeking comment on this report.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/">a Call of Duty leaker claimed the next Xbox is planned for 2026</a>. One aspect that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">Spencer has touched on is that the next Xbox hardware must be more innovative</a>.</p>

Mio, the angsty introvert of the duo, writes science fiction to cope with her difficult upbringing. Zoe, a bubbly fantasy writer, escapes into stories of dungeons and dragons to process her trauma. While playing Hazelight’s latest co-op adventure, I was curious how the action-platformer would spotlight both its leads’ fictions in its final levels, assuming it would no longer be alternating between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds. Would it take place in some kind of neutral world that wouldn’t show favor to either of its heroes? Could Hazelight maybe just hone in on one of their stories for simplicity’s sake? As it turns out, the studio didn’t take any of the easy options, and the result is an incredible display of the team’s technical skill and inventive game design.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,196789,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Split Fiction</em>, Mio and Zoe have been trapped in a virtual reality that extracts ideas from authors’ brains, to be packaged and sold by a tech corporation called Rader Publishing.

Structurally, they are identical, but where Mio sees buildings and gaseous planets in the distance, Zoe sees a magical forest. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s co-op gameplay requires communication and coordination, but it was all while occupying the same space. Now, because the level is rendered as both sci-fi <em>and</em> fantasy, some objects are only interactive for one player, while the other has to find some way to help them from their “side.” For example, something that appears as just a pushable box to Mio might be a bouncy mushroom for Zoe, something she can use to jump high enough to reach an objective. Or perhaps some flora in the fantasy world could appear as a computer terminal in the sci-fi one. <em>Split Fiction</em> mostly delegates puzzle-solving and combat roles by giving its characters different tools. In the final level, that division of labor becomes inherent in the world design. Mio and Zoe are occupying the same space, but only one of them can see the way forward at a time. It leads to silly moments like when Zoe has to swim to reach an objective and Mio can’t see how she’s floating above what—to her—looks like a chasm. These two worlds are rendered simultaneously, with both characters moving through their respective worlds, affecting the other, all without once showing any signs of performance trouble. It’s a clever way to give sci-fi and fantasy equal weight in the final push, but it doesn’t stop at one impressive technical feat.</p><p>As the simulation continues to fall apart, <em>Split Fiction </em>starts playing with the boundaries of everything you thought you knew up to that point. Hazards appear in Mio’s sci-fi world that she has to avoid by moving to the right side of the screen where Zoe’s fantasy story takes up space, then suddenly there’s an onslaught of enemies, aircrafts, and obstacles blocking your progress that requires both players to rapidly move between both levels, as you watch both characters and the worlds around them seamlessly shift from one genre to the other.</p><figure id="" data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>But it doesn’t end there</em>. After a brief boss fight with a kaiju version of Rader in the simulation’s home, Mio and Zoe are sent back to their respective worlds and all the rules you’ve been taught about how these intertwined worlds work go out the window. The splitscreen that was once just a dividing line to help both players navigate the world from their perspective becomes a chaotic obstacle you have to navigate. The bar in the middle of the screen rotates, pivots, and shifts in ways that constantly change the confines of both the sci-fi and fantasy worlds, exposing both players to different dangers and paths forward.</p><p>The split down the middle of your television becomes a weapon for your enemy to wield, depriving you of literal screen space where you can safely exist, moving the divide between both worlds to push you into the dangerous sides of your own creation. There’s a section where <em>Split Fiction</em>’s camera shifts to a top-down perspective, with the splitscreen spinning around like a carousel, exposing dangers from the fantasy world like piranhas, or science-fiction industrial grinders, and all you can do is frantically jump between worlds until Rader throws something else at you. It’s challenging and requires you to pull from your knowledge of every previous level to recognize hazards from one world and maneuver your way to safety in the other. <em>Split Fiction </em>manages to pull this off without a hitch, which is another incredible technical feat on top of being stunning gameplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something kinda poetic about an artless corpo having to wield Mio and Zoe’s created worlds to take them down because he’s incapable of imagining something of his own. The final boss fight, against Rader’s giant god form, is literally just him reaching into both of their stories and tossing whatever beast or machine he can in hopes that it might save his creation. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s final level is relentless, dragging both players between science and magic without a moment’s respite. Words don’t do it justice. Its visual splendor is mixed with clever and challenging game design, all tied in a tight thematic bow. It’s the kind of thing you can only experience to its fullest once, and I’m already miffed I’ll never get to experience the delight of playing it for the first time with my co-op partner, slackjawed and gobsmacked at how Hazelight pulled it off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week AMD launched FSR 4 alongside its first RDNA 4-equipped desktop GPUs. It's a drastic improvement over previous versions of the tech suite, introducing AI-powered upscaling that is only possible thanks to dedicated hardware on the new cards. It's an advancement that Sony's Mark Cerny is saying will come to PS5, albeit not until 2026.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>, Cerny was full of praise for AMD's FSR 4 release, saying that the upscaler surpasses the work Sony has done with its PS5 Pro-exclusive solution, PSSR. "And results are excellent, it's a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR," Cerny explained. "I'm very proud of the work of the joint team!"</p><p>Cerny says that FSR 4 will need to be backported to the PS5 Pro, essentially through a new version of PSSR that takes into account all the advancements AMD has made. Cerny says that for the most part the information the upscaler requires from a game will stay the same, which will make implementation by developers easier, but that it isn't as easy as supporting FSR 4 natively. This is due to the PS5 Pro having an entirely different architecture than RDNA 4, and thus not one that can support it fully like AMD's latest GPUs.</p><p>"RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in FSR 4," Cerny continued. "I'm definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability."</p><p>FSR 4 doesn't have the same performance gains as its previous iteration, in part due to the additional overhead required for the vastly improved results. Cerny, however, believes the PS5 Pro can still support these image improvements despite the much weaker hardware in the PS5 Pro, without requiring major re-architecture. "That is what we are targeting, and we believe we can achieve it," Cerny added.</p><p>Sony and AMD continue to collaborate on Project Amethyst, with its first major milestone coming with the release of PSSR. Cerny believes there's a lot more to come by working closely with AMD, especially when it comes to machine learning and ray tracing enhancements for future console hardware. "All I can say is stay tuned! There’s a lot of opportunity with our Amethyst collaboration, and we know that ray tracing is a huge part of the graphics future," concluded Cerny.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luffy-would-never-be-on-my-starting-five.1130382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is Monkey D. Luffy.&nbsp; He's 19 years old, neurodivergent as hell, and, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but he's gonna be king of the pirates. In <em>One Piece</em>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-just-read-1-025-chapters-of-one-piece-and-its-a-damn-1847671952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000+ ongoing manga</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-leading-into-one-pieces-historic-1-000th-epi-1848078095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episodic anime odyssey</a>, I’ve seen him overcome insurmountable odds <a href="https://kotaku.com/hasan-piker-one-piece-socialist-twitch-youtube-politics-1850295738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liberating islands from fascist marines</a> and imperialist oligarchs, and stomp out anyone who dare deride folks who fed him whenever his ship graced their shores. Although his ethos isn't a cypher to unravel, his basketball in a recent <em>One Piece</em> and Los Angeles Lakers collaboration clip is. Allow me to put my hands on the proverbial SportsCenter desk and give my take on Luffy’s b-ball skills and why he wouldn’t be in the Straw Hats’ starting five.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 28,&nbsp; <em>One Piece</em> and the Los Angeles Lakers released “a first-of-its-kind collaboration” during a game against the Clippers. The highlight of the event was a special anime featurette where Luffy donned the Lakers’ purple and gold jersey and played basketball. The thirty-second clip was sick as hell and has amassed 594,000 viewers on YouTube all losing their minds over how surreal it is watching Luffy balling for the Lakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LOS ANGELES LAKERS x ONE PIECE Collab Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfKwPIbycbg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But Luffy lacks fundamentals. Let's start with Luffy’s ball handling: Unsurprisingly, Luffy won the jump ball in his score-less handicap game against a group of nameless marines who’re auspiciously dressed in Dallas Mavericks jerseys. As we all know, Luffy ate the Gum-Gum fruit, allowing him to stretch his limbs to far greater reaches than Michael Jordan at the end of <em>Space Jam</em>, so having insane ups isn’t anything wild. What is wild is Luffy’s abysmal ball handling and security. Within moments of possessing the rock, it was swatted away with ease by a player flanking him at half court. Luffy doesn’t even make any movement toward the net before losing possession. That’s some embarrassing lack of full court awareness. What’s worse, the ball is about to go out of bounds within nine seconds of the game. Who let him cook?</p><p>Thankfully, Luffy locks the fuck in and puts his stringbean arms to use, clasping the ball with one hand, sliding through the Marine’s defense, laying up a shot off the glass, and dunking on his opps before cheesing at the courtside camera. Luffy’s dunk further emphasizes the aura from his score with a well-timed rafters sign hyping up the crowd, asking, “Who’s the king?” before he posterizes two marines. Although anime’s glorious king rose to the occasion, if this were a real basketball game, he wouldn’t be in the same area code of my Straw Hats starting five. I’d have kept him sat on the bench until the last quarter of the game to save the day like one of his battles.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s talk about my starting five. For sports-averse readers, a starting five are players coaches put out on the court who display a high amplitude for scoring, an impenetrable defence, and seamless chemistry. If I were in charge of the Lakers x <em>One Piece</em> collab, I would've capitalized off the concept to further elevate the big-game feel of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-demon-slayer-team-up-before-dodgers-cubs-play-tokyo-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime melding with sports</a> beyond Luffy soloing an entire team. While the Straw Hats are short five players to constitute an NBA-regulated team, let’s pretend those rules don’t apply (given Luffy’s Gum-Gum powers were allowed) for the sake of building my <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-playoffs-anime-ja-morant-chris-paul-basketball-1848900403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy anime basketball team</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Why draw the Straw Hats in Lakers jerseys and keep them on the bench?<span></span><a href="https://lakersnation.com/lakers-giving-out-shirts-posters-for-one-piece-night-against-clippers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">©Eiichiro Oda/ Shueisha ©Eiichiro Oda/Shueisha, Toei Animation ©Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.</a></figcaption></figure><p>My team needs a point guard who can pop off with laser beam shots from half court like it's nothing. No other player would fit this role better than the Straw Hats’ resident sniper, Usopp. Usopp never misses his target in the heat of battle, so his scoring ability coupled with his court presence and leadership makes him (or that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXNmMLdivk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper King</a> fellow) an ideal point guard to carry the game until we need to sub him out for Luffy.&nbsp;</p><p>As the senior officer of the Straw Hats crew with ample experience as a crew member on other ships and one of the seven warlords of the sea, Jinbe’s expertise and strategery overqualified him as my team’s shooting guard. What’s more, his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fish-Man_Karate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fish-man karate</a> would provide defensive versatility for our team on account of him moving enemies without touching them with blasts of air, and his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Haki/Armament_Haki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">armament haki</a> would give him enough space and durability for his wide-ass frame to get open for open shots.&nbsp;</p><p>The next player on my starting five would be the devil child herself, Nico Robin. Having eaten the <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hana_Hana_no_Mi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flower-Flower fruit</a>, a devil fruit that lets her sprout duplicates of her body on any surface within her range, Robin would be the center in my starting five. Her defensive presence would make for a wealth of scoring and rebound opportunities from virtually anywhere on the court, including off the enemy team’s body (which probably wouldn’t count as a foul).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, my Straw Hat’s small and power forward would be Sanji and Zoro. Sanji’s whole deal as the Straw Hats’ versatile cook makes him perfect for adapting to whatever task spontaneously asked of him. What’s more, he’d be able to handle mid-range shots supporting our point guard or ball-handling all with his fucking feet. That’s sick as hell. As our power forward, Zoro would basically be asked to do the same tasks as Sanji, with the only difference being him being the most dependable player. Seeing as how he took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAtZoIFW2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the brunt of Luffy’s pain</a>, he’s the only man strong enough to fulfill the role. Although the two don’t get along as well as Draymond Green and Jordan Poole on a good day, when push comes to shove, the pair are the most in sync of the entire crew. As “<a href="https://gamerant.com/one-piece-zoro-sanji-wings-of-the-pirate-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the wing’s of the pirate king</a>,” Sanji and Zoro come in clutch with rebounding off each other’s offensive and defensive attacks without communicating with one another.&nbsp;</p><p>What of the rest of the crew? Well, I’d have Nami serve as the coach since her role as the navigator basically makes her the closest thing to being the crew’s real captain. Her cheerleading and chastising would not only keep Zoro and Sanji (mostly Sanji) from butting heads, she’d also suss out the pattern of the enemy team’s plays and chart us towards victory. Chopper would be doctoring, naturally, with the option to sub in for Jinbe should he exhaust his armament haki in the first quarter of the game and need a breather. Hopefully his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Rumble_Ball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumble balls</a> won’t count as juicing up. Franky would also serve as a replacement for Robin or Sanji should they blow up in the first half of the game. Brook….can be our team’s Drake and cheer for us on the sidelines by singing or something. This isn’t because I don’t like the skeletal bard, I just think it’d be harder to justify his soul-swapping ghost ability on the enemy team as fair in this already ludacris rule breaking anime basketball game.&nbsp;</p><p>While Luffy is nice enough alone on the court, basketball is a team-based sport, so it’s weird the collab had him playing like LeBron James in the paint without his nakama by his side. If my Stephen A. Smith-esque analysis of Luffy’s skills and fantasy booking are anything to go on, the Straw Hats are a far cry from being as bad as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-cant-do-it-all-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017-era Cleveland Cavaliers</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-monster-hunter-wilds-streamlined"><h3>The New Monster Hunter Is The Most Streamlined Yet, But That’s Not Such A Bad Thing</h3></a><p>"I’ve played so many Monster Hunter games, and I don’t have time for the bullshit involved in Monster Hunter games"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.

			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios announced the release of a new premium DLC and free update for the PC/Mac version of the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online (consoles will have to wait a couple of weeks as usual).</p>
<p>The premium DLC is called Fallen Banners and introduces two new dungeons to the game: Lep Seclusa and Exiled Redoubt. In Lep Seclusa, the Moth Priests who inhabit the location are under siege, and the cunning Orpheon the Tactician is determined to seize the power of the Elder Scroll they guard. The Elder Scrolls Online players must help Sister Chana defend the sanctuary from an army of deserters, protect its people and secrets, and confront Orpheon before he can use the scroll's power to change the face of Cyrodiil forever.</p>
<p>In Exiled Redoubt, soldiers of the Alliance War (regardless of their faction) are disappearing, and all traces lead to the namesake Imperial fortress. In this case, players will team up with Battlemage Lucilla to infiltrate this mysterious stronghold and put an end to the plans of a once noble Imperial House before the chaos spreads beyond its stone walls and across Tamriel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players who succeed in emerging victorious Lep Seclusa and the Exile Redoubt will also have the chance to loot and unlock a host of special rewards, including new collectibles, item sets, and Achievements. These include the Tactician's Gold Grate Skin, which can be earned by completing both dungeons on Veteran difficulty.</p>
<p>Fallen Banners is currently available to active ESO Plus subscribers. However, there's also a free update, the game's 45th. ZeniMax Online Studios has introduced a visual overhaul to the Starter Zones (Bleakrock Isle, Bal Foyen, Stros M'kai, Betnikh, and Khenarthi's Roost), including improved lighting, improved ground and water textures, updated structures, and the addition of more clutter or props.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Update 45 adds much more, though, between various balance changes, the first stages of console add-on support (which is scheduled to go live in its entirety later this year), and new player response options when talking to story NPCs, in an effort to improve the roleplaying factor in dialogue. For the full patch notes, head over <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/674341/pc-mac-patch-notes-v10-3-5-update-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, earlier this year, ZeniMax <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls Online would switch from yearly Chapters to seasonal content. The studio has already scheduled an ESO Direct for April 10 where more information about what's coming this year will be unveiled.</p>

The dews of inspiration are like korok seeds; there’s ten and a half million of them and your best chance of finding them is through sheer luck and determination – i.e. impossible. </p><p>It kinda sucks that they’re so hard to find because dews can be exchanged for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">really cool outfits</a> that can help out if you’re stuck in one of the styling boss battles. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> community has clamored for the developers to put a tracking system for them in the game similar to the way your bi-pedal cat companion Momo can guide you to nearby whimstars. The developers have fulfilled other community wishes like expanding the number of outfit slots from four to seven (thanks!) and now they’ve answered this ask in a big way.</p><p>Visiting <a href="https://pearpal.infoldgames.com/en/home">this site</a> will grant access to an interactive map whereby you can finally locate all those damnable dews of inspiration. If you use your <em>Infinity Nikki</em> log in information, the map will be personalized to show what items you’ve picked up and what you’re still missing. Best yet, this map can be used for literally everything – missing treasure chests, secret clothing vendors, hidden caves, and more. It’s not as convenient as an in-game map would be but it updates in real time to make checking things off your list a little easier.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A bunch of playtester footage for the next, modern-day-set Battlefield game has slipped past EA's non-disclosure agreements and erupted all over social media. The footage stems from the company's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">Battlefield Labs community testing program</a>, and consists of multiple consecutive minutes of burly shootyfolks running down alleyways through showers of grit, firing very briefly at enemy troopers, and getting themselves bullet-bonked back to the lobby screen. 
</p>
<p>
EA had been taking the videos down, but have seemingly now decided to let them roll. It's the kind of tactical withdrawal in the face of overwhelming numbers that seldom occurs to me when I play Battlefield, because I always play Battlefield in the character of a movie extra. I am here to cultivate the ambience for other players by prancing around yodelling "INCOMING", not contribute to our victory.
</p><!--more-->
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
From the footage, we glean a few bits of information about the new game, which has yet to be formally revealed (or titled). In good news for people who hated Battlefield's specialist system, it looks like the old Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Medic classes are back. So are those picture-in-picture spawn select views that once allowed you to watch your squadmate running directly towards an enemy tank, then decide to spawn on them anyway. 
</p>
<p>
There are new squad animations for victory screens, which seem well-placed to help with sales of cosmetics. There's also the ability to drag downed team mates to cover rather than trying to defib them in a raging crossfire (see also: how I like to play Battlefield). And there are glimpses of the new destruction systems, with whole buildings falling over at the behest of rocket-propelled grenades.</p>
<p>If I have one request for nu-Battlefield, it's destruction physics of sufficient granularity and improbability that I can engineer really silly terrain traps. The tech has surely caught up with the blue sky thinking by now. I want to whittle buildings down to a single load-bearing doorway, then open it with a sniper bullet and drop the whole skyscraper on somebody's head. Less Spielbergian gravitas, more Looney Tunes, please!
</p>
<p>
The new Battlefield is the work of series creators DICE and long-haul Battlefield support studio Ripple Effect, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-have-delayed-need-for-speed-so-criterion-can-support-battlefield-6">together with Need For Speed outfit Criterion</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> rebooters EA Motive. Ridgeline Games were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">working on the campaign at one point</a>, but EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">closed them down</a>.

However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479256356608888107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479256356608888107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a></span> seems to give us our first look at New Vegas as it appears in the video games. You can see a rusty, cobbled-together sign that says “Welcome to the strip.” This is the nicer area of New Vegas in the video games, and getting in isn’t cheap. </p><p>Of course, it’s hard to discern much more from these shaky videos and leaks and we don’t know precisely how New Vegas will be featured in <em>Fallout’s </em>next season. But regardless, I’m excited to see such an iconic and famous piece of <em>Fallout </em>turned into real sets. <em>Fallout’s </em>dedication to real, hand-built sets and not just relying on CG backgrounds is something I really appreciated about season one, and it seems we’ll be getting more of that in season 2 when it arrives at some yet-to-be-announced date in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s all available to help make MAR10 Day feel a bit more special right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Lego Mario Kat Set Drifts Into Stores This May</h3><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! 🏆 Launching May 15th 🏁 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOSuperMario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOSuperMario</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKart</a> <a href="https://t.co/NZ13sCIFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1899083988142092785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo hasn’t been shy when it comes to adding more Lego sets based on its iconic cast of characters.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s "spring" arrival on PS5 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">been known for a good few months now</a>, but with the season of daffodils and egg box art now almost upon us, we might finally have a specific release date to chew on. According to ultra-reliable leaker Billbil-kun, The Great Circle comes to Sony's consoles on 17th April, with pre-orders set to open soon.
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun (who has an excellent track record with PlayStation leaks) claimed their "recent investigations" had revealed the Standard edition of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April. However, Microsoft is reportedly also releasing a Premium version - just as it did on Xbox and PC - granting two days early access, from 15th April. Billbil-kun says they were unable to confirm if a PS5 Collector's Edition is in the works.
</p>
<p>
Billbil-kun claims The Great Circle's Standard and Premium editions will both be available as a physical release, with prices reportedly matching their Xbox equivalents. That means £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 USD for the Standard edition on PS5 and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium release. Pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March in Europe.

<p>
"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames." And if you're somehow still on the fence after all the praise its received since its release, perhaps you might like to know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">we loved The Great Circle enough that it was named Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2024.</a>
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PlayStation 5 release follows Microsoft's decision last year to bring select first-party Xbox releases to other platforms. And after a tentative first 12 months - which saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-fi Rush make the jump to either PS5 or Switch - 2025 looks to be a busy one. Microsoft has already confirmed the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">Age of Empires 2</a>, Age of Mythology Retold, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-officially-heading-to-playstation-5-this-spring">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 are heading to PS5 - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Halo">Halo and Flight Simulator 2024 reportedly also on the way</a>.
