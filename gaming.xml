I’ve seen a few of the Michael Bay films but the <em>Transformers </em>craze mostly passed me by as a child. Even when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ramattra-reinhardt-bastion-transformers-1851582905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ramattra-reinhardt-bastion-transformers-1851582905"><em>Overwatch 2</em> had its collaboration</a></span> with the series I was unmoved despite over a thousand hours in that game. But Paramount has found a way to target me, specifically, as it rolls out its new animated origin story in theaters by crossing over with another big franchise film it has coming out this year: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-gerald-trailer-explained-1851632861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-gerald-trailer-explained-1851632861"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a></span>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193088" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Mini Sega Arcade Cabinet Packed With Retro Games Would Make A Great Gift" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="93" data-playlist="193088,196805,196001" data-current="193088"><div><p>This Mini Sega Arcade Cabinet Packed With Retro Games Would Make A Great Gift</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193088/193088_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193088/193088_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193088/193088_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193088/193088_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18548.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On September 20, the film’s opening day, the first 300 ticket holders at participating theaters will get an exclusive, apparently secret print from <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> featuring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-hedgehog-sonic-3-explained-adventure-2-gun-movie-1851639981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-hedgehog-sonic-3-explained-adventure-2-gun-movie-1851639981">Keanu Reeves’ Shadow the Hedgehog</a></span>. I have no particular interest in the plight of Optimus Prime and Megatron. I don’t know why those giant robots in disguise are fighting and am not terribly interested in finding out, unless I hear they’re going to kiss at some point in the film’s runtime. But what I do care about is a tragic, angsty, black-and-red hedgehog ready to destroy the world as revenge for the loss of his best friend. Sure, this print could be super lame, and it might even just be a printed screenshot from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-first-trailer-keanu-reeves-shadow-1851632082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-first-trailer-keanu-reeves-shadow-1851632082">the trailer Paramount released earlier this month</a></span>. But what if it’s actually sick art that will become a collector’s item that I want on my wall? I would be foolish to deny myself such an opportunity. The robot movie is apparently pretty alright, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transformers_one&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transformers_one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the reviews</a></span>, so it will probably be a decent time at the theater. Plus, I don’t even have to go see <em>Transformers One</em>. I just gotta buy a ticket and show up.</p><p>If you’re similarly Shadow-pilled and want to get whatever this print is, there’s a page on the <em>Transformers</em> movie website that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.transformersmovie.com/?date=2024-09-20&amp;chain=amc,regal-cinemas,cinemark-theatres,marcus-theatres,b-and-b-theatres,santikos-theatres,showcase-cinemas,cmx-cinemas,malco-theatres,studio-movie-grill,emagine-entertainment,mjr-theatres,picture-show-entertainment,galaxy-theaters,megaplex-theaters,premiere-cinemas,cinepolis-usa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.transformersmovie.com/?date=2024-09-20&amp;chain=amc,regal-cinemas,cinemark-theatres,marcus-theatres,b-and-b-theatres,santikos-theatres,showcase-cinemas,cmx-cinemas,malco-theatres,studio-movie-grill,emagine-entertainment,mjr-theatres,picture-show-entertainment,galaxy-theaters,megaplex-theaters,premiere-cinemas,cinepolis-usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lays out which theaters are participating</a></span>. 300 tickets sounds like a lot of people, but you still might want to go to one of the earlier showings just to be safe.</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>is coming to theaters on December 20, and there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-movie-trailer-reaction-keanu-reeves-shadow-amy-1851637185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-movie-trailer-reaction-keanu-reeves-shadow-amy-1851637185">a lot to unpack</a></span> in the first trailer.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br8_YASkfb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda has released</a> a deep dive into the Starfield: Shattered Space expansion.</p>



<p>Releasing September 30, Starfield: Shattered Space features over 50 all-new locations, new gameplay mechanics, enemies, and more. </p>







<p>In the nearly 10-minute deep dive, Bethesda goes into detail on the environments and features the new expansion will hold. </p>



<p>“From the minute you arrive on Va’Ruun’kai, the story never sends you off planet,” lead creative producer  Tim Lamb said. “You’re free to leave at any time, but the story’s fully centered around life on the Va’Ruun home world.”</p>



<p>“Everything you discover; every location you visit; every side mission you seek out, it all tells the story of what happened here, ” Lead producer Joe Mueller  says, “and how the Va’Ruun people have survived, cut off from the comforts of the settled systems and the rest of humanity.”</p>



<p>You can watch the full Starfield: Shattered Space deep dive for yourself below. And be sure to let us know your thoughts on the upcoming expansion in the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>! </p>

for AMD to apparently win the deal with Sony for the PS6--though keep in mind nothing has been officially announced.

AMD currently helps power PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. GameSpot has reached out to Sony for comment. </p><p dir="ltr">A redacted document that emerged when Microsoft was attempting to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2022 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-mentions-ps6-release-year-if-only-this-document-werent-redacted/1100-6509450/" data-ref-id="1100-6509450">pointed to PS6 possibly not releasing until 2028</a> at the earliest. This was deduced at that time from Sony arguing about Microsoft possibly making Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox after 2027.

For just $21, you’ll get an in-depth look at the history that inspired both games. Written by history professor Tore C.

The book has earned positive reviews from critics, and it’s an easy recommendation for fans of the series.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>The book covers a large portion of US history between 1870 and 1920, giving you an extensive look at the world that shaped Rockstar’s two iconic titles. Olsson is a professor of American history at the University of Tennessee, and he shares a wealth of information across the book's 288 pages, all of which relate back to the game’s characters, setting, and storyline. It wasn't written in collaboration with Rockstar, but it's still an excellent source of background info.</p><p>A sample is available for free on Amazon, giving you a chance to skim through a few pages before making your decision.

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cities: Skylines 2</a> was released in October 2023 and was due to receive some creator packs and a whole expansion, but they have all since been delayed, as Paradox and Colossal Order posted in a new Steam post. The Creator Packs named Modern Architecture and Urban Promenades are being pushed back to Q4 of this year, while the Bridges &amp; Ports major expansion will launch in Q2 of 2025 instead.</p>
<p>Compared to the first Cities: Skylines game, this one wasn't as well received and has a Mixed review rating on Steam. This predominantly comes from people who pre-ordered and still haven't received items they were promised to receive as a gift for pre-ordering. The game is also incredibly broken and bug-ridden. On top of that, they now have to deal with the delays of the new Creator Packs and significant expansion.</p>
<p>The delays are being made so that both Paradox and Colossal Order can focus on the upcoming Asset Editor, which is something else that players have complained about. They noticed a severe lack of custom assets, making the gameplay feel samey and rushed. Instead of focusing on the expansions, they are funneling all of their focus into the Asset Editor, which is described as being "one of the most crucial remaining features" for modding.</p>
<p>In addition, the studios are saying that the delays will allow them to make the game enjoyable for the community, which as stated above, is an ongoing concern, as the game launched with a myriad of issues that are still there, even today.</p>
<p>In addition to PC delays, Cities: Skylines 2 still isn't out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, adding to the community's increasing frustration. It seems the developers are spinning too many plates, as they have a significant amount of base content to work on before they can focus on the Creator Packs and expansion.</p>
<p>The one main issue that Colossal Order is set on fixing and making more enjoyable for players is the issue with hotels and tourism. They are also working on the various bugs and performance issues that those playing it are experiencing. The difficulty is another area that is deemed problematic, as it is seemingly unbalanced, regardless of what difficulty you are on. As a result, they are also working on this to try and make the game more balanced and playable in every aspect.</p>
<p>Although it's taking a while, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/7373044403862069994?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam post</a> gives the energy and impression that the developers care about the project and are putting fans' happiness at the forefront of their concerns.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next generation of Far Cry branded games is in the works, judging from a recent job ad from Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The job ad is for a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000004230907-3d-programming-team-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D Programmer Team Lead</a> who will be responsible for leading a team of 3D programmers in the development of the next generation of Far Cry-branded games. Unfortunately, this is everything the job ad says regarding the celebrated series, as the key responsibilities and required qualifications listed do not even provide hints on the technology that could power such games.</p>
<p>The future of the Far Cry series is pretty much unknown at this point, and everything we know about the seventh entry in the series comes from rumors. <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-rumor-non-linear-story-interrogations-timed-structure/">Last year</a>, the ever-reliable Tom Henderson revealed that the next entry in the franchise will feature a non-linear story involving the head of a wealthy family who has been kidnapped by the Sons of the Truth cult, and it will be up to the player how and when to save the members of the family. A time limit of 72 in-game hours, 24 real-world hours, will add to the experience, as do the narrative changes caused by the choices players make while attempting to save the kidnapped relatives. A second Far Cry project, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Maverick</a>, is also said to be in development, and these two could very well be the next-generation games mentioned in the job ad.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Far Cry 6. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/far-cry-6-anton-castillo-will-see-you-now/">review.</a></p>

The teaser’s shots of <em>Nocturne</em>’s heroes make it seem like season 2 will see them being haunted by memories of all they’ve lost. But the brief flashes of a cross engulfed in pink flames also feels like it could be a nod to the show bringing back certain characters like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson).</p><p>The teaser makes clear that as bleak as things have gotten for Richter and his allies, they still intend to slash down any monsters that cross their paths. And while Netflix hasn’t given the season an exact premiere date, we now know the show will return in January 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>What time is it on the Moon? NASA is trying to figure that out. Together with other global partners, the US space agency is launching a new effort to try to establish a coordinated time for the Moon. The aim is to create a Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) so everyone can be on the same page. Who knows, if people ever live on the Moon--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nasa-delays-plans-to-put-humans-back-on-the-moon/1100-6520208/" data-ref-id="1100-6520208">that is actually a real plan of the new Artemis program</a>--this could be important to know when the new Call of Duty comes out.</p><p>NASA's Space Communication and Navigation program is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/nasa-to-develop-lunar-time-standard-for-exploration-initiatives/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=NASA&amp;utm_campaign=NASASocial&amp;linkId=591102347" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taking point</a> alongside other members of the US government and "international standards organizations." How will they come up with a time?</p><p>NASA said it will be determined by a "weighted average of atomic clocks on the Moon." This is similar to how Earth's Coordinate Universal Time (UTC) is calculated. However for Coordinated Lunar Time, scientists have some additional issues to overcome.</p><p>"Exactly where at the Moon is still to be determined, since current analysis indicates that atomic clocks placed at the Moon's surface will appear to 'tick' faster by microseconds per day," NASA said. "A microsecond is one millionth of a second. NASA and its partners are currently researching which mathematical models will be best for establishing a lunar time."</p><p>NASA says this is a critical undertaking in part because the space organization aims to send humans back to the Moon in its Artemis program and to establish a "sustained presence" or and around the Moon.</p><p>"The approach to time systems will also be scalable for Mars and other celestial bodies throughout our solar system, enabling long-duration exploration," NASA said.</p><p>There is also a need for a time standard because the commercial space industry is growing quickly, and accurate and coordinated time-keeping is important for safe and sustainable journeys, NASA said.</p><p>In terms of the commercial space industry, just last week, SpaceX took astronauts higher into space than anyone has gone in 50 years and conducted the first commercial spacewalk. Billionaire Jared Isaacman paid his way and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/spacex-spacewalk-private-polaris-dawn-87d4c78853f0249baf29631bedfac749" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">completed the spacewalk alongside astronaut Sarah Gillis</a>.

            <p>Yes, Valve is still working on an anticheat for its new shooter, Deadlock.</p>
<p>A developer for Deadlock - the hero shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Valve wouldn't admit existed</a> even after it had hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">a concurrent player peak of over 16,000</a> last month - first confirmed on the game's Discord server that it was working on anticheat back on 11th August.</p>
<p>Since then, the development team has dropped several updates saying it "certainly considers [cheating] a very high priority in the long term", and had "a group of people working on anti cheat".</p>

<p>However, the game's reddit community has seen dozens of complaints from players, including one post yesterday that asserts one player encountered "three cheaters in a row today".</p>
<p>Consequently, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/valve-developer-has-to-keep-reminding-players-that-deadlock-s-anti-cheat-system-is-coming-and-very-high-priority-since-it-s-leaning-mostly-on-player-reports-right-now/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is relying on players to report cheaters manually via its Discord server.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1fhdbes/3_cheaters_in_a_row_today/">3 Cheaters in a row today</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarming_Still_5030/">u/Alarming_Still_5030</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/">DeadlockTheGame</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"If you think someone is cheating in the game, please report it in the #reports channel of the official Deadlock Discord by Valve," the moderation team explains.</p>
<p>"You can get the invite for it in the game's main menu. Cheat reports are quickly manually being worked on while an anti cheat is still being developed."</p>
<p>Deadlock reached a new peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">171,490 players</a> when it was finally announced at the end of last month. There is still no actual release date for Deadlock, however, and it can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">only be played via invite at the time of writing</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The new integrated mod manager for Baldur's Gate 3 has been highly successful, with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/">5.4 million downloads</a> in just four days.&nbsp;<span>Using the unlocked version of the official modding tool released by Larian Studios, a modder has created new areas for players to explore.

<p>Avernus is an area that is mentioned a huge amount throughout the game for different characters' storylines, and it was an area that players were desperate to see in-game. Avernus is the first layer of hell in the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse, but unfortunately won't ever be seen officially in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>This isn't a surprise to many fans, as Larian Studios confirmed a while ago that they are not working on any expansions for Baldur's Gate 3 or any follow-up game. As a result, the modding tool has been implemented to give players a new playground to have fun. The modding tool was added on September 9. Still, players have found a way to use an 'unlocked' version of the modding tool created by Larian Studios, which is exactly what is allowing katzenBurger to create new maps and locations for the game.</p>
<p>A video of the castle area and Avernus has been uploaded to YouTube, showcasing some of the area and detailing it. According to KatzenBurger, using the mod tool to make maps is incredibly easy, as it opens it up to other players trying to create their maps, too.</p>
<p><iframe title="baldurs gate 3 toolkit unlocked map test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Console players will now be able to enjoy the mods that are made using the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit exclusively. Still, for those made using the "unlocked" tool, it means that the console players won't be able to access them unless Larian decides to unlock the toolkit fully. However, it's unlikely that will be happening, as CEO Swen Vincke said in March that wouldn't be happening. Still, depending on how successful these mods are once they are full released, it could be a game changer for Larian Studios.</p>
<p>The toolkit was released as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was claimed to be the final update for the game. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-gets-more-details-ahead-of-its-september-launch-wont-be-the-final-update/">Larian Studios has confirmed that it isn't the final update</a>&nbsp;but doesn't want to talk about what is yet to come in future updates. However, the most recent update provided a lot of new variations, adding new Legendary Actions, 13 new cinematics for your evil playthrough, and Honor Mode improvements.</p>

You’ll encounter four you can work with: Pyke Syndicate, Ashiga Clan, Crimson Dawn, and Hutt Cartel. They all offer different jobs and unique rewards, and some of them affect the main story of the game. But you can’t make all of them happy.

Opportunities will arise during quests that force you to choose between two opposing organizations, and in doing so, the mission outcome varies along with its rewards. Some do prove better than others!<br></p><p>It’s also worth knowing that your reputation with any given faction will hugely change your day-to-day experience while playing, where entering their territory (whether on a planet or in space) might see you cautiously welcomed, or immediately fired upon.</p><p>Click next to start learning about all the game’s criminal syndicates.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-recommend-id="image://50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Criminal Network screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Criminal Network screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-recommend-id="image://50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Criminal Network screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Pyke Syndicate is this system’s most significant criminal enterprise, controlling territories on Toshara, Mirogana, Akiva, and Myrra.

An enormous version of the Stardew Valley title screen was built from LEGO and placed behind the model too.</p><p>Creator Steve Jensen told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/this-incredible-stardew-valley-lego-build-won-an-award-and-got-a-surprise-visit-from-concernedape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> the build took around two years to complete, and his favorite elements include the Hat Shop, "because I was able to make [it] almost entirely hollow, so you can look through the cracks and broken parts and see through to more such openings on the other side, just as a rundown, abandoned structure would be," Jensen said.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@beyondthebrick/video/7412313844158188830" data-video-id="7412313844158188830"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beyondthebrick?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@beyondthebrick" rel="noopener noreferrer">@beyondthebrick</a> Huge LEGO Stardew Valley by Steve Jensen <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lego?refer=embed" title="lego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#lego</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stardewvalley?refer=embed" title="stardewvalley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stardewvalley</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7412313818623986462?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Beyond the Brick" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Beyond the Brick</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>"Another fave is the Wizard's Tower. I was able to get the shape I wanted, including a peaked door, and vines growing up the sides, the cone-shaped roof in blue, everything."</p><p>The effort certainly impressed the LEGO community as the Stardew Valley build earned the People's Choice award at BrickCon, and it even attracted the game's creator. Eric Barone, the one man developer behind ConcernedApe, turned up to admire the recreation of his own work, something Jensen said was "even bigger news than an award."</p><p>Stardew Valley is a beloved farming simulator blended with role-playing game elements that was dubbed a masterpiece in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">IGN's updated 10/10 review for 2024</a>. "More than just a cozy farming sim, eight years of updates have grown Stardew Valley into a modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on," we said.</p><p>These updates have slowed down progress on ConcernedApe's next game Haunted Chocolatier though, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concernedape-hasnt-worked-on-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-because-of-troublesome-console-and-mobile-ports-of-stardew-valley-16">Barone said in August he hasn't worked on it "in a long time"</a> due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">the grandiose version 1.6 update</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Already Leaked Online]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-already-leaked-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise these days that a game has leaked just weeks before its release, and this time, it's happened to Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-sees-zelda-using-a-sword/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. This title is set for release on September 26, and allegedly copies of the game have already leaked online. Just on Friday, the game showed up for the first time on the internet, so now Nintendo has to try and get rid of any footage or gameplay, as it is illegal to have the game via emulation already. The ROM for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has been confirmed by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> in a YouTube video, but he has stated that he will not share it as it is "illegal and career-ending to do so."</p>
<p><iframe title="Zelda Echoes of Wisdom Has Fully Leaked Online!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaoF0C0YsC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't Nintendo's first rodeo, as 2023 was full of leaks for Nintendo. Content from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom surfaced online, as well as content from Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Additionally, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fully leaked online two weeks before its official release date. Metroid Dread, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl were also caught in the crossfire of being leaked on the internet before their release dates.</p>
<p>With Nintendo's strict rules about piracy, emulation, and game conservation, this is not surprising. ROMs of their most famous games from the 90s have been removed from the internet for years, including those who try to make fan games or mods. In addition, Nintendo has recently been giving out orders to retailers to cancel people's pre-orders of their first-party games. This was recently seen with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.</p>
<p>Nintendo never gave a reason for why they were doing that, but people assumed that it was so that the employees couldn't get hold of the game early, create a ROM, and pirate the game. It makes sense that Nintendo would make this decision when, just last year, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gamestop-employee-who-shared-tears-of-the-kingdom-leak-says-he-was-fired-at-nintendos-request/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop fired an employee</a> for doing that with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Compared to other current-gen consoles, the Nintendo Switch is incredibly easy to emulate and get running on a PC, just as previous Nintendo consoles have been. This is in contrast to consoles like the PlayStation 3, which is notoriously difficult to get running smoothly on a PC, no matter how powerful the rig is.</p>
<p>It now means that those who have legally bought The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will have to try to dodge all sorts of spoilers on the internet until September 26. That is much easier said than done, as spoilers have a way of popping up everywhere.</p>

That means you can expect a steady drip of trailers and news about some of the streaming service’s biggest properties. Last year, for instance, we got the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23952533/avatar-the-last-airbender-release-date-trailer-netflix"><em>Avatar: the Last Airbender</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955772/hades-netflix-reveal-geeked-week-2023"><em>Hades</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23955973/netflix-3-body-problem-teaser-trailer-release-date"><em>3 Body Problem</em></a>.</p><div><p>This year’s edition has some heavy hitters as well. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234788/its-almost-time-to-geek-out">A teaser video</a> suggests we’ll be learning more about the second seasons of <em>Arcane</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172175/arcane-league-of-legends-season-2-trailer-netflix">which is due out in November</a>), <em>Squid Game</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210859/netflix-squid-game-second-final-season-release-date">which starts streaming in December</a>), and <em>Avatar</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092243/netflix-avatar-the-last-airbender-season-2-renewal">which was renewed back in March</a>). We’ll likely also hear about the service’s steadily growing gaming offerings, highlighted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224649/monument-valley-3-is-coming-to-netflix">the upcoming launch of <em>Monument Valley 3</em></a>. The teaser also hints that we’ll finally be getting some <em>Stranger Things</em> news — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/2/23192070/stranger-things-4-volume-2-review">it’s been two whole years since the last season</a>.</p></div><p>The week will include daily announcements online, culminating with a live event on September 19th at 8PM ET.

The teaser’s shots of <em>Nocturne</em>’s heroes make it seem like season 2 will see them being haunted by memories of all they’ve lost. But the brief flashes of a cross engulfed in pink flames also feels like it could be a nod to the show bringing back certain characters like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson).</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246189/castlevania-nocturne-season-2-teaser-january-premiere">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-25185858-bbbd-48fe-bba2-b8af3e5f456e"><div><p>Netflix is getting a beautiful documentary next month.</p><p><em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24059264/sundance-film-festival-2024-best-movies-ai">one of my favorite movies at Sundance this year</a>.

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pacific-drive-review">review</a> praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.</p>
<p>Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.</p>

<p>Most of the changes are mentioned in the trailer above, and detailed in full in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">an update post on Steam</a>. But to give you a summary, there are now a bunch of fresh difficulty presets. "Scenic Drive" lowers crafting requirements and makes it impossible to die, for example. While "Joyride" keeps the mortal threat but minimises hazards and says that "gathering, crafting, and research requirements are all lowered." 

</p><p>If you are currently screaming "NO, THE BANJAXED CAR IS THE WHOLE POINT." Then, firstly, wow, relax. Secondly, this update also offers some very challenging presets as a contrast. "Olympic Gauntlet" ups the difficulty of everything - hazards, crafting, car damage, you name it. "Iron Wagon" makes everything similarly tough but also notes that "failing a run will delete your save file." </p><p> There is also the "Mechanic's Road Trip" option, which states: "Terrain and the status of the car impact driving more. Items to repair the car are more costly to craft, and can't be crafted on a run." Which sounds like somebody took an important-looking cylinder out of the roguelike's bonnet and installed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> straight into the engine block. </p>
<p>You can also go crazy on a bunch of difficulty sliders, say the devs, and create your own custom mode. Your flat tires can now be flatter, for example, and the radiation more radioactive. You could turn off the "instability storms" that threaten you during a run. Or you could make your engine go more vroom-vroom. There's also that fatal car boot I mentioned at the start of the article - an option titled: "Trunk Bonk kills". Don't laugh! Car boots are dangerous. My friend concussed a girl while on a date by absent-mindedly slamming the boot down while she was still looking for something. They got married and had babies. It is possible the concussion is to blame.</p>
<p>There are other changes in the update. You can now have your own music play through the car radio, and your garage's jukebox, by loading the files directly into a local folder in the game directory. That's cool. An undersung strength of the road-tripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> was its soundtrack, which had some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3MACUEAimI&amp;list=PLnF67y5vNQETIXmLg3Kes717M9vfDhqtV">pretty good tunes</a> (my favourite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61UPO8npOHc">Bloodoath by Exes &amp; Petey</a>).</p>
<p>I quite liked the pace of crafting when I toyed with Pacific Drive, but it's true it slowed me down enough to lose momentum and not finish the game. Difficulty is tough to measure, and often one of the best things you can do is just hand the nitty-gritty of that decision straight to the players. So fair play. </p>

One of the issues at play was apparently the profit margin that Intel wanted on each unit sold. Another thing that seemingly helped put AMD over the top was the fact that sticking with the chip maker would help limit potential issues around backwards compatibility for the next-gen console. </p><p>AMD designed the CPU and GPU for both the PS4 and PS5. In addition to the existing relationship, the continuation in manufacturing processes was likely part of why the transition between the two console generations was so smooth, with PS5 owners gaining access to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry">thousands of games from the older console</a></span> as soon as it launched. A similar transition for the PS6 would ensure three generations of of games, and players’ libraries, potentially all available on one device. </p><p>That’s in stark contrast to the PS3, whose unique Nvidia-based “cell” processor created all sorts of problems for developers porting games to the console and for Sony trying to get PS3 games playable on PS4. Without compatible hardware, software solutions are required, which can be costly and require huge investments from the console maker. Instead, Sony has so far opted to simply make PS3 games available on the PS5 solely through cloud gaming on the most expensive “Premium” tier of PS Plus. </p><p>The PS4 console cycle lasted seven years, and the PS5 one could go on even longer.

The PS5 Pro, coming in November for $700, could end up being the halfway point between the current generation and the release of a PS6.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[When is The PS6 Coming Out? PS6 Release Date Details]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out-ps6-release-date-details.982029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When is the PS6 coming out? <span>This question is</span> beginning to be asked following the announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>,&nbsp;and in this article, we’ll try to break it down.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t currently a direct answer as to when the PS6 release date will be confirmed, but court documents suggest that PlayStation has a year in mind. Dating back to court documents relating to the CMA’s investigation of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, count documents revealed that both Microsoft and Sony are not expecting to release their next-generation consoles until 2028.</p>



<p>“Indeed, the next new generation of consoles is not expected to be released before the fall of 2028 at the very earliest”, the documents read. While the court documents are from late 2022, and things can change, it does suggest that the PS6 will be released around 2028.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, we have various documents and first-hand accounts that imply that PlayStation has been back and forth on the date, but for the sake of argument, we’d like to think that PlayStation aims to release the PS6 in 2028.</p>



<p>Of course, things can change, but publicly and privately, that seems to be the direction the company is heading.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-will-have-amd-chip-with-backwards-compatibility-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report from&nbsp;Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>As for the next generation Xbox consoles, there are rumors within the community that suggest that Xbox might try to get ahead of the competition this generation and release their next generation console sooner. This could indicate that the next-generation Xbox could be released in 2026-2027, but we have no sources to corroborate the rumors.</p>



<p>When do you think the PS6 is coming out? Let us know in the comments below or in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>
