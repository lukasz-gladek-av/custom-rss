			<p>Before <strong>Hytale</strong> became the standalone MMO we know it to be today, it began its life as a <strong>Minecraft </strong>mod called <strong>Hypixel</strong>. Since breaking off to become Hytale, with the studio behind it taking the name Hypixel, the MMO has been on a massive journey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">one that <strong>saw the studio get acquired</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">subsequently shut down</a></strong>, only <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/">to be revived again</a></strong>, and as of last week, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">off to a stellar start in early access</a></strong>. Now, the game's latest storybook moment in a long line of storybook moments brings it back to its origins, as some truly impressive modding work adds <strong>crossplay support between Hytale and Minecraft</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Two separate (though admittedly very similar) games, not the same game on different platforms, but two separate, standalone games, can support crossplay with one another thanks to the work of modder <strong>iamcxv7</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-and-minecraft-get-crossplay-capability-thanks-to-intrepid-modder">IGN</a>, modder iamcxv7 explains their work as just "<em>Packet Trickery,</em>" but that seems to be a humble cover for what is an amazingly impressive feat. Even though the mod itself isn't publicly available yet, and iamcxv7 admits that there's still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they've proven it to be possible is an incredible full-circle, storybook moment for both Hytale and Minecraft.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>It's all just Packet Trickery</em>," explains iamcxv7. "<em>You could say I am running a Minecraft Server in the Hytale JVM which uses the Coordinate System of the Hytale World (As its the same) As well as takes a Snapshot of the Hytale World and reconstructs it and then send it to to the Client via Packets</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's a Hytale mod, so when it does go live, you won't need to add the mod to Minecraft to play with your friends on Hytale. You'll just add it to Hytale and play alongside your friends in Minecraft that way. It's all still early days for this mod as iamcxv7 admits that they only started working on it earlier this week, but even just as a proof of concept, this is an amazing effort.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/frosthavens-new-expansion-brings-playable-characters-missions-and-fan-suggested</link>
            <guid>1413376</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">As <em>Frosthaven</em>'s Digital Edition continues to move through the early access lifecycle, its latest update, Legacy of the Algox, brings with it three new heroes, an Algox storyline, a new pet, and all kinds of quality-of-life improvements. TechRaptor sat down with Snapshot Games' Game Director Hristo Petkov to discuss the update, see gameplay from the new expansion, and discuss how they've been reacting to fan-based feedback during the early access period.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Contents of the <em>Frosthaven </em>Update</h2><p dir="ltr">Jumping straight into the update, Petkov briefly highlighted each of the enhancements coming to the game. "What we're introducing in this patch is three new heroes; <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/frosthaven-all-advanced-classes-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fe9e70e-c0f4-441c-8fae-695d76f43e05" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the total in the board game is 17</a>, and with this update, we'll be at 14."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov also explained that with the three main branches of the <em>Frosthaven </em>story, "we're introducing the second. The third brand will be in the next update, which will be sometime in April, and the final chapter will be in the final release."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">What won't be releasing with the update, but shortly after, is an overhaul of the networking solution for <em>Frosthaven</em>. With a variety of tests, the team has created a more stable online experience using Epic Online Services.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Legacy of the Algox</em></h2><p dir="ltr">The Legacy of the Algox story will follow the culture of the Algox and the warring between the two different clans of yeti-like creatures, the Snowspeakers and Icespeakers. "Both of these clans have their problems with each other, and you need to help them resolve these issues.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's decision-making from the side of the player on how to approach these problems. We used this to create replayability, as there are generally three ways to solve the problem, each with its own missions"</p><p dir="ltr">One of these decisions comes after Scenario 4 of the new campaign content, when you need to make a decision on which tribe you're siding with; whichever one you side with, you'll unlock that class as a playable one. The spoiler-free names for these classes are Snowflake and Fist.</p><p dir="ltr">For anyone worried about missing out on a character, Petkov immediately followed up to explain, "At the end of this campaign, you unlock the other class."</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of campaign content, this update is also bringing with it "a lot of new stuff. New side scenarios, items, and so on."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's </em>Infuser Is Powerful But Has A Learning Curve</h2><p dir="ltr">Getting to see one of the new classes getting added to the game, we jumped into a scenario with the Infuser as one of our party members. "The Infuser has persistent effects that stay for the whole battle. When she plays an infusion, it has a persistent effect and a trigger effect.</p><p dir="ltr">"The trigger effect triggers when you play it for the first time, but triggers every time you play a new infusion. If you play one of these effects, for example, 'Attack for 3,' but you play a second infusion that heals it, it also triggers the attack of the previous one. If you play a third infusion, it will activate itself and the previous two."</p><p dir="ltr">The important part of playing this class is learning the different combo effects that you can begin to chain together, and how to best layer those effects over one another.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Player Feedback for Better or Worse</h2><p dir="ltr">Throughout our discussion, one of the topics that continued to be highlighted was just how much the team at Snapshot Games was paying attention to their fanbase. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7063e8-3c90-48be-a660-2a7afffa5e50" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">From playing it last year at SGF to today</a>, I could see how much added polish there was in the game. Petkov also highlighted a number of UI changes that had been made, and that there were still hundreds of icon improvements they had yet to implement.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-04.jpg?itok=3EYSs3m1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">A constant theme of our discussion was all of the little ways that the game had been shaped with the input of the community. I was interested to learn how the team balances those community requests alongside the standard development roadmap, and when the community might be asking too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov explained that they thought about these in a few categories. The first of which is when something is technically broken, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mechanic doesn't work as it does in the board game</a>. In this case, "the community is right, they are the board game fans. They do want things to happen similarly, so the tricky part is to implement what they want without making the game extremely tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Some examples of tedium that he brought up were players who want more control over the game, being allowed to move the enemies or calculate their AI, "but if we do that, the game will interrupt you all the time. Especially in multiplayer, this would be terrible."</p><p dir="ltr">An example of UI optimization that the team is working on for a future patch is how to reduce UI pop-ups when returning to the outpost and how to make sure what's contained on the screen is the distilled information necessary to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">"In some cases, our answer is obviously no."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I explained it multiple times to multiple players, but it's still getting asked."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">What's important from the team at Snapshot Games is that they're communicative about their decisions as the game is continuing to be developed to make sure, even if the community might disagree at times, that they understand why.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-07.jpg?itok=efhl-aX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-07.jpg?itok=UofmCYcf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I nodded in agreement with their desire for clear communication. "If the community is made aware, then they would understand and not make a big deal out of it."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a momentary pause before Petkov responded, "Ahhh, yeah, but that's not always happening."</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the bigger problems we're having, and I have no solution for it, is people playing the board game wrong. Playing digitally, they think the game is bugged when it's not. Recently, we had a negative review, a person said they would change their review to be positive if you fix&nbsp;this card," Petkov said.</p><p dir="ltr">"The card is actually absolutely correctly implemented. It's a problematic card, and people playing the board game don't understand how it works, but we implemented it correctly, according to Isaac Childres and everyone, but we got downvoted because people don't know the rules."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov took a moment to thank the active members of the community who are helping them convey corrections in these kinds of situations.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-05.jpg?itok=MgUgO_o_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">The Puzzle Book Will Keep You On Track</h2><p dir="ltr">In the board game, Petkov advised that "the Puzzle Book is very polarizing because it's interesting as a side thing, but in the board game, it's locking you out of game progression. What we did is we kept a lot of the story it has and the requirements, but we made it in the form of a main quest."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"The Puzzle Book is now leading your way, instead of locking your way."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the Puzzle Book, for each page you reach, you'll get a checklist of scenarios to complete to gather the relevant information to solve the puzzle. If you're ever not sure what to do next, you can use the Puzzle Book as a way to prompt yourself forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, a Solve button has also been added for each of the Puzzle Book's pages. The team understands that if you're invested in the gameplay, the puzzles available in the Puzzle Book might not be your thing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All Kinds Of Future Expansion Ideas Are Brewing</h2><p dir="ltr">Continuing the idea that people might play the game differently at home, the team at Snapshot Games is also looking at ways to implement different house rules, like being able to pool resources.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a variety of other game mode alterations that have been getting tested internally to appeal to a different kind of player. It's not entirely certain whether these will officially see the light of day, but I was fascinated to hear of the different testing going on.</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ece340c588e691efd54abcceb0920b6a3">For new players, a mode was tested where two cards are selected for you automatically. This limits player options, but also lets players focus on a smaller number of cards when they're starting, which should speed up their entry into the game.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ee2def30d192d0b679404d100e4ab5d7f">For players who enjoy the strategy game, but not so much the resource management and city building segments, a mode has been investigated where the city will automatically get built in an efficient manner, leaving the player to not have to worry.</li></ul><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-01.jpg?itok=XoxOkxqP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven </em>Progress From Table To Screen</h2><p dir="ltr">The most exciting idea that I heard about from Petkov was that they're investigating making a save game creator. This wouldn't just be a way to give yourself access to all of the resources you need or unlock characters early, but instead would be a way that you could 'convert' your physical game status to the digital game.</p><p dir="ltr">An example was given of a group of players who live further apart, so can only play in person once a month. If they could 'import' their physical save into the game, then they could play remotely at different times, and then when they get back together to play physically, they can 'export' their progress back to their dining room table.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the players are playing this board game for a couple of years, and they haven't finished it. They don't want to spoil themselves with the board game, but if they could do both, then that would be amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is something we'll definitely do for the final release."</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's Legacy Of The Algox</em> update will be launching on Steam and the Epic Game Store on January 22. With the next update expected in April, it won't be too much longer until the game is fully released.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/frosthavens-new-expansion-brings-playable-characters-missions-and-fan-suggested]]></content:encoded>

Out today in early access, Turnbound is a tile and turn-based autobattler about mythical heroes trapped in a haunted boardgame, where the starting player is chosen by flipping a coin bearing a picture of a cat’s anus. It’s saying a lot for Turnbound’s mellow, fairytale ambience and rich, rosy tile designs that I consider the cat’s anus a positive – a touch of whimsy, rather than just, well, that feeling you get when you’ve been flashbanged by a picture of a cat’s anus. Rare indeed are the videogames that contain a cat’s anus, and rarer still are the videogames in which the cat’s anus isn’t grounds for a refund.

<p>
Look, shut up about the cat’s anus already. You’re obsessed with the cat’s anus. There’s so much more to Turnbound than this. To start afresh: the story is that you’ve been trapped in a haunted boardgame. To get out, you must choose a hero – the current choices are Robin Hood, Sun Wukong the Monkey King, and Lewis Caroll’s Alice - and surround them with tiles that perform attacks, confer protection, or synergise with other tiles. Then you autobattle other players and heroes over 10 rounds. The twist is that some/all of these opposing boards are the work of other players, snuck into your game via Ye Olde Asynchronous Online (or a build code, if you prefer). 
</p>
<p>
Between rounds, there’s a shop screen where you can buy new tiles, level them up, and unlock squares on your board. At fixed points in each run, you’ll get opportunities to upgrade your hero and equip trinkets, which gives the proceedings some additional structure. The Steam page summarises it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-battles">Backpack Battles</a> meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> Battlegrounds meets the age-old practice of ‘inventory Tetris’. I think that’s a fair breakdown, after half an hour with the early access version.
</p><p>
During battles, tiles attack or activate according to placement and what they’re adjacent to. There are ‘taunt’ tiles to absorb the enemy’s best tricks, accessory tiles that confer status effects, reactive tiles that heal or generate coins when they’re meddled with, and much else besides. Heroes have different capacities. To give a hasty summary, Sun Wukong is good at chain attacks, Alice puts people to sleep while buffing herself through curious and curioser means, and Robin Hood is a counterpuncher.

It’s too early for me to seriously gauge the tactical depth, here, but it feels like this could have legs. In the short term, what elevates Turnbound is the presentation. True, the art is broadly the kind of medium-spice anime-fantasy malarkey you’ve encountered in any number of mobile fantasy games, but it doesn’t want for charisma. Run the cursor over tiles in the shop screen and they tinkle lovingly. Spare tiles pile up in a bag that is subject to real-time physics. And yes, there is the coin with the cat’s anus. Again, the cat’s anus is a plus. I was going to say I’m giving it a thumbs-up, but no, that would be bad.
</p>
<p>
The full game will offer “more characters, more skins, and hundreds more Items and Abilities”. Developers 1TK aren’t committing to a 1.0 launch date, but are giving a rough timeline of “4-6 months”. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3802470/Turnbound/">Read more on Steam</a>.

            <p>The second post-release update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is currently set to rock up this weekend, but the notes outlining what it'll include have rocked up a couple of days early. As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-first-major-update-adds-in-dinosaurs-stops-skeletons-drowning-and-lets-you-have-an-early-night">last week's first update</a> to the early access sandbox, this is another pretty beefy one, and especially noteworthy if raising the dead's your jam or you share Indiana Jones' main fear.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Posting out update two's notes, Hypixel boss Simon Collins-Laflamme made clear that a third update's also in the works and will be subject to "a longer pre-release period to give modders and servers time to catch up and update". Sticking with update two for now, its new additions include a necromancy system which'll let you summon up to five skeletal minions after picking up a grimoire from a skeleton praetorian. This is one of the things Hypixel's devs shared they were working on in mod form prior to release, so I imagine battles with your gang of undead will <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010372558198018181">look like this</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, builders'll be keen to know that the speed at which you mine now scales with your pickaxe's quality, karters'll be keen to know that the rail kart is faster, and fighters'll be keen to know that both polar bears and skeletons have been buffed. Oh, and folks who're afraid of snakes will likely be fans of the optional ophidiophobia accessibility mode the update's delivering.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hytale Update 2 – Patch Notes (Pre-Release)<br>Enable via Launcher → Settings → Pre-Release</p><p>Cosmetics &amp; Customization<br>• New mask face accessories (available for all editions)<br>• Armor slot visibility toggle (host-enforced for PvP/immersion)<br>• New mouth variants: Vampire, Cute,…</p></div>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2014200175401574576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It's also interesting to see Hypixel already working on the game's world generation tech. The swankier version two of Hytale's world generator - that being the one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-devs-hope-to-redefine-the-block-game-genre-with-their-world-generation-and-theyve-now-explained-how-it-works">the team are hoping to switch over to in the long-term</a> - is set to be "prepared for public documentation" to faciliate mod support. The update also includes a "major ore placement refactor in all zones" and some dungeon environment tweaks.</p><p>Right, I've been yacking for a bit now, and you're probably wondering about the headline. Update two will make some more additions to Hytale's character creator. There are new masks, cape animations I'm sure are sufficiently swooshy, and the berserker haircut has had its "tiling fixed". I didn't know a haircut could need bathroom maintenance, but there you go. Finally, there are three new mouth options - vampire, cute, and orc. There you go. Please tell me in the comments that reveal was worth the wait. Or tell me what you had for lunch. Anything really (within the usual guidelines). Go nuts.</p>
<p>Also here are some handy Hytale guides to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-play-multiplayer-dedicated-server-hosting">setting up a server</a>, getting it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">running on the Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-get-cobalt">hunting down key materials</a>.</p>

              <p><span>The difference between having to use one launcher or another to boot up a PC game might feel like a trivial thing to some, but a game launching only on something like the Epic Games Store as opposed to the more ubiquitous Steam can affect its reach. Tim Sweeney, Epic CEO and guy who posts too much for as much money as he has, seemed to forget this as he preached the virtues of capitalism and competition, saying that developers and gamers alike win when they have options.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Epic and Steam compete for each customer and each sale. On some transactions, Epic wins. On more, Steam wins. But one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals. <a href="https://t.co/RzU0twrmbr">https://t.co/RzU0twrmbr</a></p> <p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717881431769340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Michael Douse, Larian Studios’ publishing director, </span><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329?s=20"><span>responded</span></a><span> to Sweeney’s comments by stating that some of Epic’s publishing deals had seemed antithetical to Sweeney’s seeming belief in the value of “options” for developers and players. He specifically calledout the fact that </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2</span></i><span>, Remedy Entertainment’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2023-totk-baldurs-gate-3-alan-wake-2-1851109182"><span>award-winning horror sequel</span></a><span>, is only available on the Epic Games Store, rather than Steam. Remedy has said in recent financial reports that it has been </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-arent-satisfied-with-our-recent-financial-performance-remedy-says-it-will-return-to-profitability-by-delivering-hits-again/"><span>operating at a significant loss</span></a><span> in recent years, primarily due to its co-op shooter </span><i><span>FBC Firebreak</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/morning-checkpoint-fbc-remedy-ceo-mortal-kombat-star-wars-2000638199"><span>flopping last year</span></a><span>, but in general, the studio seems to be dealing with financial troubles. Douse argues that the company is losing out on “potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue” by sequestering </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2</span></i><span> on a less popular storefront.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Not that they need the money but a [percentage] take to Epic could’ve recouped dev costs [and] more,” Douse wrote. “Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don’t see the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> brand attempting to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Realistically I think if you want to be consistent in dev positive messaging you just take an easy PR W by amending the contract to allow them to drop the game on Steam now everyone has made their money and the drop-off in UA has made that angle negligible <a href="https://t.co/v5rAo6XUR3">https://t.co/v5rAo6XUR3</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2014033787378635220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, there is some evidence that suggests </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></i><span>might finally be making its way to Steam after almost three years. Just earlier this week, an </span><i><span>Alan Wake</span></i><span> “franchise” Steam bundle including the original game and the </span><i><span>American Nightmare </span></i><span>spin-off was </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/15407/"><span>renamed “Origins,”</span></a><span> implying that this collection of the early games may no longer encompass the entirety of the “franchise” as it exists on Steam. If so, maybe Remedy will get a nice bump in </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></i><span>sales, but it is important to point out that for all Sweeney’s touting competition and options as something we should all support, if the deals studios have to make to work with Epic leave studios at a disadvantage with potentially catastrophic consequences, it’s all just posturing.</span></p>

 <p><strong><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: 1/22/26, 12:03 p.m. ET: </b></strong>Remedy has weighed in on the situation <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630">with a statement of its own</a>, saying that while yes, there are some publishing deals that don’t work in a developer’s favor, the one it agreed to with Epic was “fair” to the studio.</p> <blockquote><p>Hi. There would be no <em>Alan Wake 2</em> without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/life-is-strange-reunion-fans/</link>
            <guid>1413355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9TLeraDVLs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcement</u></a> of <em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em>, fans of the series will see cultured bisexual wunderkind Max Caufield reconnect with sardonic sex-mess Chloe Price. It’s a reunion long coming, bringing two <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/EXPERIENCE-THE-EMOTIONAL-CONCLUSION-OF-THE-MAX-AND-CHLOE-SAGA-IN-LIFE-?ref=aftermath.site"><u>“iconic”</u></a> characters face to face again. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Marketed</u></a> as “by and for fans of the original,” and promising to “give Max and Chloe the ending they deserve,” <em>Reunion </em>is sure to please many players, but there’s an important question contained in all the promotion: What do fans <em>deserve</em> and what, if anything, do characters deserve as well?</p><p>I’m not judging anyone excited to see these characters share the screen again, and I’m not judging any developer on the game who is enthused to breathe fresh life into this couple. <em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em> could nail all of this and offer a rich, complex story of two messy people. But the current media moment is awash in attempts to please fans and create works “by and for” them, turning games back on themselves in twisted rearrangements of stories and experiences we already played back in the 2010s. </p><p><em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em> is simply the latest to join this trend. The original episodic series released in 2015, doggedly carving a niche for itself in spite of (or maybe because of) remarkably awkward dialogue and story-telling. A strange mix of wallflower hipster chic with the dark crimes of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, it made for a unique flavor of <em>Telltale</em>-esque adventure game. And at the core was a messy love story between two incredibly short-sighted teens.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9TLeraDVLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Life is Strange: Reunion – Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Max was a bookish and artsy bleeding heart and Chloe was a wild, dyed-hair rebel. Their friendship was an odd mix; Max’s mellow nature balanced Chloe’s recklessness even if Chloe’s tendency to fight the people around her strained her relationships. An odd twist to this was Max’s ability to rewind time and jump into alternate possibilities. Her constant use of this power led to a compelling final choice in the narrative: choose to travel back in time and allow Chloe to die or let Chloe live and watch her hometown of Arcadia Bay get consumed in a massive storm seemingly caused by her mucking in the timestream. What a big decision!</p><p>Fans loved it. They called it “Bae or Bay” and people still argue about what the “right” choice was. That’s a testament to how electric a couple these two are. Their tortured, time-traveling lesbian romp woke up countless players to all kinds of feelings. <em>Life is Strange</em> was a true lightning in the bottle fandom success.&nbsp;</p><p>The core question of what choice Max made was left mostly to linger all the way until 2024’s <em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. This game saw Max return, allowing fans to select what choice she made, but shockingly neither path led to a terribly happy life. This was particularly true if players chose that Chloe was alive. Yes, she and Max had a stretch of life together. Yes, they got to love and care for each other. But then they broke up because if you’re gonna be true to Chloe’s character, that inevitably means that she’d push away even the person she loved most in the world.</p><p>In many ways this is a bold choice not only for the decision to not allow for a “clean” path for fans to follow, but because it keeps true to the fiction even though that highlighted how flawed these two people were. It had the confidence to accept that even the most passionate of people are not guaranteed a perfect ending. People are complex, messy, and make mistakes even after the story is “over.” Life goes on, and there are no promises that can’t unravel.</p><p>A plot point of <em>Double Exposure</em> is Max’s ability to leap between two timelines. Near the climax of <em>Double Exposure</em> these timelines are merged, and this paves the path for <em>Reunion</em>, allowing all players to bring Max and Chloe together in a story that the marketing claims gives them “the ending they deserve.”</p><p>What do characters deserve? To say that they deserve anything creates a strange value judgment, which positions characters as <em>the</em> force of a story. On face value that makes sense–of course a story revolves around characters! But to say they “deserve” certain things starts to limit the stories you can tell. In real life, people deserve plenty of things. They deserve health and a roof over their head, they deserve dignity. In a story? That’s messier. We tell all kinds of stories, sometimes not always bearing the perfect ending, because they help us understand the world.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Life Is Strange: Reunion (Deck Nine)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To give Max and Chloe the ending they deserve means playing a multiversal long con across several games, all of which is targeted at upturning one of the most talked about endings of the last decade of games. To give them the story they deserve means potentially bending over backwards in many directions to please fans and risk the developers not telling the story they actually wanted to tell. To suggest these characters deserve more is to imply their story was not complete by itself. It implies prior work, perhaps even the work of people not at the studio anymore, was flawed and faulty. To say that this game is the one for fans paints the other games as somehow not being for fans because they didn’t give what folks “deserved.”</p><p>Characters don’t deserve anything, and I don’t think fans do either. The goal of a story cannot simply be to satiate the hunger of fanatics or to smooth out the ripples of a world. Even the most indulgent self-insert fan fiction arguably operates on higher goals than this; the writer crafts the silly tale in order to address something in their soul. You don’t write to <em>fix</em> a story; it ideally addresses something inside us. You don’t write because fictional characters need it. You write because you need it. You do it because there’s something in you that needs to be said.</p><p>Maybe that’s happening with <em>Reunion</em>. Maybe solving the story of Max and Chloe addresses some yearning on the part of the storytellers; I don’t know their hearts. What I do know is that many people create art to make life more bearable, safely explore dangerous situations, or maybe to give themselves the voice that the various injustices and pressures of the real world have robbed from them. Even the most crass and selfish writing, and even the most mature fiction, must do something <em>more </em>than exist for its own sake. The line is blurry in this case. What are we doing? Are we making something true or something marketable? Said another way: if you’re making something with the intention to market it far and wide, does that make it harder—impossible even—to still write something soul-soothing and true?</p><p>When I see marketing about <em>Reunion</em> talk about giving characters what they deserve and being for fans by fans, I cannot help but brace for something terrible. Even if, as the game’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Xbox Wire post</u></a> states, “their reunion could be no quick fix,” I cannot help focus on that final word: fix.We must fix this. We must fix our stories. We must save our characters. We must please our fans. We must protect our bottom line. We must take it all back. We must smooth all friction.</p><p>It’s easy to see how we reached this point. The world is a mess potentially on the brink of war and certainly in the throes of ecological collapse. The games industry itself is imploding with jobs lost by the thousands and studios fizzling away into the ether. Through all this, people want stability. They want known quantities. They crave a return to a time when things were not so scary. And executives at big companies with popular franchises want to find ways to sell their games and keep things out of the red. Do it right and you’ll even snag a good Metacritic score alongside all those big sales numbers.</p><p>You can see it in many “franchises” in the AAA space. Having blown up their playerbase with the disastrous <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, Electronic Arts fashioned <a href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions/"><em><u>Battlefield 6</u></em></a> into the familiar well-trod modern warfare of past successes. After spending two main entries and almost a decade with new settings and characters (ignoring various remakes), <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>returns players to Raccoon City and brings back grizzled veteran Leon Kennedy for some zombie smashing.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Resident Evil Requiem (Capcom)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In some cases, studios can resell old stories at a higher price. When <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> releases next month, the old remaster will be delisted and unavailable for individual purchase. Instead of paying twenty dollars on Steam, you pay sixty dollars to enjoy a story that was originally released in 2009. And some people will pay because it reminds them of old times. </p><p>It is hard to not imagine Chloe Price being glass that read “Break In Case Of Emergency.” At a time when the prevailing desire is to return to a more innocent time and during a period when fandom pressure seems to overwhelm developers as studios struggle to stay alive, I am not entirely sure the story promised in <em>Reunion</em>’s marketing is the one that wants to be told and not the one which is simply crowd-pleasing. While Xbox Wire writes that <em>Reunion </em>is “a full circle moment for both developers and fans,” there were possibly other voices in the room: voices from marketing or publishing departments, mandates from people with higher paychecks. It might be this is really where the makers of <em>Life is Strange </em>or <em>Resident Evil</em> or any other game that promises something “by and for” fans want to go next, but I’m also certain that people in the marketing and publishing departments of each respective studio are relieved that they don’t need to pitch players quite so hard to buy their games.&nbsp;</p><p>And maybe there were voices from the world outside too: a false promise of simplicity, that mess can be overwritten. Be it from real fans or imagined, there might have been a pressure to please above all other things. The marketing tells players that stories are here to cater to them, that they <em>deserve</em> those stories. And while this could be a story that really grapples with those old choices and mistakes, it could also be one that says that what fans and characters deserve are no loose ends and gives them a way to make everything “okay.”&nbsp;</p><p>To wind back the clock on Chloe Price betrays a certain kind of anxiety and suggests, at least through marketing language, that the games after <em>Life Is Strange</em> lack a kind of legitimacy. Those were not you, dear fans. We’d never betray you like that. We’ll always give you what you deserve. Let us return together to a simpler time before we made hard choices.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a lie and a dangerous one. It is a poison dropped into the well by the forces of capital. Art is a gift from one person to another; it is a message crafted to express the truths we cannot adequately state through simple conversation. Characters don’t deserve anything, and players don’t deserve anything but what is true. And stories born of financial anxiety, stories which upturn progress and shift back to the comfortable, are not telling us the truth.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company is back with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion of 2026, and it's a <em>fantastical</em> one.</p>
<p>The 'Fantastical Parade' set launches on <strong>28th January</strong> at <strong>5pm PST / 1am GMT (29th) / 2am CET (29th)</strong>, featuring none other than Gardevoir on the cover. This one throws in a couple of new Mega ex cards for Gardevoir, Mawile and Teal Mask Ogerpon, as well as a particularly fetching full art card of Falinks.</p>
<p>The above trailer provides a pretty decent overview of what we can expect from the expansion, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>Fantastical Parade will also see the introduction of Stadium cards into TCG Pocket, which, much like the regular card game, can apply effects over the entire battle.</p>
<p>With just one week until this one arrives, it might be a good time to start saving your Pack Hourglasses.</p>

            <guid>1413325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s not uncommon for workstations and gaming setups to get cluttered fast. Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and managing each of them can be a hassle. If you’re looking to reduce the cable mess on your desk and want something that can power/charge all your essentials at once, we recommend checking the 14-port Anker Prime docking station out, especially at its current price.</p>
<p>This 14-in-1 solution is great for charging, transferring data, and even managing dual displays. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">It normally retails for a not-so-friendly price of $270, but you can grab it today for just $170 at Amazon. That’s after a massive 37% limited time discount</a>. It’s a straightforward offer, meaning you don’t have to worry about using any coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Delivery is free too, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Manage All Your Essentials In a Single Place</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 ports in total, which lets you manage a ton of gadgets simultaneously. At the front, you’ll find USB-C and USB-A for fast data transfers and charging, plus an audio jack for headphones or earbuds. The back features HDMI ports for a multi-monitor setup, as well as an Ethernet port, additional USB-A ports, and a USB-C upstream connection for your laptop.</p>
<p>A 160W of total output is capable of fast charging up to four devices at the same time using three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max. Moving files across will take seconds, too, thanks to speedy transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. Translation? With this at hand, you can connect all your important peripherals in one place. Think topping up your phone up as you finish a work deadline, plus offloading heavy files from your PC to a secondary storage device in just a couple of minutes.</p>



<p>Those who prefer a larger, more productive setup will appreciate how the dual HDMI ports offer crystal-clear streaming or mirroring across two displays at up to 2K@60Hz with a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 laptop. With Windows, you can use the setup to keep meetings on the secondary display while working on the main one, or even use a third display for reference material. It works a bit differently on macOS, however, as both external displays will mirror the same content.</p>
<p>Compatibility-wise, the dock supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections, plus plays nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. What’s even better is that it comes with an efficient airflow system, and the ActiveShield technology monitors the temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to maintain optimal performance, even when things get a bit intense. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating and negatively impacting the connected devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box is the 14-in-1 Anker dock itself, a USB-C cable for the upstream port (3.3 ft, 100W, 10Gbps), and a safety sheet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">The dock is now available for just $170 at Amazon, down from $270. It’s not every day you get to save a nice $100 on an efficient solution such as this one</a>. Additionally, the offer is likely going to expire soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Akira Yamaoka on Remaking Silent Hill 2's Soundtrack (Again) for Return to Silent Hill]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/akira-yamaoka-on-remaking-silent-hill-2s-soundtrack-again-for-return-to-silent-hill</link>
            <guid>1413313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill franchise has stood the test of time for many reasons, not least of which being the haunting, ethereal soundscapes of these survival horror games. And when it came to adapting Silent Hill to film, perhaps the smartest thing director Cristophe Gans did was make sure that series composer Akira Yamaoka was still involved.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now Silent Hill is back in theaters with the third film in the series, Return to Silent Hill, and Yamaoka is along for the ride again. IGN was recently able to speak with Yamaoka about his work, how composing a Silent Hill movie is very different from the games, and which game he’d like to see adapted next. Read on to see what he had to say. [<em>Note - this interview was performed with the aid of a translator.</em>]</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is effectively an adaptation of the Silent Hill 2 game. What makes Yamaoka’s involvement interesting is that this is effectively the third time he’s worked on this particular soundtrack. He scored the original Silent Hill 2 back in 2002, and he rebuilt his work from the ground up for the 2024 remake. Now he’s tackling that soundtrack from a whole new angle for the film version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka explains to IGN that there’s a fundamental difference between scoring for games and scoring for film. One is an interactive medium where the other is linear, and that makes a profound difference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the major differences between video games and film is, as you know, film is a linear format as opposed to video games, [which are] an interactive format where people have choices,” Yamaoka tells IGN. “People with a controller can decide how they experience the story. We have to create the music and all the elements to be interactive so that it can follow how the player plays the games.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka continues, “But the film is, of course, different; it's a linear format. So what that means is everybody would watch the music at certain scenes, and so it's very much predictable, or it's more pre-decided, because that's what the film experience is. That gives me the opportunity to create a much deeper emotional experience, something that we can have even deeper and sharper creative intent for each moment. That to me is a very different opportunity that I was given compared to video games.”  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Yamaoka if there were any particular themes or motifs from Silent Hill 2 he was eager to explore and rearrange for Return to Silent Hill, to which he pointed to a pair of classic songs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are many songs that came from the games, such as ‘Theme of Laura’ and ‘Promise.’ And again, as we discussed earlier, linear format film is different from video games, so that allows us to have music for certain emotional effects that the director would like to share with the audience. To create the experience, we were able to change the tempo and spot, really just specifically have the music in a certain way at the tempo and the tone and tension and temperature so that it would support the specific scene. That is a really just wonderful opportunity that we have for the film. It's much more than the length of the scenes, or maybe just the format of the scenes, but it's just the opportunity that we have to be much more, have a micro-control, specific control to have an emotional delivery. So naturally, I enjoy the process of rearranging the themes, and again, including ‘Theme of Laura’ and ‘Promise’ and other music that came from the games to be very film-specific so that we could deliver the emotional message and vision that Christophe Gans had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka makes it clear that Gans had a very specific vision for how he wanted his sequel to sound. That included selecting certain themes and songs from other games in the Silent Hill series. It was all about furthering the director’s vision for the film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a creative vision that the director had, because, of course, he focuses on the emotion and he focuses on how to deliver it” Yamaoka says. “There are certain songs from other Silent Hills that had a very good fit for what he was trying to achieve. And of course, it was not one-directional. It was a communication process where the director and myself had to come to the conclusion that there are maybe certain scenes where we could use different music.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the elements that separates Return to Silent Hill from the source material is that the film includes a series of flashbacks exploring the romance between James Sunderland (Jeremy Irvine) and Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson). We were curious how Yamaoka wanted to take advantage of that new material and explore a relatively happier period for these characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's one of the very unique elements of the film, and we had a great creative opportunity to discuss this with the director,” Yamaoka says. “When I saw it, I first tried to approach it in a melancholic way, reading towards romantic music and realized that this is an impossible approach. I had a chance to share this with Christophe Gans and run it by him. He gave me really wonderful feedback, and he suggested that maybe we can shift the direction to a different way, so then I tried that direction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yamaoka continues, “So it was very much a communicative, very creative process and a communication process that we had that, after the impression that I received, I ran the idea by him sometimes by presenting the music to the scenes already. We just had many of our creative thoughts, so we exchanged our ideas a lot. So it was very much a collaborative process, and I really enjoyed it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s the question of what the future might hold for the Silent Hill movie series. To date, the films have mostly adapted material from the original three games. Assuming a fourth is greenlit at some point, what game would Yamaoka like to see adapted next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, I'd really love to see other Silent Hills become filmed, but if I were to pick one, maybe I would say Silent Hill 4: The Room, because it's the unique Silent Hill in that it was a first-person game experience. And also, the setting is very different from the previous Silent Hills from Silent Hill 1 to 3, which has been transported to a different town, but Silent Hill 4 is different. So naturally, the nature of Silent Hill is different, but still the creative essence - the experience itself - stays the same. So I think it has a wonderful opportunity to become a film and provide the core elements and experience within Silent Hill. And I certainly hope that it'll be directed by Christophe Gans. He's just really wonderful, and I really hope that we have a chance to collaborate on that too, if we have the opportunity.”</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill hits theaters on January 23.

            <p>
Veteran Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe, perhaps best known for his work overseeing the long-running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> series, is reportedly retiring after almost four decades with the company.
</p>
<p>
Tanabe joined Nintendo in 1987, serving as director and course designer on Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic - the game retooled into Super Mario Bros. 2 for release in the west. Since then, Tanabe has been involved in almost every major Nintendo franchise, from The Legend of Zelda to Donkey Kong.

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4 review in video form.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTb-cC6Sw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
2002 saw Tanabe helping steer the Metroid series toward its three-dimensional debut as co-producer on Metroid Prime, and he's continued to serve as producer on the series in the years since, overseeing the likes of Metroid Prime 2, Metroid Prime 3, and Metroid Prime: Federation Force. That's alongside producer work on many other series, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, Kirby, and WarioWare.
</p><p>
But it appears Tanabe's time with Nintendo is now at an end following the release of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">reported by VGC</a>, Tanabe announced his retirement in an interview with Japanese magazine Nintendo Dream, uploaded to Chinese social media platform Weibo. "I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward," he explained (via machine translation), adding "It's been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo."
</p>
<p>
Tanabe also revealed a sequel to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "still uncertain" but expressed his hope that developer Retro Studios and Risa Tabata - who served as assistant producer on last year's game, and who'll reportedly succeed Tanabe - "will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close." We've asked Nintendo for comment.
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 did, of course, have a long and troubled history, initially being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch">announced in 2017</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-development-rebooted-from-scratch">all work at Bandai Namco Studios was scrapped</a> and shifted to previous Metroid Prime developer Retro Studios. When it finally launched for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> last December, it was to a mixed reception. "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through," Eurogamer's Alex Donladson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">wrote in his three star review</a>, "but this game could and should have been so much more."

            <p>Valve has announced that Steam will feature 22 themed fests in 2026, coming in at around a different video game festival promotion every 2.4 weeks.</p>
<p>This announcement came via a <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/2014075322300510352">personable video posted on Steam''s official Twitter account</a>, in which examples including detective-fest, board game fest, tower defence fest, and deck-builder fest were mentioned among many others.</p>
<p>These 22 will come alongside the three Next fests in February, June, and October. There will also of course be the four seasonal sales events in 2026 as there were years prior. In total, you're looking at 29 total Steam promotions in the 344 days.</p>

<p>Steam fests have proven themselves to be powerful marketing tools in the right hands, with various AAA and indie developers using it to their advantage in promoting games along specific genres of thematic lines. The Next Fests, which put a spotlight on upcoming releases, has proven <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/channelling-the-spirit-of-inscryption-my-favourite-steam-next-fest-game-is-a-game-within-a-game-and-its-brilliant">a fantastic way of discovering cool games you may otherwise have missed</a>.</p><p>Steam itself is continuing its reign as the most popular PC games platform however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">recently passing the 42m concurrent user milestone earlier this month</a>.

<p>35% more than the PS4</p>

<figure data-uuid="a3865a73ba47d"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3865a73ba47d/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 ended 2025 with a total of <strong>4.4 million units</strong> sold in the US, according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczduu7kxc2b">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>
<p>This means that after its seventh month on the market, Nintendo's new system is still the fastest-selling home console in US history. Piscatella noted afterwards that the Game Boy Advance is the overall winner in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this means that the Switch 2's install base is nearly double that of its predecessor after the same amount of time. It's also roughly 35% ahead of the PS4 over the same amount of time, which was remarkably popular when it launched back in 2013.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's sales had slowed down somewhat over the Christmas period, falling by around 35% compared to the original Switch during the same period. It seems, however, to have had little effect on the console's overall performance.</p>
<p>Concerns around potential price rises persist as the US grapples with tariffs and the rapid rise of AI, but overall, it seems Nintendo's new console is off to the best start we could have possibly hoped for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced that it would be undergoing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong> which saw the company <strong>cancel six games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake,</strong></a> delay another <strong>seven unannounced titles</strong>, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">entirely restructuring the company's whole operating model</a>.</p>



<p>To call it a 'major reset' was practically an understatement, as it wasn't just a portfolio reset, but one that will forever change how the French company operates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its share price didn't take the news well, and, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a>, the company's <strong>share price dropped by 34%.</strong></p>



<p>What's worse, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points out, is that after yesterday's major drop, the company's market cap sits around <strong>€500 million</strong>. Back in 2018, its market cap was closer to <strong>€10 billion</strong>, which means that in just the <strong>last eight years, Ubisoft has lost somewhere in the range of 95% of its value.</strong></p>







<p>At the time of this writing, the company's stock price currently sits at <strong>€4.37</strong>, marking the lowest point for its share price in over a decade, as it hasn't dropped below <strong>€5.00</strong> since 2011. When you look at these historic lows, it's understandable as to why the company's shareholders were calling for the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf"><strong>Guillemot</strong> <strong>family</strong> to be removed from leadership</a> back in 2024, and why shareholders have reportedly been looking at all options, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">including a buyout</a>, in recent years.</p>



<p>If not for <strong>Tencent</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-raise-its-stake-in-ubisoft-aims-to-become-largest-shareholder/">which has continuously raised its importance</a> within Ubisoft over the last few years, solidifying itself as a core partner for the company with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong> last year</a>, chief executive officer and co-founder <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, and the rest of his founding family might've already found themselves ousted from the company they started all the way back in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while chief financial officer <strong>Frederick Duguet</strong> did not comment on share price expectations, he emphasized that it's what the company does next that's most important, namely how it can execute its plans now that it is undertaking this "<em>major reset</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>What I can repeat is that we want to focus on execution," </em>said Duguet.<em> "It's a major reset and we want to make sure that everything we've decided will allow the Creative Houses to succeed in their specific role. And we want them to be the best in the world in each and every segment we're in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We will be also entering into a few additional segments. We mentioned that we still have four new IPs in development. But again, the market is super selective. We are on a good path to return to very high quality games, as we've seen lately, but we need to go further and we are convinced that when we do it well, then the return on investment can be exceptional. But you need to be in the top two of each and every segment.</em>"</p>

The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D will debut on January 29th, priced at $499.</p><p>That’s $20 more than the initial retail pricing of the 9800X3D, and this faster 9850X3D will feature the same 8-core / 16-thread CPU running at faster boost clocks. The boost clock on the 9850X3D is 400MHz higher than the standard 9800X3D, and it maintains the same 120-watt TDP. It’s essentially a better-binned version of the 9800X3D.</p><p>It’s still not clear exactly how much these higher boost clocks will help with PC games, and AMD has admitted that most of the benefits will be found in frequency-sensitive titles like esports games. Still, at least you won’t have to pay much more for a faster chip — that’s if you can find the 9850X3D at its retail price later this month.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/865648/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-price-release-date-announcement]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingsman-zazzastack-marvel-rivals-black-widow-deadpool-cup-2000662244</link>
            <guid>1413262</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While in a practice match to prepare for a $40,000 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-rivals"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> tournament, content creator Kingsman265 rather insistently suggested a change in his team’s composition. The discussion sparked a series of arguments with his teammates, which escalated to the point of tournament host BasimZB giving Kingsman265 the boot from the tournament altogether.</span></p> <p><span>The tournament, held on January 18, was called Deadpool Creator Cup, and it was meant to commemorate the titular character’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>recent addition</span></a><span> to the game. The tourney grouped 48 influencers together, and while this wasn’t a professional cup, the pool was significant. First prize would net around $3,000 to each player on the winning team, divided from a total of $18,000.</span></p>

 <p><span>Kingsman has uploaded </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyKlnqgNtXs"><span>a video to his YouTube channel</span></a><span> which shows the whole situation unfold. “You may not want the money, but I do, okay? I really want to win,” Kingsman265 told his teammates at one point. “I need money for college, I need money for everything, and I want to try my hardest to get the right composition.”</span></p> <p><span>His main suggestions involved asking fellow teammate and content creator zazzastack, a known Black Widow player, to switch out the sniper for another character, as well as attempting a “triple support” composition, which basically involves having three players, basically half of the team, using healers.</span></p>

 <p><span>As the teammates argued against Kingsman265 suggestions, the streamer stopped practicing with them and went out to q</span><span>ueue for ranked matches on his own. Shortly afterward, Kingsman265 reports that the tournament host messaged him to let him know he was out.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is my decision, based on what I saw, off the clips and the VODs, and what I’ve seen from different perspectives,” BasimZB </span><a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousFancyHareWTRuck-YvqOVi7EZ3UUKIQD"><span>said via Twitch</span></a><span>. “When you’re drafted to the team, to the moment you finish the tournament, you are part of this tournament, and you gotta play by the rules (…) there’s a level of respect that you need to have amongst your teammates, and amongst staff.”</span></p> <h2>Online harassment prompts a public apology</h2> <p><span>BasimZB went on to say that he saw and understood everything, but ultimately argued that if a player is interested in “pure competitiveness,” that person should “be a professional player” and take part in professional tournaments instead, as opposed to a creator-focused cup. The team Kingsman had been part of went on to come in seventh out of eight teams.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The video uploaded by Kingsman265 has accrued over 1 million views as of the time of publication. As </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-twitch-streamer-widow-main-tournament/"><span>noted by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, zazzastack, during the tournament stream, said that people who are coming to conclusions based solely on said video are not “fully informed” about the situation. The streamer later suggested that Kingsman265 left out parts of matches in which he “shit-talked” his teammates as well.</span></p> <p><span>Content creator Cece took it over to </span><a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></a><span> to share a lengthy apology about her behavior during the tournament as leader of the team Kingsman265 was on. In it, she says she regrets raising her voice and shutting down a teammate, as well as calling Kingsman265 a “loser,” while also saying that the heightened emotions of the situation led to these moments. Meanwhile, Zazzastack has stated that she’s been on the receiving end of harassment, with Kingsman265 fans subbing to her Twitch channel just to leave “disgusting” comments.</span></p> <p><span>Kingsman seems to be coming away from the situation pretty well, by contrast. </span><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kingsman265-is-now-making-bank-on-twitch-after-removal-from-40k-marvel-rivals-event-3308064/"><span>As noted by </span><i><span>Dexerto</span></i></a><span>, he’s amassed over 10,000 new subscribers on Twitch, and pulled in donations surpassing the amount he would have earned had he and his team won the tournament. </span><span>“I’ve already made more than the $3000 that I would have won for first place in the tournament, so stop giving me money,” he said on a recent stream.</span></p>

            <p>Tonight is the night when - after what has felt like months and months of waiting - we will finally get another look at Playground Games' Fable, thanks to the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>It isn't just the fabled Fable we will be seeing later, though, no sir! Xbox has also promised a look at the next game from Game Freak (yes, as in the Pokémon co-developer). This one is called Beast of Reincarnation, and takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, and will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>We will also get more news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>. Its release date has actually leaked ahead of this evening's presentation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leak-corroborated">the game looking set to arrive on 19th May</a>. We can presumably expect official confirmation later.</p>
<p>We will be watching tonight's Xbox Developer Direct, and you can join us for all the fun and chat from around 5.30pm, when I will be back at my computer, probably with a cheeky G&amp;T and some posh crisps in hand.</p>
