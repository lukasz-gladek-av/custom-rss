<section><p>The new mini battle royale is Fortnite's best mode for players who prefer not to get too sweaty.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It's starting to feel a little bit like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is overrun with different battle royale modes. We already had the standard BR that everyone knows, along with OG and Reload, each with no-build variants. Then, just a few weeks ago, Epic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">tossed in the new mobile-oriented Blitz Royale</a>, a mini battle royale with 32 players, for good measure. Can all these different modes continue to live alongside each other?</p><p dir="ltr">I think they can, so long as they each have a niche they can carve out among the greater Fortnite audience. Regular Battle Royale is the catch-all for general audiences, OG is for the folks who prefer a stable experience that rarely changes in major ways--or just those who have nostalgia for the Fortnite of yesteryear--Reload is for the sweats, and Blitz Royale, though it might seem extremely swift and sweaty at first glance, is actually the more casual alternative to all of those existing modes.</p><p dir="ltr">If you only played Blitz Royale right when it launched, you may not see it. When the mode initially dropped, it was pretty intense and full of sweaty folks, which was to be expected for an entirely new mode that everybody was trying out for the first time. But it didn't take long for things to mellow out as the player count normalized.</p><p dir="ltr">Since Blitz Royale was created to capitalize on Fortnite's return to iPhones in the US, the matches are very short, taking five minutes or less for the winning player or team, and matchmaking has to happen quickly. And with Fortnite, quick matchmaking usually means more bots in place of human players. It's certainly proven to be true with Blitz, which has typically populated my games with what seems to be eight human players alongside a pile of bot players--and that ratio tends to hold up whether I play solo, duos, or four-player squads. I've even had a bunch of squad rounds in which my team never seemed to encounter <em>any </em>human players at all--this has happened about every four or five rounds of Blitz Royale squads that I've played.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not trying to drag the mode over this, though. Most casual players don't care if they're fighting bots or human players, and they definitely aren't playing Fortnite to test their gaming skills against the best opponents available. For most players, the game's mix of skill-based matchmaking and a generous population of bots is the formula for a fun, casual game that's more about TikTok dances than cranking 90s. Likewise, somebody playing Blitz Royale on their phone while they ride the bus to work is probably just looking for a way to pass the time. For these folks, the inclusion of a bunch of bots is not a drawback at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Realistically, too, everything about Blitz Royale that makes it palatable for mobile play--the short matches, the lack of builds, the gimmicky stuff like weekly themed loot pools and medallions--also make it more fun for a casual audience that just wants to pop online and shoot something. You barely have to even do any looting, since Blitz starts you at half shields and will just give you an exotic or mythic weapon a minute or two into the round. With its fast-encroaching storm, small map, and bevy of overpowered weapons that simply appear in your inventory, Blitz Royale is really just Fortnite at its least complicated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4526323-fortnite-blitz-knight-outfit-1920x1080-ceeb16064313.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526323" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4526323-fortnite-blitz-knight-outfit-1920x1080-ceeb16064313.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526323"></a><figcaption>The Blitz Knight outfit can be earned in Blitz Royale.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4526323-fortnite-blitz-knight-outfit-1920x1080-ceeb16064313.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And having Blitz as essentially <em>the</em> casual mode makes it easier for the other battle royale modes to cater to a different audience, since they wouldn't need to be as accommodating to every type of player. Reload, in which players will automatically respawn as long as at least one member of their team remains alive, has been a great example of counterprogramming since it launched its new Squid Game-themed map last week. While I've had pretty long matchmaking times for Zero Build Reload matches, often taking more than two minutes to get me a round, the games themselves have been amazing. Just about every round of Reload I've played recently has been a barn burner.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing is, for a game of Fortnite's scale, matchmaking speed is everything. The longer it takes to get a match, says the conventional wisdom, the more likely that a player trained on modern trends of instant gratification will change their mind and not play at all. But with Fortnite now being more of a platform than an individual game, they can mix it up by providing their own alternatives. Don't wanna wait two minutes for a Reload match? Then play Blitz Royale or regular Battle Royale instead. Since Reload's matchmaking times are longer, it's not impossible to imagine that you could pull a win in Blitz Royale before you'd have landed from the bus in Reload.</p><p dir="ltr">With each of these battle royale modes attracting folks from across a spectrum of niches, they can target specific audiences more effectively. If most of the folks who care about matchmaking speed are playing Blitz, for example, then there won't be much need to speed up Reload's matchmaking by adding more bots. It's not splitting the audience so much as it is catering more specifically to the sort of experiences each player is looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands right now, Blitz Royale is slated to only stick around until mid-August. Presuming the player count stays healthy, though, it'll likely return sooner than later, giving more casual players a deceptively laidback mode built for them first and foremost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Anthem is going offline forever next year, EA and BioWare have announced, as the failed third-person shooter will have its servers shut down on <strong>January 12, 2026</strong>, nearly seven years since it launched in 2019.</p>



<p>You'd be forgiven if you thought Anthem's servers had already been shut down. The response online shows several people expressing surprise that the game is still playable. Even Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo thought the game was six-feet-under by now. </p>



<p>That's not the case though, and in fact, we now know that the chances to play Anthem, should you wish to revisit <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's failed attempt at forcing BioWare</a> to make a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-was-a-key-lesson-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-says-bioware/">the studio even admitted was not its forte</a>, are numbered. </p>



<p>At one point, it looked like Anthem's failure to launch could be salvaged. Its<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/anthem-flying-high-it-doesnt-last/"> release was a mixed bag</a>, to say the least, with some aspects of the game being truly memorable, with most who were around to try it remembering how good the flying mechanics felt. The rest of the game, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-anthem-below-expectations-will-support/">did not reach those same heights</a>, and the extent to which BioWare was out of its element was almost palpable. Still, work was put in to try and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-2-0-shooting-looting-redesign-more-satisfying/">find a path forward for Anthem</a>, as EA couldn't seem to let it go as easily as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard,</a> for example.</p>



<p>Development on Anthem 2.0 <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/">officially stopped in 2021</a>, and since then, the game has sat on EA's servers, collecting dust, it would seem, until someone found it and was no doubt surprised to find it was still active. </p>



<p>"<em>We have an important update to share regarding Anthem</em>," EA began in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">blog post on the game's official website</a>. "<em>After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026. This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline. We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we'd like to thank you for that.</em>"</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Anthem is playable for another 193 days, to be exact. </p>

<p>Anthem will also be removed from the EA Play playlist on August 15, 2025, and EA says that the sunsetting of the game has not led to any layoffs at developer BioWare. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/">Anthem joins a growing number of live-service games that have had the plug pulled on them</a>.

			<p>It isn't just Microsoft that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceling games left and right</a>—according to a <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">report</a> originating from Polish website Pulz Binesu and later <a href="https://www.gamekult.com/actualite/en-souffrance-techland-annule-deux-jeux-dont-son-action-rpg-de-fantasy-en-monde-ouvert-3050864575.html">reported</a> by Game Kult, Dying Light developer Techland has also recently canceled two of its projects.</p>



<p>Here's what they said in a statement provided to Wccftech:</p>



<p><em>Game development is never a straight line, and sometimes fresh approaches are necessary to make great games. What's important here is that none of the reported changes have resulted in staff reductions. Developers were moved to other projects and are working on a number of games in our pipeline. Our primary focus right now is to release Dying Light: The Beast for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. After the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, we will share more about future titles in due time.</em></p>



<p>Supposedly, one of the canceled games is their upcoming fantasy action RPG based on a new intellectual property. This project has been in the works for at least nine years, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-dev-working-fantasy-title-openworld-rpg-elements-huge-aaa-game/">certified</a> by our coverage from May 2016. The game evidently was put to the back burner as Techland focused on Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but the Polish studio quickly started discussing it after that game launched. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-rpg-first-image-cdpr-veterans/">got</a> the first look at an artwork in May 2022; this title was in development at the Warsaw office, which had been bolstered by former CD Projekt RED developers, and was highly ambitious, according to Techland:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Our ambition is to introduce a brand new IP that is vastly different from what we have been doing for the past several years. We want to create a fully next-gen experience. A new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world, fueled by the skills and experience we have gained as a team over the years, infused with new ideas, passion, and creativity. </em></p>



<p>Another artwork was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-game-new-concept-art-climbing-huge-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> in May 2023. That was the last we heard about the project. Nothing much is known about the other game. However, the report says that another project has taken their place. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-developer-techland-has-canceled-2-upcoming-games/">Insider </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-developer-techland-has-canceled-2-upcoming-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming</a>, it should be a new Call of Juarez title. As a reminder, the studio regained the rights to the IP from Ubisoft in 2018.</p>



<p>Techland is, of course, also polishing up Dying Light: The Beast, which will be released on August 22 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will get it later in 2025. Check out our hands-on preview and developer Q&amp;A <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this URL</a>.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Online Entertainment chief John Smedley and his new team at Distinct Possibility Studio have unveiled their first game, Reaper Actual. And while some aspects of this first-person shooter may seem very familiar to CoD fans, it's set in a very large-scale persistent online open-world with a map that's bigger than anything in Call of Duty Warfare. Up to 200 players can join a single server in some of the epic battles teased in the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_Jb0jjlS4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XC_Jb0jjlS4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At least for now, Reaper Actual is strictly for PC, and it's essentially the fusion of an MMO and a FPS. The game is set on an island called Marova, which is overrun by rival factions vying for control. As a Reaper, players can sell their services to the various factions on the island, and use all manner of vehicles and weapons to achieve their goals.</p><p>Because the factions are already at odds with each other, the enemy AI characters will wage war with or without players' involvement. Players can choose to take sides or take advantage of the chaos for their own purposes. Players can also create their own bases to defend, and raid the bases that belong to other players or AI. In turn, AI characters and rival players can invade your base as well.</p><p>Control of the island will fluctuate depending upon which factions claim victory in battle. Players can choose to engage each other in PvP fights or to team up and take sides. The game will also feature a crafting system and a player-driven economy for the gear and items that they create.</p><p>Reaper Actual doesn't currently have a release date, but players can <a href="https://reaperactual.firstlook.gg/signup/foundationplayer/eligibility" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for testing at the game's official site</a>.</p>

<p>He said "I've been to the year 3000"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Sega has shared the opening theme to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> and, rather than pulling in familiar faces such as Crush40, Kellin Quinn, or Madeline Wood, there's a very familiar voice to a certain generation of people from the UK.</p>
<p>James Bourne of the British pop-punk band <strong>Busted</strong> — yes, really — is the lead vocalist on <strong>Cross the Worlds</strong>, the upcoming racer's opening song. We haven't heard the name Buster for a <em>long</em> time. Pinch us.</p>
<p>Composed by Takahiro Kai — one of the composers on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> — the theme itself is very upbeat and pop-rock flavoured, not a million miles away from what we've come to expect from Sonic. A little cheesy? Maybe. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing - Cross the Worlds - (Opening ver.)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d24338987dbb7/sonic-racing-cross-the-worlds-opening-ver.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Just in case you need to triple-check — <em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR9FGj1Bj70&amp;ab_channel=SonictheHedgehog">Sega</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're not sure just how well-known Busted are outside of the UK; the band was formed in 2000 and released two hit albums during their five-year tenure. "What I Go to School For" and "Year 3000" are probably their most well-known hits — the latter of these was covered by the <strong>Jonas Brothers</strong>, and Busted then re-recorded the song with the boy band in 2023.</p>
<p>The band broke up in 2005 so the members could pursue solo projects. Bourne is also the lead singer of the band <strong>Son of Dork</strong> and also had a brief solo career under the name <strong>Future Boy</strong>, before supporting fellow British band <strong>McFly</strong> and forming <strong>McBusted</strong>. Busted reunited in 2015 and are still going.</p>
<p>So... there you have it! Not the collaboration we were expecting, and a bit of a blast from the past for many Brits, we're sure. Whether Bourne appears on other tracks in-game, we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds launches on Switch on 25th September, with a Switch 2 version following later. While the game will feature plenty of Sonic characters, we're also getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch-2-version-announced-alongside-paid-upgrade-for-switch">Hatsune Miku, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, Joker from Persona 5, Steve from Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sonic-racing-crossworlds-officially-reveals-nickelodeon-collaboration">Nickelodeon characters</a> as DLC racers.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Cross the Worlds in the comments</em>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/">New Arc Line</a>, a new cRPG from Fulqrum Publishing and developer Dreamate that launched in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/">early access last November</a>, is getting its first major update later this month on July 17, 2025, with its Smoke &amp; Mirrors update. </p>



<p>Smoke &amp; Mirros will add a new playable race to the game as Dwarves get introduced, along with two new playable classes that'll be exclusively available to Dwarves before being made available to players playing as Humans or Elves. The update will also add a new questline for players to dig into called 'Step Behind the Curtain,' that'll also introduce a new location for players to explore called the Sacred Tree.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>The two new classes being added are the Hellfire Mage and the Steam Mechanic. The Hellfire Mage is pretty self-explanatory. It's the class to play if you want to inflict immense amounts of damage with fire attacks that can really burn anyone who tries to get in your way.</p>



<p>The Steam Mechanic relies on their equipment and ability for invention with steam-powered exoskeletons that help them deal with their foes. As stated previously, both the Hellfire Mage and Steam Mechanic classes will be exclusive to Dwarves before they're available for Human and Elf players sometime in the future. According to a press release from Fulqrum and Dreamate, they'll be available for other races "<em>through subsequent updates</em>."</p>



<p>When New Arc Line launched in early access last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/">Wccftech checked out the release</a>, which showed potential, but as is the case with any game in early access, New Arc Line had plenty of room to grow. "<em>You can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm eager to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey.</em>"</p>

          <p>Two key writers of HBO's series&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> are moving on, according to announcements on Instagram yesterday. Neil Druckmann, co-creator of the franchise, and Halley Gross, co-writer of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> and frequent writer on the show, are both leaving before work begins on season 3.</p>
<p>Both were credited as executive producers on the show; Druckmann frequently contributed writing to episodes, as did Gross, and Druckmann also directed. Druckmann and Gross co-wrote the second game, <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>.</p>
<p>Druckmann said in his announcement <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in <em>The Last of Us</em> on HBO. With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.</p>
<p>Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It’s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I’m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> and the continued adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Gross <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnVeDnPz9B/">said</a>:</p>

<section><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's massive success will likely influence future RPGs, but not every aspect should be taken as inspiration.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> took the gaming world by surprise when it became one of the best reviewed games of 2025 so far, and sold over 3.33 million copies. It hit levels of online conversation and praise often reserved for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Rings</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">Legend of Zeldas</a> of the world. Part of that praise has described Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as revitalizing the turn-based genre, something that isn't really true unless you only play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/" data-ref-id="5000-519018">Final Fantasy</a> games. But with the high praise from critics and positive reception from fans, it seems likely that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will influence future RPGs, and that can have both positive and negative repercussions. There are some aspects that maybe shouldn't be taken for other games, but there are systems in here that other RPG developers absolutely should learn from.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should steal character-specific combat mechanics</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526273-claircharactermechanics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526273-claircharactermechanics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526273"></a><figcaption>Sciel's foretell system creates a simple loop to build more complicated builds around.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526273-claircharactermechanics.jpg"></figure><p>On paper, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's use of character-specific combat mechanics just feels like a different version of classes or jobs in turn-based combat, but it goes beyond that. While a knight will excel at different aspects of combat than a mage, the flow of combat for each is typically either the same or has small differences, like the type of buffs and debuffs you can apply to each character.</p><p dir="ltr">The combat differences in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 go far beyond class differences, and allow for great class building as a result. For example, the way that Maelle's stance changing works encourages far different Lumina builds compared to Monocco or Lune, creating five characters that feel like distinct individuals, and not just class archetypes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should avoid parrying (yes, really)</h2><p dir="ltr">Parrying is fundamental to both Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's combat and success, as it offers an engaging way to actively participate in turn-based combat. Yet part of the reason that it works <em>is because it's</em> <em>fundamental</em>--the entire game is built around parrying enemies. Enemy movements, combat difficulty, and entire aspects of character builds are designed entirely around this system.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the popularity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" data-ref-id="5000-483352">Sekiro</a> and other FromSoftware games, parrying has become fairly commonplace in video games of late. This not only makes the mechanic feel far more stale than it should, but it has also made it easy to identify the two types of parry games. There are parry games like Sekiro and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that are built around parrying, and there are games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan/" data-ref-id="5000-561804">The First Berzerker: Khazan</a>, that have parrying, but aren't reliant upon the mechanic.</p><p dir="ltr">Sekiro and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 require parrying, and are designed around that. Enemies attack in ways meant to confuse your ability to parry, but always follow the same attack patterns, so they can be learned. In other experiences, parrying is a tool in your tool belt, and because you don't have to use it, enemy attack patterns can't be built with that in mind. It often becomes the most powerful move in that kind of game, since parrying deflects away attacks and will offer an opening for a strong attack. In those cases, parrying actually takes away from the other aspects of combat.</p><p dir="ltr">What RPG makers should take from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is that they should invest in combat systems that feature aspects that add depth and dynamism to turn-based games, and build around those features--not that they should just copy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's homework. Turn-based RPGs have been utilizing active elements for decades with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-rpg-legend-of-the-seven-stars/" data-ref-id="5000-17691">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-2004/" data-ref-id="5000-20445">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and the best examples share that purposeful use of active elements. Another turn-based game could use parrying successfully, but if it's just being tacked on because it's popular, the results won't be anywhere near as successful.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should steal more impactful equipment</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526276-clairparry.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526276-clairparry.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526276"></a><figcaption>Weapons having such impactful passives makes each one feel more unique than equipment in some other turn-based RPGs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4526276-clairparry.jpg"></figure><p>Weapons, Luminas, and Pictos are some of the more underrated aspects of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, as those systems allow for creative (and busted) combat builds. While I don't need these specifically lifted, nor do I need every RPG to allow me to break the combat with a busted build, I find that many RPG's equipment feels so simple that it's not worth thinking about beyond the numbers getting bigger.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapons in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 all have unique passive abilities that drastically change how you play. For example, the weapon I used with Sciel always applied the maximum amount of Foretell, instead of the amount listed on a skill. That allowed me to use skills with lower costs to apply Foretell, since I would always get the max, so I could use the savings to afford higher-cost abilities that apply extra damage based on Foretell, maximizing my damage. If I used a different weapon, I would have had to completely change my battle strategy. The way these aspects can drastically change your approach even to a single character offers so much more depth than many RPGs.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should avoid a complete lack of map markers</h2><p dir="ltr">The pushback against game world maps covered in objective markers has been going strong, reaching a fever pitch with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017, which opted to have few objective markers on its massive map. People against objective markers argue that they turn any amount of story-telling or exploration that could happen into you just going from one objective to the next, not engaging with the spaces in between.</p><p dir="ltr">The argument has been that not having map markers encourages exploration and discovery, and when implemented well, like in <em>Elden Ring</em>, it works wonders. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 does not have level design, nor overworld design, that works well with a lack of objective markers. The most successful examples are open-world games, but Clair Obscur features small, mostly linear levels. Even the side areas are usually short, winding areas, so instead of a lack of map markers leading to engaging exploration, it leads to you getting lost in these areas, as you can't always identify which way leads forward and which leads back once you get turned around.</p><p dir="ltr">The overworld map suffers not because it's easy to get lost, but because so many areas are best left to come back to. But once you reach the point where you want to go back, you'll realize you aren't sure which areas you've explored, and which ones you haven't. Without an in-game tracker, or even something as simple as stamps for the map, you're left to your memory or a checklist outside of the game, which can take you out of the story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">RPGs should steal fast intros</h2><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received high praise for its shorter runtime, clocking in somewhere between 24-60 hours, shorter than other high-profile turn-based RPGs, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/" data-ref-id="5000-590950">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" data-ref-id="5000-590944">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. While I think there is a place for RPGs of all lengths, there is an aspect of Clair Obscur's shorter run time that I do think other RPGs should steal.</p><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hits the ground running. You get a brief but really effective walk around the city of Lumiere at the start that provides tons of world-building to chew on, before quickly sending you out into the world. Turn-based RPGs can often spend a ton of time at the start, front-loading a ton of world-building, resulting in it taking a few hours to actually get into the rhythm of the game. Clair Obscur's fast intros not only provide a more enticing hook to stick around, but the faster pace also means that it doesn't have the time to overwhelm you with backstory and proper nouns. The slow introductions in other RPGs are often used to do a large amount of exposition and world-building, which can not only make for a slow start to the story, but can also overload you with information, making it difficult to actually digest.</p><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will continue to be a hot topic when it comes to games, especially in conversation with other RPGs. It has a great shot at making an appearance in many outlets' game of the year conversations, so it's likely to be on the mind of other developers for a while, too. But while there are plenty of great aspects of Clair Obscur to take inspiration from, hopefully not every element will make an appearance in future turn-based RPGs, and developers will put ingenuity first.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, independent developer Distinct Possibility Studios announced REAPER ACTUAL, an open world persistent first-person shooter game. The studio is led by a trio of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/planetside-2-interview-its-back-and-here-to-stay/">PlanetSide 2</a> developers: Matthew Higby, Trammel Isaac, and John Smedley. Indeed, the game seems to carry forward some of that game's unique MMO-like features.</p>



<p>Just like in PlanetSide 2, victories and defeats in PvP fights will reshape control of the game's island map in real time, but in REAPER ACTUAL, there are also NPCs to contend with. Players have a progression and crafting system to build the best gear, which stays in the world. There will be player-controlled strongholds that allow you to craft items, produce weapons, and defend your territory. The position must be fortified, because both NPC factions and other players can raid your base. </p>



<p>Distinct Possibility Studio also promises a dynamic Narrative Progression where handcrafted story arcs merge seamlessly with an in-game mission system. Players are constantly drawn into conflict against each other and the island’s relentless native factions. When it comes to combat, players will find that precision-focused gunplay, cover systems, and squad coordination are essential to victory. Just like in PlanetSide 2, there will be land, sea, and air vehicles, allowing for a combined arms experience. REAPER ACTUAL also features a player-driven economy, with players building not just guns, but gear as well, from night vision to goggles, communication devices, and vehicles.</p>



<p>Higby, Chief Creative Officer at Distinct Possibility, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We are moving toward the next level of persistent FPS combat. Players want a world they can live in and build upon. Having a solid base is only the start in REAPER ACTUAL. Once faction missions interweave with PvP combat, the world becomes a swirling battleground of options for players. Mix that with a full crafting system and Reapers will grow every time you log in to play.</em></p>

<p>The only caveat is that <span>a standalone version of the game will integrate the Etherlink blockchain to allow for trading of in-game assets. According to the developer, this won't affect the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995670/Reaper_Actual/" target="_blank">Steam</a>&nbsp;or Epic Game</span>s Store versions. Although no release window is imminent, the store pages already include the minimum and recommended system requirements for REAPER ACTUAL.</p>

Her entire premise is to be a deliberate remix of his story, an exploration of the parallels between both of their worlds, and she is at the center of one of the most compelling “what if” scenarios in comic books.

The idea was for some teams to work on different parts of the game to create one larger package. <em>BF6 </em>is reported to include a free-to-play mode, multiple premium online options, and even a full single-player suite as well as a community-driven game mode. But this plan has reportedly led to tension between Dice, the original creators of <em>Battlefield</em>, and EA leadership, who have taken more control over the next entry after <em>2042 </em>flopped out of the gate.</p><h2 id="h487516"><a id=""></a>The high cost of making the next <em>Battlefield </em></h2><p>EA’s desire to compete with <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Call of Duty,</em> while building something this big across so many teams located in different parts of the world, has reportedly led to a ballooning budget. <em>Ars Techinca</em>’s sources claim<em> Battlefield 6</em>'s budget is over $400 million.

But will it be enough for EA after it has spent all this money? And will the people who worked so hard on this game see any reward or stability after <em>BF6 </em>launches?

In this vacation paradise, users can take in the sights across different colorful biomes while completing quests, challenging others for higher leaderboard spots, and purchasing cosmetic items. It all revolves around one goal: collect as many eggs as possible.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Roblox The Hatch Event - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each painted collectible isn’t found in The Hatch itself, though. Instead, players use the official Roblox hub world to transport themselves to other user-created Roblox experiences via portals placed around the map. Each portal features around 40 games that range from Squid Game obstacle courses to anime-inspired fighting simulators. These are where the eggs can be found, and while they’re often not particularly well hidden, The Hatch and Easter Egg hunts in general have proven to be enticing events that get Roblox players engaged with experiences they know and some they don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hundreds of Roblox games are included in The Hatch, cementing the event as a crucial limited-time mode with official backing from Roblox Corporation. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/98209635344835/The-Hatch#!/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Hatch’s page</u></a> had more than 46 million visits at the time of this piece’s publication.

It was an exciting moment marred by controversy when players caught wind that infamous (and verified) Roblox developer TheOfficiaITeddy had been invited to include his creations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox is a free-to-play platform that is no doubt used by countless children every day, yet, nearly 20 years into its lifespan, Roblox Corporation still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">finds itself facing accusations that it’s cultivated a dangerous environment for younger players</a>. TheOfficiaITeddy is one developer at the center of the conversation surrounding these topics thanks to his involvement in what many call “condo” games. These social experiences allow players to mingle with one another, but it’s the allegations that Teddy’s condo experiences have featured romantic, dating, and even sex-themed content that have the community ready to take action.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This person has gained HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of visits on games that can only be described as s*x games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“This person has gained HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of visits on games that can only be described as s*x games,” one popular post from X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/RoCatchers/status/1934826140046074014" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@RoCatchers</u></a> said. “These games feature inappropriate animations disguised as innocent stuff, and people within the games use it for lewd acts.

The company explained that, during its absence, it conducted an investigation into Teddy that involved an attempt to alter experiences that complied with its <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Community Standards</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the console release of the co-op tactical shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ready-or-not">Ready or Not</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/tactical-shooter-ready-or-not-is-coming-to-consoles-this-summer-whether-youre-ready-or-not/">just around the corner</a>, developer Void Interactive has ended up in a bit of a pickle, as the PC community has taken to review bombing the game over content changes aiming to meet the policies of global platforms and age rating bodies.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337">Providing new side-by-side and very specific details</a>, Void Interactive insist that these are “minor content changes” being made so that they can have one unified set of assets and features to better support the full cross-play between platforms. The game will still be as gory and violent as ever, and it will still feature full limb dismemberment (albeit now only for characters while they are alive), and many levels are completely unchanged.</p>


<p>Where Void is making changes in in removing nudity – video game ratings are often totally fine with killing hundreds of people, but showing a bit of a boob? That’s not OK. So a number of characters that had nudity or exposed genitals now have underwear on. There’s also one instance where a child is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing, and one collectable piece of evidence that is now generic photographic evidence instead of “Photo of Minors” with a pile of children’s photographed faces.</p>
<p>All in all, this feels like a storm in a teacup. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483260567">Void Interactive was up front about the incoming changes</a> and described their intent last week, and has now provided side-by-side comparisons on Steam.</p>
<p>Here’s the six specific visual changes that Void are making to the PC version of Ready or Not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twisted Nerve: The girl is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing. &nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>A Lethal Obsession: Nudity involving the ghillie suit suspect has been adjusted&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Hide and Seek: Female hostages now wear underwear&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Narcos: Police informant hostage now wears underwear&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>23 Megabytes a Second: ‘Photo of Minors’ objective model was revised, also to better connect narratively with the later ‘Sinuous Trail’ mission. <wbr></li>
<li>Post-mortem dismemberment has been disabled (note: dismemberment for living characters remains unchanged)</li>
</ul>
<p>Scanning through the comments, there’s still an awful lot of people decrying what they view as naked censorship, and there’s plenty others who are more accepting.</p>
<p>In the original statement, Void wrote, “The changes with the console version are small enough that most people here wouldn’t notice if we didn’t say anything, but we want to be transparent. It’s largely just evidence and nudity that’s altered, and the texture changes don’t affect the PC version.”<wbr></p>
<p>This is absolutely the kind of thing that happens constantly behind the scenes when games, films, TV shows go to the ratings boards. There’s plenty of public back-and-forth discussions for the creation of South Park, for example, as the show’s creators bargain with lawyers over what they will and won’t tweak and change. For Void, this is just being done out in the open and after release.</p>
<p>The difficulty is trying to apply this globally, and similar examples might include Conan: Exiles, where the console version removed nudity to avoid an AO (Adults Only) rating and receive an M in the US. There have also been games that received an AO rating purely for the tone of their violence – such as Hatred in 2015, where you are a mass murdering villain. Ready or Not has received <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40312/ready-or-not/">an M rating in the US</a>, with the listing mentioning nudity, but has an restricted 18+ rating in Australia from the PC version, which Void could be trying to reduce. It could also be the platform holders applying their own judgments.</p>
<p>Ready of Not is going to launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 15th July.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation</a> of the long-awaited ZeniMax Online Studios (ZOS from now on) MMORPG codenamed Project Blackbird and the subsequent departure of studio founder and head Matt Firor shocked the development team, which is understandably still reeling. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1940751846064443838?t=Dwxr4abCb3L_nCifN6JyUA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hundreds of developers lost their jobs</a>, including ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who had worked at the company for over ten years and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-tech-qa-improved-next-gen-usage-better-hdr-multithreaded-rendering-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a> in an exclusive The Elder Scrolls Online tech interview with Wccftech in August 2021. Following the dire news, Tardif <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346200504034623489/">shared</a> some thoughts on LinkedIn, stating that the MMORPG was 'heading in a great direction' and the new engine he and the other graphics programmers had been working on had 'found its footing'.</p>



<p><em>Our project got cancelled. We'd been working on a new engine + MMO for some time now, and despite some troubles along the way, the project was heading in a great direction and our tech had found its footing. Of the high notes of our tech was undoubtedly our new renderer, made by one of the best damn graphics teams around. If you see any of them looking for work in the coming days/weeks, they have my full throttled endorsement. An entire team of humble, hardworking, self motivated and passionate devs bleeding with talent. You could not go wrong hiring any of them.</em></p>



<p>Now, I'm the first to be entirely flummoxed at the news. As someone who spent thousands of hours in The Elder Scrolls Online, I was very much looking forward to this new game by ZOS, and I'm extremely sad about all the job cuts. On the other hand, if one wanted to play devil's advocate for a second, it is also true that the project had been cooking for over seven years and they didn't have anything to show for it, at least to the public. Even the fact that tech had just about 'found its footing' isn't exactly inspiring in that regard - likely, Microsoft decided that they weren't willing to spend any more resources on such a slow-going project.</p>



<p>Again, though, it's a shame, as so few triple-A MMORPGs are being built nowadays. We're down to less than a handful that are being worked on by Western developers now.</p>
