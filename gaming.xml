            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shake-up for TT Games' LEGO series, the newly-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> features just a handful of playable heroes, even if many more DC Comics characters will appear in the game as enemies or NPCs — something that is prompting plenty of fan debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, TT Games' LEGO adventures include hundreds of characters to unlock and play as, with character collection a fun part of fully completing a LEGO game. TT Games' previous project LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga offered one of the biggest rosters yet — with around 400 characters depending on whether you owned the base game or all of its DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is taking a different approach, however, with an official Q&amp;A page for the game confirming just seven heroes will be playable — and no supervillains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will feature seven playable characters, including Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul," reads the game's official <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q&amp;A</a>. "Each character is equipped with unique skills, combos, and gadgets — like Batman's Batclaw, Jim Gordon's foam sprayer, Robin's line launcher, and Catwoman's whip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes it sound like the game's focus is on providing a smaller number of distinct characters, rather than hundreds of options with many gameplay similarities. Indeed, speaking to IGN at Gamescom, TT Games Head of Production Jonathan Smith said Legacy of the Dark Knight had been designed to focus more squarely on the story of the "Bat Family."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is wholly a Batman game to focus on that character, to really bring that character," Smith said. "That means you'll still play as and with other playable characters, Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, to round out the bat family. But we think we really need to focus on Bruce Wayne and his story for that player journey, that player experience in Gotham."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for collectathon fans, the game's seven characters will have multiple costumes to unlock. For example, Batman's suit options include his look from 2022's The Batman movie, the animated Batman: The Brave and the Bold series, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, Batman's original Golden Age comics appearance, plus well as his colorful Rainbow Batman suit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/21/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gameplay-00-02-59-1755792967121.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Batman's Suit Options screen includes numerous unlockable appearances.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On stage at Gamescom this week, Smith confirmed the appearance of multiple characters from DC Comics within the game, including Bat-Mite and Condiment King — though to be clear, these will not be playable. Bat-Mite sounds likely to pop up as a friendly NPC, while Condiment King feels most likely to be another non-playable villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(As a side-note, Smith also said that Superman and Peacemaker would not appear in Legacy of the Dark Knight, and gave a "no comment" to Harley Quinn, Bob the Goon, Terry McGinnis, "Nice Coat Guy from Batman Begins," and amusingly, Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it’s only seven in the whole game then I’m not buying lol," one fan wrote in a lengthy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1mur2go/lego_batman_will_have_only_7_playable_characters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread discussing the seven character limit. "Honestly shocked by this," wrote another, adding that "part of the fun of LEGO games is the big rosters."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Controversial opinion: I prefer seven completely different characters to play than 200 that only change their appearance," countered another fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said another: "I understand what made the huge minifig rosters cool and neat but I don't think it made for a better game over more refined play patterns that are super character specific instead of a handful of interchangeable abilities and tools."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have said this approach better fits a more story-led game, though others remain of the opinion that more LEGO characters should be playable in the game's open-world version of Gotham. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>What do you have when you take cozy cooking games with monster fighting? You have the cleverly titled Beastro, from Timberline Studios. This upcoming game combines cooking game mechanics, laidback farming, and strategic deckbuilding combat to deliver a fresh take on the adventure genre. In Beastro, the idea of saving the world begins with preparing the perfect meal.</p><p>Set to launch in 2026 on Steam and Xbox Series X|S (available day one with Xbox Game Pass), Beastro follows Panko, a young fox and chef who suddenly finds himself in charge of a village eatery after his mentor mysteriously disappears.</p><p>As Panko, players will manage the restaurant, grow ingredients on the farm, forage in the wild, and serve local patrons. But there's more to Panko’s new role--he also must feed the Caretakers, adventurers who are the last line of defense against looming threats beyond the village walls. You can check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ3NM3hZD1Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fZ3NM3hZD1Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each Caretaker comes from a different "flavor region" that influences their taste preferences and battle style. Some prefer sweet dishes, while others crave something bitter or spicy. By mastering a variety of cooking minigames and carefully crafting meals to match each adventurer's palate, players can boost their strength, unlock new cards for their deck, and prepare themselves for the battles ahead. The better the meal, the more effective the Caretakers become in combat against the monstrous threats.</p><p>After every expedition, the action continues in the form of a puppet show that reenacts the Caretakers' adventures. These turn-based battle sequences require tactical thinking and showcase the impact of the meals prepared earlier. From there, the Caretaker brings back the spoils of victory, which Panko can use for future meals.</p><p>Players can wishlist the game or register for updates on the <a href="https://www.beastro.game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f313d46b13da/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>It would come as no surprise to hear that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is one of the most successful indie games of all time, right? An immensely popular Switch launch (a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/hollow_knight_sold_over_a_quarter_of_a_million_copies_on_switch_in_two_weeks">quarter of a million sales</a> in its first two weeks) and six years of waiting for one of the most hyped-up sequels ever is bound to do that. But it turns out that the melancholic metroidvania has sold even better than we expected.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellan stated that Hollow Knight has sold around <em>15 million copies</em> since it launched back in 2017. 2.8 million of these sales came before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> was announced in 2019, and an additional 12 million have come in the years since, the devs stated.</p>
<p>For reference, that puts Hollow Knight's sales numbers roughly in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> (which had amassed 14.83 million units sold by the last official count in 2023). Of course, not all of Hollow Knight's purchases will have come from Switch, but still, it's in line with a <em>Pokémon game</em>.</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg feature, the game's continued success has meant that the team has been able to continue to work on Silksong without having to worry about finances. “We’re very lucky in that regard,” Gibson told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, “I don’t ever really think about it that much. Maybe that’s the privilege of it”.</p>
<p>Compare that to the development of Hollow Knight, where the team was reportedly living off leftover office sandwiches and the odd $20 top-up from parents, and it's plain to see just how far the studio has come between games.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed it, Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>4th September</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-cherry-is-already-working-on-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-new-report-details-why-silksong-took-six-years-to-make.1277433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry, developer of Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight Silksong, the latter of which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">finally have a release date for</a>, is already working on DLC for Silksong, the team confirmed in an interview that went live alongside Silksong's launch date news. The report also delved into why Team Cherry took as long as they did to make Silksong, with the answer more or less being that they were having too much fun working on the game.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, the studio's co-founders, Ari Gibson and William Pellen admitted that "<em>We’ve been having fun</em>. <em>This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things</em>," said Pellen.</p>



<p>Gibson added that the team never hit a wall with development. Silksong's long journey to release wasn't a result of a complicated development process that involved them overhauling the game and having to re-do major parts of it, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">BioShock 4</a> is currently going through. Instead, it came down to the fact that they just kept adding more to the game, and the more they added, the more work was involved in ensuring it was at a level of polish on par with their standards and everything else in the game. </p>



<p>Also, Team Cherry never expanded to a massive team, and keeping things small also played a key part in how long everything took.</p>



<p>"<em>Even at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of </em><em>Hollow Knight</em> or probably exceed it,<em>" </em>said Gibson. "<em>And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.</em>"</p>



<p>Another key part of why Silksong took as long as it did is that Team Cherry had all the runway it needed for six, seven, or even 15 years, with Hollow Knight confirmed to have sold <strong>over 15 million copies</strong> since its launch in 2017. That kind of indie success can keep a small team working and fed for a long time, with Gibson and Pellen even admitting that they're only finally launching the game "<em>for the sake of just completing the game."</em></p>



<p>"<em>I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," </em>Gibson continued. "<em>Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’</em>"</p>



<p>And if you're remembering the times where we were sure that Silksong was ready, only for it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/">delayed</a>, Gibson and Pellen say that at the time, they truly believed it would have been out, if not for the fact that, as previously mentioned, their small team and amount of content required they take their time to ensure everything was at their standards. In fact, the last two years of the game's development have been spent just on polishing and bug squashing, pun intended.</p>



<p>All together, Bloomberg's report is the exact kind of story you'd want to hear about an indie studio like Team Cherry. Instead of being burnt out, they're just as excited as they were six years ago to keep working on the game. That's why they already have DLC in development. They've only been so quiet about the game because they didn't want to "<em>sour"</em> any excitement around it, since any update we could've gotten was that they were still working on it.</p>



<p>Also, if after all this time and all this excitement, you still feel cautious about Silksong and wanted to wait for reviews on it, know that you'll be waiting well after release, since Team Cherry thought it would be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">"<em>unfair</em>"</a> to those who backed the game on Kickstarter years ago if critics got the chance to play it ahead of everyone else, and won't be sending out pre-release codes for reviews.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong will be out on PC, current and last-gen consoles in just two weeks, on September 4, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-announces-game-system-west-marches-style-gameplay-and-all-13</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, after teasing the<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-campaign-4-setting-through-community-solved-arg" rel="nofollow"> announcement via an extensive ARG</a>, Critical Role released a video that answers almost every question that fans have had in the lead-up to Critical Role Campaign 4. This video sets the scene for the world of Araman, highlights all thirteen player characters, and goes into explaining West March-style <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D</a></em> games and how Brennan is going to use it to tell a story at a scale he's never been able to before.</p>


<p>First and foremost it was confirmed that Campaign 4 of Critical Role will use the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2024)</em> ruleset. These new rules, initially introduced last year, feature a number of balancing changes, new subclasses, and a whole host of new rules and interactions. It was specifically pointed out that there would be some homebrew added to the system, interestingly enough this is provided in conjunction with Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins who led the 2024 ruleset project at Wizards of the Coast and recently started at Darrington Press.</p>

<p>In terms of players, the final list of cast for Campaign 4, not including Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM, is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Laura Bailey</li>
	<li>Taliesin Jaffe</li>
	<li>Ashley Johnson</li>
	<li>Matthew Mercer</li>
	<li>Liam O’Brien</li>
	<li>Marisha Ray</li>
	<li>Sam Riegel</li>
	<li>Travis Willingham</li>
	<li>Luis Carazo</li>
	<li>Robbie Daymond</li>
	<li>Aabria Iyengar</li>
	<li>Whitney Moore</li>
	<li>Alex Ward</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-cast.jpg?itok=TB-M6B7i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-cast.jpg?itok=r05seXk9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the video, it is explained that after a four-episode 'Overture', where all of the Cast Members will be introduced and feature in intersecting scenes, the tables will split among three themes; Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers. Throughout the campaign they will continue to tie in together "with overarching themes and genres."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When creating the worlds that we build and explore in all of our content at Critical Role, we have always held strong to the belief that we should use the system that best supports the story we want to tell,&nbsp;We are certainly spoiled for choice when it comes to TTRPG systems that the cast knows and loves, so we are very excited to explore more of both Daggerheart and Dungeons and Dragons in our near (and hopefully distant) future.<br>
- Marisha Ray,&nbsp;Creative Director, co-founder, and cast member of Critical Role</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the video we also got a peek of scenes from gameplay, a new Critical Role set, and plenty of behind the scenes footage of the players all gathered around the table or working in meeting rooms rolling dice.</p>

<p>Critical Role Campaign 4 will premier on October 2nd on Beacon.tv as well as Critical Role's YouTube and Twitch. The VOD will be available for the public the following Monday. Interestingly, for Podcast listeners the episodes will be broken up into two parts. The first will be available the week after airing, and the second part on the subsequent Tuesday. This will create a rhythm where every 3-4 days you'll get a bit more Critical Role, but it does create a strange scenario that even a free YouTube watcher will have access to episode 1 and 2 before a podcast listener will have access to the entirety of episode 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It actually happened: <em>Silksong</em>, the standalone sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">has a release date</a>. After seven years in development, and almost as many shrouded in silence, the game is coming out on September 4th. It’s welcome news for the millions of <em>Hollow Knight</em> fans who have been impatiently waiting. But it’s also part of a welcome trend: 2025 is shaping up to be the year that several long in-development games finally see the light of day.</p><div><p>Joining <em>Silksong</em> later this year will be <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. While it doesn’t have a specific release date, the shooter is part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule">Nintendo’s steady stream of releases for the first year of the Switch 2</a>. The game has been in development so long it’s releasing on both versions of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017">It was first announced in 2017</a> but in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">Nintendo said that it was rebooting development of the game</a>, with original <em>Prime</em> studio Retro taking over the project. Five years went by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">before the game appeared again</a>, with the new subtitle <em>Beyond</em>, and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">it was confirmed as a Switch 2 title</a>.</p></div><div><p>The development of <em>Routine</em> from Lunar Software has been similarly protracted. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3507340/routine-sci-fi-horror-game">I originally wrote about this ‘80s style indie horror game in 2012</a>, and at one point it had been planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/1/13486328/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-launch-date-trailer">a 2016 launch</a>. That obviously didn’t happen, and six years later the game was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wpvT6uDDQ">re-revealed</a>” with a new trailer and the news that Swedish label Raw Fury would be publishing it. Then, earlier this week, slightly hidden amongst <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760975/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-news-trailers">all of the trailers and reveals during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live keynote</a>, was confirmation that barring any more delays, <em>Routine</em> would be launching later in 2025.</p></div><p>While both <em>Routine</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> seem to have suffered from the technical and design difficulties that can plague the development of big, complex games — at one point Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi called <em>Metroid</em>‘s development “very challenged” — that hasn’t been the case for <em>Silksong</em>. It’s just a game being built by a small team who were able to take a slow and steady approach. “It was never stuck or anything,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?srnd=undefined">Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “It was always progressing. It’s just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it.”</p><p>Of course, there’s another long-in-the-works game that was originally slated to launch in 2025 but has since been pushed back: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Rockstar released the first trailer for the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">at the end of 2023</a>, a decade after the launch of <em>GTAV</em>, and initially planned to release <em>VI</em> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">the fall of this year</a>. It’s now supposed to come out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">on May 26th, 2026</a>, so fans will have to continue to wait for that one.</p><p>But even without the blockbuster behemoth that is <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, this year will be one that satiates many fans who have been eagerly awaiting a specific game. You could even throw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch">the latest chapters of <em>Deltarune</em></a> on to that list. The real question is, with all of these games finally coming out, what’s next to obsess over? Is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017">the sequel to <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> really still alive? When will <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s creator launch his next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739112/stardew-valley-creator-concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier-announcement-trailer-gameplay"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>? Will <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> get its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23279810/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-kotor-remake-development-on-pause">announced remake</a> — or will <em>Bloodborne</em> get one at all? What’s up with the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> and <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Let’s hope for more good news in 2026.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/763698/delayed-games-silksong-metroid-prime-4-2025#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/763698/delayed-games-silksong-metroid-prime-4-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ttk-shotgun-jumping-sliding-nerf-changes-open-beta-ea-patch-notes-2000619184</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-toning-down-the-wild-jumps-and-slides-seen-in-the-open-beta.1277421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The recent<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em> Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta was a massive success for EA and Battlefield Studios, amassing over half a million concurrent players on Steam. But some players weren’t happy about how fast and jumpy movement could be in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">online FPS</a>, and others felt the shotgun was too powerful. Now EA has announced that hopping around with a shotty won’t be as effective in the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">On August 21, EA and Battlefield Studios published a lengthy community update</a> on Twitter going over what was learned from the beta and what will be changed when the full game launches in October. The big news for many will be that, yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/battlefield-6-beta-call-of-duty-ttk/">the devs working on <em>BF6</em> saw some of those wild videos</a> of players hopping, sliding, and diving around in matches <a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-2-movement-exploit-warzone-2-1849810446">like it’s a modern<em> Call of Duty</em> game</a> and have plans to nerf how fast you slide and how often you can jump.</p> <p>“Movement mechanics have been adjusted to create a more balanced and traditional <em>Battlefield</em> experience,” said EA in the community update post.&nbsp; “Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced. There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy.”</p>

 <p>According to the devs, the idea behind these changes is to make jumping and sliding “more situational” and less useful during gunfights, with EA adding that it wants to reward “skillful movement” but doesn’t want gameplay to become “too fast or unpredictable.”</p> <h2>The shotgun in <em>Battlefield 6</em> is being nerfed</h2> <p>Another complaint out of the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta was that the shotgun carried by assault class players was too powerful. As someone who loved using the shotgun, I disagree entirely and think people need to shut up. But the data does show that the shotgun was very effective at killing people. Maybe too effective? EA thinks so and is nerfing it a bit, explaining: “The M87A1 shotgun now requires more pellets to secure a kill.” So it will still be good up close, but won’t be the powerhouse at medium range like it was in the beta.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619192">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Other weapon tweaks include a “general pass on recoil” and tap-firing across all weapons. EA wants to emphasize each gun’s “unique feel” and make sure weapons have more varied effective ranges.&nbsp; “We’ve also made changes to encourage more controlled tap-firing and burst-firing, rewarding precision and weapon mastery,” said the team.</p>

 <p>And EA is “investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences” in <em>BF6</em>, but doesn’t have any “definitive” plans yet. Personally, I think people were being weird about time-to-kill in <em>BF6</em>‘s beta, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mltikj/bf6_vs_bf4_ttk_and_sprint_speed/">as it is about the same as it was in <em>BF4</em>.</a> But I do agree that sometimes you’d die instantly, and it felt like only one shot. I assume this is down to some network issues that need to be fixed.</p> <h2>Player counts, Rush changes, and more</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the community update, Battlefield Studios talked more about player counts and how they work in <em>BF6</em>. The devs say the number of players in a match isn’t strictly dictated by the mode, but the scale of the map. For example, at launch, some Breakthrough maps will support 48 players, while others will support 64 players. It’s an interesting strategy that lets the devs use every map for every mode, even if it means upping or lowering the maximum number of players that can get in on the action.</p>

 <p>EA also talked about Rush and how the more players you add to the mode, the harder it becomes for one side to win. So, based on player feedback from the beta, EA is lowering the default number of players in Rush in the full game in October to give attackers a better chance of winning. Hopefully, the studio also changes where players spawn and how close the objectives are in Rush to help make <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">matches more fun and less of a slog</a>.</p> <p>Oh, and for players who are part of BF Labs, you’ll get a chance to test out some of the bigger maps coming to <em>BF6</em> at launch, including the remake of<em> BF3</em>‘s beloved Operation Firestorm. EA confirmed that these two maps will “include the full complement of vehicles…along with a more vast combat space.” So you can stop yelling at EA and <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs about bigger maps. They’ve told you before and now have explained again: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">Bigger maps will be in the full game</a>. Relax, okay?</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on October 10 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next season is bringing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending hero</span></a><span>, some major overhauls to its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><span>build-based Stadium mode</span></a><span>, and new Perks for every character on the roster. I’m not here to talk about all that. I’m here to talk about the collaboration I could not have fathomed that was teased at the very end of the hero shooter’s latest trailer. Blizzard and Atlus have worked out a deal to put skins based on </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>characters in the hero shooter. What a world we live in.</span></p> <p><span>I do not care for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908"><span>the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>-ification of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span>, which has</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277"><span>become such a core part of Blizzard’s strategy</span></a><span> these days, so even though </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>is one of my favorite video game series of all time, I’m not particularly thrilled that this collaboration is happening. That said, I am morbidly curious as to what this collaboration ends up looking like. The brief clip at the end of the trailer shows someone dressed as Joker, the main character of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>, but we only see them depicted as a silhouette, so it’s unclear who is beneath the mask. Could it be Wuyang, the new support hero joining the roster this season? That doesn’t seem like that much of a stretch. Beyond the mysterious Joker skin, we don’t know if this is strictly a </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration or if we’ll see skins based on characters from other games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><i><span>Persona 3</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-4-golden-pc-is-the-definitive-edition-of-a-damn-1844024943"><i><span>4</span></i></a><span>. Blizzard could throw a real curveball in there and have cosmetics based on characters from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-two-persona-games-exist-atlus-admits-1847283391"><span>often-forgotten first two games</span></a><span>. The teaser does include what seems to be a new Play of the Game animation made to look like Joker’s All-Out Attack victory pose, so it looks like we’ll get more than just skins during the event.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Season 18: Stadium Quick Play Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2nwpbXoDdY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Beyond turning Overwatch into Phantom Thieves, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s season 18 is adding new modes and characters to Stadium, as well as allowing you to play it in Quickplay rather than just in ranked modes. This way, you won’t have to worry about losing your rank if you have a bad match or two. Stadium is already one of the biggest time sinks in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> and going through an entire game just to lose your rank feels bad, so this is a good alternative. In the main game, every hero is getting at least one new ability-altering Perk they can choose between over the course of a match. Some will be getting more than one new Perk, however, as Blizzard plans to rework more than 50 across all characters.</span></p> <p><span>Lastly, Blizzard released a new animated trailer for Wuyang that gives us more insight into his family dynamics and also might tease that his sister, the fire-wielding Anran, may join the roster at some point down the line.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Elemental Kin | Wuyang Hero Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytZnOGwEq9s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Season 18 begins on August 26.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After much speculation, Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection has revealed its full lineup of games at Gamescom 2025. The collection plans to remaster many of the original Mortal Kombat titles, including the first ever game in the series.</p>



<p>While the series has been going strong since 1992, there weren’t many ways to play the originals on modern consoles. Now, with Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, you can now play many of the older titles all in one place and with better graphics and controls. We knew that the game would at least cover the first three Mortal Kombat titles, but now we have the full roster.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-brings-11-games-to-modern-consoles">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Brings 11 Games to Modern Consoles</h2>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As per the Gamescom trailer, shown above, 11 games from the franchise, ranging from 1992’s Mortal Kombat to 2003’s Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition, will be available. Surprisingly, two games in its lineup, Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces, are some of the rarest to find and play, so longtime fans can finally get a chance to enjoy those games. The full roster of Mortal Kombat games can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mortal Kombat (1992)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat II (1993)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</li>



<li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 4 (1997) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Special Forces (2000) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat Advance (2001)</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002) </li>



<li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition (2003)</li>
</ul>



<p>No set release date has been announced for Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, but it is slated to release in 2025. However, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-accidentally-revealed/">a leaked Xbox store date</a> is real, it may come out on September 29th, 2025. The collection (or Kollection, as they say) will release on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In a brief developer preview, Bethesda showed off the upcoming C.A.M.P. Revamp update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-76/" data-ref-id="5000-482770">Fallout 76</a>. This update is geared towards making improvements to the game's CAMP-building mechanics as well as refining the workshop menu system.</p><p dir="ltr">As seen in the video below, Bethesda's creative director Jon Rush discussed the CAMP Revamp update, showing off the new streamlined menus to help make finding specific items faster. There are also new tools and new building rules.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlz9Bqp26BU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hlz9Bqp26BU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We're getting rid of our rules regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free-place anywhere," Rush said.

<p>While the Switch 1 version goes MIA</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Amazon Games and Glowmade have announced that their hack-and-slash co-op party platformer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/king_of_meat">King of Meat</a>, will be heading to Switch 2 in "<strong>early 2026</strong>".</p>
<p>This one was initially announced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-every-nintendo-switch-game-reveal-and-trailer">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, and it even popped up in this year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">March Nintendo Direct</a> with a 2025 Switch 1 release window. That date wasn't meant to be, clearly, and it looks like the console might not have been either. While the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series have landed 7th October release dates, and the Switch 2 has been given a rough window, we've been told that there's no more information on a Switch 1 release for the moment. So, keep holding out hope for that one... we guess.</p>
<p>But enough pessimism — a Switch 2 release is good news! King of Meat is all about silliness, tasking you and a group of three other pals to make your way through a series of developer- and community-created dungeons in the hopes of racking up fame in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p>There's a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque energy to the puzzle platforming, and a decent arsenal of weapons and upgrades to make the hacky, slashy combat feel nice to pull off.</p>

<p>Amazon Games has announced that a King of Meat Technical Test will be taking place on PS5, Xbox Series and Steam from 23rd-24th August at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST / 7pm CET, to check that everything is running as it should and open the floor to player feedback. This won't be available on Switch 2, but it hopefully means that things should be in tip-top condition by the time that it comes our way.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-king-of-meat-fun-and-foolish-hack-and-slash-with-a-side-of-mario-maker">hands-on</a> with the PC build of King of Meat last year and had a perfectly fun time with it — despite our worries that the Switch 1 wouldn't be able to keep up with everything happening on screen. Assuming that the Switch 2 fares a little better, this could provide some pleasant party platforming next year.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-xbox-handheld-is-a-good-first-step-towards-a-windows-gaming-os.1277385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first thing I did when I got my hands on the Xbox Ally was reboot it. I wanted to see exactly how Microsoft manages to hide Windows beneath the Xbox interface that’s debuting on these handheld devices.</p><p>After a short startup<strong>,</strong> I was met with the standard Windows login prompt. But I could use the controller to input the PIN code, an immediate improvement over what’s available right now. And as soon as Windows 11 loaded up, the interface immediately disappeared. The Xbox PC app took over and went full-screen — and for the most part, I didn’t have to leave.</p><p>I’ve spent enough time with Microsoft and Asus’ Xbox Ally devices this week to get a better understanding of how Windows and Xbox are moving closer together. Microsoft has created what it calls an Xbox full-screen experience for these new handheld devices, which essentially takes over for Windows and hides the OS away. It’s exactly what I’ve been wanting for Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs for years now, but it still feels like a small first step in a grand next-gen Xbox plan.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Game Bar drives a lot of Microsoft’s Xbox full-screen experience.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The main interface on the Xbox Ally is similar to what can be found in the current Xbox app on Windows 11, Microsoft’s Steam competitor on PC. This app integrates with the Game Bar, Microsoft’s PC gaming overlay, to form this full-screen Xbox experience. Just like an Xbox console, you activate this Game Bar from a single tap of the Xbox button, and it’s what keeps you far away from the complexities of the Windows desktop hidden underneath.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t load the desktop wallpaper, the taskbar, or a bunch of other processes that you don’t need for gaming. It’s essentially not loading the Explorer shell and saving around 2GB of memory by suppressing all the unnecessary parts of a typical Windows 11 installation. It’s surprisingly easy to get back to a regular Windows experience on these Xbox Ally devices, though.</p><p>You can exit out of the Xbox full-screen experience through the Game Bar or hold the Xbox button down to access the task switcher and a shortcut to the Windows desktop. Microsoft warns that you’re exiting to the Windows desktop and that you should use touch or a mouse and keyboard “for the best experience.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Xbox task switcher lets you get to the Windows desktop quickly.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Windows desktop experience is exactly the same as any regular handheld, and the Xbox team hasn’t done much additional work here to improve this side of the Xbox Ally. You’ll still have to use this part of the device to install and configure Windows apps like Discord and Steam, but once they’re up and running, you can mostly stay within the handheld-optimized confines of the Xbox full-screen experience. It’s easy to connect to Bluetooth devices or Wi-Fi networks here, and if all you’re doing is gaming, then Microsoft has nailed most of the basics, thanks to the widgets in the Game Bar.</p><p>Switching back and forth between Windows and Xbox modes is relatively quick, but after switching into the Windows desktop mode just once, you’ll need to fully reboot the device to regain the 2GB of allocated RAM. You also have the option to keep switching between both modes without those performance savings.</p><p>While the handheld-optimized Xbox UI on the Xbox Ally devices is a great improvement over what exists today, I still fear the complexity of Windows will creep through during daily use. This is still a Windows 11 device after all, which means there are OS updates and notifications from other apps or storefronts to install that might break the immersion.</p><p>For example, while the Xbox app takes over the left-hand swipe gesture to activate the Game Bar, the right-hand swipe still activates the Windows 11 notification center, which looks out of place in the Xbox UI. The Xbox team is working to improve this, but it highlights the challenges of trying to hide Windows beneath a console-like UI.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can switch between the Xbox and Windows modes easily.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There’s also an interesting setting that suggests you’ll be able to set something other than the Xbox app as the default boot experience on the Xbox Ally devices, potentially opening the door for Steam or other launchers to become the home app here. Microsoft wouldn’t comment on what this setting is for just yet.</p><p>Due to my limited time with the Xbox Ally devices, it’s difficult to judge just how much switching between the Windows desktop and this full-screen Xbox experience you’d have to do on a daily basis. If you install Steam, then Microsoft brings any games you install from Valve’s store into the library interface of the Xbox app, making it a launcher for these PC games and keeping you in the handheld-friendly UI. But I did play some <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> on one of the demo units on the floor and noticed the game crash, leaving me with a broken game app window instead of a more gracious home screen like you see when games crash on an Xbox Series X console.</p><p>I also ran into a UI bug switching into the Windows desktop, which Microsoft assures me will be fixed by the time these devices ship on October 16th. Asus’ own devices on the Gamescom floor also had some weird bugs, including not being able to use the Xbox button at times. There’s clearly some work needed ahead of release.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to fully test how Windows standby and hibernation work with games on the Xbox Ally. I love the experience of turning my Xbox Series X off and then being able to immediately resume a game hours or days later, and Microsoft doesn’t have the equivalent of Quick Resume on Windows devices.</p><p>This experience feels like a first step in Microsoft’s plans for the next-gen Xbox, and seeing it in action makes it even clearer to me that Windows will be at the heart of the next Xbox console. Microsoft still has a tremendous amount of work ahead to blend all the best parts of Windows and Xbox together, but it’s about to ship some improvements that will hopefully lead to a gaming-optimized Windows operating system that spans across handhelds, consoles, and PCs.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is finally improving Windows 11’s dark mode. </strong>Nearly a decade after a full dark mode was introduced in Windows 10, the latest preview build of Windows 11 now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760466/microsoft-windows-11-dark-mode-improvements">includes even more darkened UI elements</a>. If you’re copying files or deleting them, these file operation dialogs will finally have a dark mode instead of light-themed prompt. Hopefully this signals that more dark mode improvements are coming with the 25H2 update to Windows 11 later this year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft employee arrested at headquarters while protesting Israel contracts. </strong>Microsoft employee <strong>Anna Hattle</strong>, a software engineer in Microsoft’s cloud and AI team, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763261/microsoft-employee-arrested-headquarters-protest-redmond-police">arrested at the company’s headquarters during protests</a> against Microsoft’s cloud contracts with Israel. Hattle’s arrest was part of 18 arrests by Redmond Police, including former Microsoft employees who joined the protest for a second day. The No Azure for Apartheid group continues to protest Microsoft’s cloud contracts with Israel, calling on the company to cut ties after reports emerged that the Israeli government uses Azure to power a surveillance network of Palestinian phone calls.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft hints at “more affordable” Xbox Cloud Gaming plan</strong>. Microsoft has dropped hints about a potential dedicated Xbox Cloud Gaming plan multiple times before, but it feels like we’re getting closer to an announcement. <strong>Jason Ronald</strong>, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast earlier this week and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint">hinted that Microsoft wants to make its Xbox Cloud</a> “much more affordable” and accessible to players. Microsoft is currently building a next-generation Xbox console and cloud network, so not having to buy Xbox Game Pass Ultimate just for cloud gaming access would certainly be a welcome move.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Excel adds Copilot AI to help fill in spreadsheet cells. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761338/microsoft-excel-ai-copilot-spreadsheet-cell-filling">AI-powered function in Excel</a> that can automatically fill cells in spreadsheets. It’s similar to the feature that Google Sheets rolled out in June, and allows you to call up a “COPILOT” function to generate summaries, create tables, and more.</span></li><li><span><strong><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></strong><strong> is heading to Nintendo Switch 2</strong>. I’ve been patiently waiting for Microsoft’s first Switch 2 game, and at Gamescom this week, the company announced that it’s bringing Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761722/a-new-indy-game-for-switch-2"><em>Indiana Jones</em> to Nintendo’s latest console in 2026</a>. It’s one of the first PC games to require ray tracing, so it’ll be interesting to see what Bethesda does with the Switch 2 port.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11 test brings AI file search to the Copilot app</strong>. Microsoft has started testing the ability to use AI to search through your files and images directly from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762788/windows-11-test-brings-ai-file-search-to-the-copilot-app">Copilot app on Windows 11</a>. The test is rolling out to Windows Insiders on Copilot Plus PCs and allows you to use more descriptive language when conducting your search. Microsoft is also making it easier to jump into “guided help” sessions with Copilot Vision.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Teams is getting a microphone volume indicator</strong>. I can’t be the only person who asks “Can you hear me?” on a Microsoft Teams meeting, but that might be a thing of the past soon. Microsoft is adding a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/Microsoft365InsiderBlog/new-microphone-volume-indicator-in-teams/4442879">volume indicator to Teams</a> on macOS and Windows that makes it easy to see if your microphone is working. This new feature is currently in testing before it rolls out to Teams users in the coming months.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s AI chief wants to “build AI for people, not to be a person</strong>.” Microsoft AI CEO <strong>Mustafa Suleyman</strong> has <a href="https://mustafa-suleyman.ai/seemingly-conscious-ai-is-coming">written a blog post</a> where he shares his concerns about AI models becoming too humanlike to the point where people will believe they are conscious entities. “My central worry is that many people will start to believe in the illusion of AIs as conscious entities so strongly that they’ll soon advocate for AI rights, model welfare and even AI citizenship,” says Suleyman. “This development will be a dangerous turn in AI progress and deserves our immediate attention.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ new Xbox Ally handhelds launch on October 16th. </strong>We finally got a date for the new Xbox Ally handhelds this week: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility">October 16th</a>. Weirdly there was no price or preorders, though. That didn’t stop Best Buy from accidentally listing the Xbox Ally at $549.99 and the Xbox Ally X at $899.99. I do wonder if Asus and Microsoft can subsidize this hardware a little further to bring those price points down, and we’re going to find out if that’s possible in the coming weeks.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox on PC is getting a highlights reel and Auto SR</strong>. Alongside the Xbox Ally release date announcement, Microsoft also revealed this week that it’s bringing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166413/microsoft-windows-auto-super-resolution-sr-qualcomm-npu-dlss-fsr">Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</a>, which uses an NPU to upscale games, to the Xbox Ally X in early 2026. It will be joined by a new highlights reels feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay moments and make them easily shareable with friends or on social networks.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is improving the game shader experience on Windows.</strong> The DirectX team at Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/">new “advanced shader delivery” system</a> that’s designed to preload game shaders during download on the Xbox Ally devices. It’s launching on these handhelds first, to make games launch faster and run a lot smoother without stutters. It’s similar to Valve’s own efforts to improve the shader situation, and Microsoft says it will eventually expand this to more games and more devices over time.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cda3a2b9a8bdaca98db9a5a8bba8bfaaa8e3aea2a0"><span data-cfemail="264849524356474266524e4350435441430845494b">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> if you want to discuss anything else.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release.1277376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally releasing on September 4, 2025. That may be two years after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was originally promised</a> for release, but the news doesn’t come with any less hype surrounding it.</p>



<p>But why did it take so long for Silksong, the sequel to the highly successful Hollow Knight, to release? According to Team Cherry, it’s because they were having too much fun building the game.</p>



<p>In a new feature story from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen spoke about what it was like creating the game, the delays, the pending release, and more.</p>



<p>The lengthy gap between Hollow Knight and Silksong wasn’t the result of any sort of studio struggles. Instead, the project grew far larger than originally planned. What began as a small expansion centered on Hornet evolved into a full-scale sequel with multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world even bigger than the original.</p>



<p>Team Cherry’s small size meant progress naturally took longer, but the developers say the process was consistently joyful. Their creative workflow encouraged them to experiment and add new ideas, which kept expanding the scope of the game.</p>



<p><strong>“We’re very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,</strong>” Gibson told Schreier. “<strong>Not exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that’s very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone’s off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person’s laughed, and that’s enough.</strong>“</p>



<p>Unlike many studios, Team Cherry wasn’t pressured to rush out a release. Hollow Knight’s massive success—over 15 million copies sold—provided financial freedom, allowing them to polish Silksong extensively and ensure the entire game met the same high standard.</p>



<p>After releasing regular updates, the studio went quiet to focus on the game, believing regular updates would only frustrate fans. The end result is the game they wanted to make, even if it took years longer than expected.</p>



<p>Now, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming in September. However, that’s not the end for the game. Both Gibson and Pellen say they already are working on plans for what’s next for the game.</p>



<p><strong>“Launching it is obviously quite exciting,”</strong> Pellen said. <strong>“What comes after for us is equally as exciting.”</strong></p>



<p>In his hands-on preview of the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Andy Highton said</a> that Silksong is “the game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait.”</p>

        <p>In addition, we’ve also announced a <em>King of Meat</em> Technical Test, which will run from August 23 at 6:00 p.m. BST until August 24 at 6:00 p.m. BST on Steam, PlayStation 5, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,769 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a>, giving players around the world the opportunity to get an early look at <em>King of Meat</em>. The participant feedback from the technical test will help us deliver the best possible experience at launch.</p><p>Players can join by searching for either <em>King of Meat</em> on Steam or <em>King of Meat</em> – Technical Test on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Join with your squad or head to our Official Discord channel to grab some friends.</p><p>Hang out with your favorite Creator on Twitch for 30 minutes of cumulative watch time during the Technical Test to claim your Beta Rewards Top.

Twitch Drops can only be claimed once per account.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>With the launch of <em>King of Meat</em> just a few weeks away, our teams at Glowmade and Amazon Games have provided an early overview of our values, player impact, and content strategy for the game.</p><p><strong>Our Values</strong></p><p>As Amazon Games and Glowmade worked together to develop the business model for <em>King of Meat</em>, we identified three core principles that embody our values, serve as our foundation, and guide our decision-making.</p><ul><li><strong>No Pay-to-Win</strong> – All purchases in-game are purely cosmetic with no gameplay impact, and can be earned by playing the game.<br>Choice: All cosmetics are completely optional.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> – There are no loot boxes or any other randomized form of monetization. This means that players always know exactly what they are buying and how much it costs.</li></ul><p><strong>Game Content</strong></p><p>There will be over 100 dungeons available at launch, but that number will quickly grow as the community pushes Create Mode to its limits. Most launch dungeons were meticulously crafted by Glowmade, while some came straight from the next generation of dungeon creators like you. These community-built dungeons were hand-picked from our ongoing playtests.</p><p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p><p><em>King of Meat</em> updates to the base game will be free for all players who’ve bought the game. While we aren’t ready to talk about post-launch support just yet, you can look forward to new game modes, player customisation options, Create Mode tools, regular events, dungeons, and more.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/king-of-meat-launches-october-7-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc-in-early-2026-for-switch]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Forza Horizon 6 hasn't even been officially announced by Microsoft, and yet, a possible leak might have revealed the racing game's setting: Japan. An Australian car import company reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/a/s8U6ckB" rel="nofollow ">posted and then deleted an image</a> on Instagram that showed a developer scanning Japanese kei cars.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://cultandclassic.com.au/" rel="nofollow ">Cult and Classic</a> post was spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" rel="nofollow ">the subreddit Gaming Leaks and Rumours</a>, with Forza Horizon fans extrapolating that the Japanese kei cars (which aren't found in America) strongly hint at Japan for the game's setting. However, there are a couple of reasons this theory could be misguided. For instance, Forza Horizon developer Playground Games is based in the United Kingdom, so cars not being available in the US has no bearing on scanning for the team. Additionally, why wouldn't the dev member just fly out to Japan instead of Australia to scan a kei car, which roughly translates to light vehicle?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s whopping open beta has now come and gone, and Battlefield Studios is addressing the feedback it has received, chiefly as it pertains to the game's bigger maps and criticism of player counts across its modes.</p><p>One of the main concerns for players coming out of the beta was the status of Battlefield 6's larger maps. The biggest one in the beta, Liberation Peak, was popular enough with players who craved the classic large-scale warfare of the series--even if it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">far too many snipers</a>--but many were left wanting more. This feeling was only exacerbated by the beta's apparent focus on smaller maps and modes, like Breakthrough and Rush on infantry-focused arenas like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and eventually, Empire State.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> to players starved for bigger maps, which have already been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/much-larger-battlefield-6-maps-revealed-in-datamine-including-new-vehicles/1100-6534039/" data-ref-id="1100-6534039">revealed by dataminers</a>, Battlefield Studios has assured the community that "larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package," and they're on the way. The post elaborates that two of the game's significantly larger maps, one set in Mirak Valley and the other a remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm, will be included in the next phase of Battlefield Labs testing, which is set to continue leading up to Battlefield 6's launch on October 10.</p><p>Fans of Battlefield have come to expect certain things of the games, and one of those core tenets is greater player counts than the average multiplayer FPS title. However, a great deal of these players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">let down</a> when the fan-favorite mode Rush was introduced in the second weekend of the beta with a significantly smaller lobby size than usual, supporting up to 24 players in tight 12v12 matches.</p><p>Rush typically tasks teams with defending and attacking pairs of bomb sites at a time and has supported bigger lobbies in past games, which is what has wrinkled fans of the mode about its implementation in the latest game. It and the 64-player Conquest modes are often looked to as the signature modes of the Battlefield series and emblematic of its emphasis on big battles, so any significant change to it was bound to cause a stir. Battlefield Studios hears the concern from players, but also thinks that this downsizing might be the best move for Rush right now, and that it is in line with what it calls "the golden era" of the mode.</p><p>The team shared, "When it comes to Rush, the conversation we observed wasn't just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer. Rush is a mode with deep roots, originally known as Gold Rush in [Battlefield] Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. Many of you remember this as the golden era of Rush, and it continues to inspire our approach today."</p><p>It then goes on to say that despite toying with bigger lobby sizes in the past, these inflated player counts often led to issues that are streamlined or eliminated outright by cutting back and emphasizing smaller-team tactics. Due to that, the team is sticking with its lowered default player count for Rush, but encourages players wanting large-scale Rush to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-portal-mode-is-the-answer-to-people-not-wanting-a-game-they-can-complete/1100-6533700/" data-ref-id="1100-6533700">Portal</a>, Battlefield's custom matchmaking and level-building mode.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post goes into more detail about overall beta numbers. As folks may have gathered from the queues, livestreams, videos, and posts on social media, Battlefield 6's open beta was a knockout for EA. According to a graphic released by the team, there were roughly 420 million matches played over the course of the two beta weekends, totaling about 92 million hours of play. Players racked up more than 4.9 billion kills, knocked nearly 4 million jets out of the sky (I was at least half a dozen of those), and did 196 billion dollars in property damage.</p><p>Battlefield 6 releases on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Digital Eclipse has revealed the full roster of games for its retrospective compilation/interactive documentary, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection. This update reveals that the infamously terrible single-player spin-off titles Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces will be part of the bundle.</p><p>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero launched for the original PlayStation in 1997 and is a side-scrolling action game starring the titular ice ninja (specifically Bi-Han, the first Sub-Zero and eventual Noob Saibot). Spoiler: It’s a very bad game, but it is notable for featuring the series debuts for staple fighters Quan Chi and Shinnok. You can watch former GI editors (including <em>Giant Bomb'</em>s Dan Ryckert) suffer through this game in this classic 2010 episode of Replay, posted below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wFljLP_1-4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wFljLP_1-4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces was released in 2000, also for PlayStation 1, and is a 3D action game starring Jax. The game sees him taking on Kano and his crew of baddies, including the debuting Tremor, who would later resurface as a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/07/19/see-mortal-kombat-x-39-s-next-dlc-character-tremor-crush-opponents-with-rocks.aspx">DLC fighter in Mortal Kombat X</a>. Special Forces didn’t exactly light the world on fire; that’s a nice way of saying it’s also terrible. It does have a very funny and strange <a href="https://youtu.be/8T1EeAHIFMU?si=kn0qWzQKEWURaO4H">‘70s spy-themed intro cinematic</a> going for it, though.</p><p>Digital Eclipse also announced that the extremely rare WaveNet Arcade version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is part of the Kollection. This version was originally made to support Midway’s WaveNet online matchmaking service for arcades, and has not been available on any platform since 1997. It’s also the only arcade release to feature Noob Saibot as a playable fighter.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Kollection's new trailer from Gamescom below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Here is the full list of titles in the Kollection:</p><ul><li><strong>Mortal Kombat</strong> – 1992 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat II</strong> – 1993 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat 3</strong> – 1995 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis)</li><li><strong>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</strong> – 1995 (Arcade, WaveNet Arcade, SNES)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</strong> – 1996 (PlayStation)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat 4</strong> – 1997 (Arcade)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</strong> – 1997 (PlayStation)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Special Forces</strong> – 2000 (PlayStation)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Advance</strong> – 2001 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</strong> – 2002 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</strong> – 2003 (Game Boy Advance)</li></ul><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection launches later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-full-roster-includes-mythologies-sub-zero-and-special]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> got a trailer and release date today, meaning huge swathes of the internet are now going to need to find a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126470/hollow-knight-silksong-meme-release-date-triple-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme</a>. What took so long? Developer Team Cherry was just making a video game.</p><p>According to a story by Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the big mystery of what’s been up with <em>Silksong</em> since its announcement in 2019 was just studio co-founders William Pellen and Ari Gibson taking their time making their video game. “It’s just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it,” Gibson said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>According to the developers, <em>Silksong</em>, initially meant to be an expansion, grew big enough to be a full game, and then the team kept adding new ideas. According to Gibson, the studio eventually went radio silent because “[w]e felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,” Pellen said.</p><p>Sounds right! The studio told Bloomberg they did believe the game would be out sooner, and that, according to Gibson “we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things.” But Gibson also said that, rather than being stressful, the actual <em>development</em> part of developing a game was fun, so the studio wanted to keep doing it. He said, “[I]t’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”</p><p>My two favorite parts of this story are that the team doesn’t use Jira, a project management software ubiquitous in games and tech (they briefly had Trello, but their account got deactivated because they didn’t use it enough) and that they were mostly ignorant of the online drama around the game. According to Bloomberg, “They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.” Pellen told Bloomberg that it “[f]eels like we’re going to ruin [fans’] fun by releasing the game.”</p><p>My second favorite part is that after the hints about the game during a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/23160254/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June Xbox showcase</a> and a tease during Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnH9UcLZpbM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night</a>, neither Microsoft nor Geoff Keighley got the big trailer and release date everyone has spent years thirsting for. Team Cherry just put it all up on their YouTube page at what was for me on the East Coast a totally normal time (though after maybe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3lww5sv6s722u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit too much countdown</a>). In an industry defined by hype and desperately trying to force the big moments of the past into a space they <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no longer fit in</a>, one of the most hotly-anticipated games said “no” to all that and just did its own thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t go so far as to call this some wider lesson for all game developers; as Bloomberg points out, it certainly helps that the original <em>Hollow Knight </em>made enough money to support a small team taking as long as it wanted to make not just a game, but a sequel to a wildly popular one that people are still playing. And however much the developers claim they didn’t pay attention to the hype and anticipation, the wait and its silence certainly generated buzz that kept both the original (Bloomberg writes that <em>Hollow Knight</em> has sold an additional 12 million copies since <em>Silksong</em>’s 2019 announcement) and <em>Silksong</em> in people’s consciousness, and which it seems reasonable to imagine will have an effect on <em>Silksong</em>’s ultimate sales.&nbsp;</p><p>And I don’t think this is some look-in-the-mirror moment for the folks who spammed “Silksong” at every showcase since 2019 either. As the devs themselves acknowledged, what Gibson called the “strange or very exciting communities” that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jubilation-chaos-and-a-lot-of-screaming-inside-the-hollow-knight-community-discord-as-the-silksong-release-date-finally-hit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formed around <em>not</em> seeing <em>Silksong</em></a><em> </em>were fun in their own right, and certainly gave folks something to rally around as we sat through events over the years. Since this is the internet, I’m sure there were some toxic corners earnestly angered over the wait, and plenty of editors demanding <em>Silksong</em> prewrites tailored to whatever the Google search requirements of the moment were. But from where I sat, <em>Silksong</em> was a funny joke my friends made that offset the dread of covering another showcase for work, a low stakes space to play with anticipation and disappointment in a field that often makes too much out of them.</p><p>Of course, that’s all over now: I’m already seeing journalist peers fishing for homes for reviews, worrying over how long they’ll have between code and embargo <strong>(Update, 12:55pm--</strong>According to Schreier, Team Cherry <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't plan to send out early code</a><strong>)</strong>, and stressing about how many other games are releasing near <em>Silksong</em>’s September 4 release date. But, at least for a little while, some fans got to have their jokes, and some developers got to make their video game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release]]></content:encoded>

It's <strong>4th September</strong>, if you missed it, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier has sat down with the devs to find out why it has taken so long to make.</p>
<p>The short answer, as detailed in Schreier's feature (paywalled), is that the team has simply been having a nice time making it. The ideas kept piling up, and a pesky little global pandemic pushed things back somewhat, but it sounds like Team Cherry has been maintaining a healthy attitude to the whole thing for the past seven years — which, in the grand scheme of high-profile development stories, is rather lovely to hear.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vtknwg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Despite spending this much time with the massively-hyped sequel, it seems that Team Cherry already has ideas for <em>more</em> content to add to the game. "Launching it is obviously quite exciting," the studio's co-founder William Pellen told Bloomberg, “What comes after for us is equally as exciting”.</p>
<p>"The most interesting thing now is what we can add to it next," Team Cherry's other co-founder, Ari Gibson, agreed, even teasing that the team has "got a plan" for what these additions might look like. "Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well," Gibson continued, "but hopefully we can achieve some of it”.</p>

<p>And it sounds like the team could have kept going for many more years than the six it's been since Silksong was announced. "It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping," Pellen commented, "We could have kept going”. Gibson even stated that he "had to stop sketching" at some point, to avoid a situation where that game takes "15 years to finish". Heh, it makes six years of waiting sound like child's play, no?</p>
<p>The devs also shared with Bloomberg why their updates have been so few and far between in recent years, with Gibson stating that “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing, because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it’”. Pellen sang to the same tune, affirming, “Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game” — not that they expected things to take this long, of course.</p>

<p>There are just two weeks to go now until we all finally get our hands on Hollow Knight: Silksong, and based on our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/video-at-last-weve-played-hollow-knight-silksong-on-switch-2">Gamescom hands-on preview</a>, it's looking extremely promising.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-interactive-entertainment-sells-its-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming-sie-to-sponsor-the-event-through-2028.1277316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has sold its ownership stake in the fighting tournament EVO to NODWIN Gaming, a company that's also backed by the Sony Group Corporation, but owned by Nazara Technologies. SIE will continue to sponsor the event globally through to 2028, while NODWIN Gaming will take over co-ownership duties alongside RTS.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2025-business-update">"<em>Business Update</em>"</a> blog post on the official EVO website, where the Evolution Championship Series called the change "<em>a major step forward"</em> for the tournament. </p>



<p>On the transition, SIE senior vice president and head of global partner development and relations, Phil Rosenberg, said, "<em>When SIE acquired Evo alongside RTS in 2021, our goal was to help the Evo community grow and spotlight the skills and passion of fighting game fans on a global stage</em>. <em>As SIE transitions to become an Evo sponsor, the momentum for Evo has never been stronger, following a successful Las Vegas event and upcoming expansion to new regions. We look forward to supporting the continued growth of Evo globally."</em></p>



<p>For NODWIN Gaming's part, co-founder and managing director Akshat Rathee added, "<em>Evo was built by a team whose authenticity and passion for the fighting game community are unmatched</em>. <em>We will continue SIE’s great work and honor the legacy of everyone who has made it what it is today, while opening the door for a new generation to experience the spirit of Evo</em>."</p>



<p>Today's update also included the introduction of a new partner, Qiddiya, which is now a global partner of the tournament and an investor in its co-owner, RTS.</p>



<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment is no longer a part owner of the tournament, as a global sponsor we can still expect to see SIE and PlayStation use the tournament to showcase upcoming products like the recently unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a> fight stick and playable demos of upcoming fighting games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls,</a> which attendees at this year's show had the chance to try. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is almost over, with Team Cherry announcing today that the game will finally release on September 4, 2025, over six years after it was first announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it sounds like Hollow Knight lovers won't be done obsessing over Silksong news even then, because Team Cherry is apparently working on even more Silksong content for months, or even years down the road.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg interview</a> with Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen, which ends with the pair confirming they're already planning extra content for Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Launching it is obviously quite exciting,” Pellen said. “What comes after for us is equally as exciting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,” Gibson added. “We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not shocking the pair have more they want to add to Silksong. The game originally started out as DLC for Hollow Knight, but grew and evolved as the team fleshed the idea out more and more. And Silksong kept growing throughout its development, with both developers saying they simply had so much fun continuing to add things that excited them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,” Pellen said. “That stuff’s so nice. It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have kept going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” Gibson said. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pair tell Bloomberg that their enjoyment of the development process and desire to keep adding more fun things was the entire reason development took so long. Gibson says the game was "never stuck", but they are a small team, and games take time. "There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, despite the community's zeal around Silksong and the memes, obsession, and fanaticism around its eventual release, neither Gibson nor Pellen really paid much attention. They say they tried to stay quiet throughout development both to avoid spoiling the community, and to focus on development first. But then, development took a lot longer than they originally thought it would. Still, they didn't really read either Reddit or YouTube comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they’ve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,” Gibson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Feels like we’re going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,” Pellen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
