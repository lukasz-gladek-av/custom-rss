			<p>Considering just how fundamental Tetris is to gaming history, it’s perhaps a little surprising that it isn’t featured more often in the merry-go-round of genre mashups that we so often see. Drop Duchy takes those iconic tetrominos and transforms them into land tiles, blending the block-dropping puzzle with deck building, roguelite progression and a theme that would feel fitting for a physical board game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drop Duchy - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-1bVOl6iio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The lands are under threat and/or tyranny from belligerent armies and cruel overlords, and only you can build up your duchy piece by piece to defeat them. Presented with an 8×13 grid, you drop tiles in those oh-so-familiar shapes into place until you either run out of blocks or breach the top of the grid. Unlike Tetris, completing a row doesn’t vanish it from view, but instead rewards you with resources for each of the tiles it contains, adding permanence to every decision you make.</p>


<p>Mixed in with the standard land tiles are buildings of several types. Production buildings will draw resources from their surroundings, often transforming the land at the same time – a farm will turn plains into wheat fields, there’s forestry buildings that can clear woodland or draw upon it, mining tiles, and more. But then there’s the military buildings for both yourself and, in a combat round, for your enemies, and they will also have various conditions and modifiers to determine how many troops they supply. A watchtower needs to be near plains and fields to supply you with archers, a siege camp can reduce the units on nearby enemy buildings, the alarm tower recruits when aligned vertically or horizontally with enemy buildings, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s only very minimal time pressure applied to you during this. Yes, blocks left alone will slowly start to drop, but you have so much time to consider your plans and look at the next three tiles coming to decide what to do. Additionally, you can put a block in reserve (which can effectively remove an enemy tile from the action, if you hold it to the end of the round), and swapping in and out of reserve resets the block to the top of the grid, so again, you’ve got acres of time to make your mind up.</p>


<p>At the end of a round with enemies is the combat phase, adding yet another layer to the puzzling. You connect up all of the military units, simplistically adding allied units together and subtracting enemies, but the order in which you do these is important. Units recruited are either light (sword), heavy (axe) or ranged (arrows), and there’s a typical triangle of strengths and weaknesses between them, giving a 1.5x multiplier so that 12 archers can take out 18 axes, for example. Merging units together unites them all as one unit type, determined by whichever had the higher number. Once again, you can play this out in so many different ways, toying with the multipliers and how stacks are added together.</p>
<p>If you come out the other side with enemies left over, that number is chipped away from your duchy’s health stat, so a “loss” isn’t necessarily the end of a run.</p>
<p>Each area builds up to a boss battle, the first of which constrains you within a subsection of the grid while having a large health count for you to defeat. The second and third then start to put even more strictures on your placement, at the penalty of bolstering the enemy forces, and they all make for a refreshing change of pace. However, there’s only three of these bosses, and while they can force your hand into disadvantageous block placement, they’re easy to defeat on a good run.</p>
<p>You chart your own path through the overworld, heading down different branches to decide what to tackle next. You can often choose between rounds that have combat and that are peaceful –&nbsp;though this boosts the impending boss battle –&nbsp;and you’re also shown the split between terrain types which could advantage your deck at that time. You also have resource spots to dole out lump sums, trading posts and more.</p>

<p>Even in your first few runs, there’s so many variable that emerge as you go from round to round. Each round rewards you with a choice of three building cards, and you can then spend resources to level them up and increase their efficacy and range –&nbsp;a level 3 farm is something to behold and incredibly empowering to a level 3 watchtower that it envelops in fields.</p>
<p>However, you’ll start to complete tasks and missions (like recruiting a certain number with a particular military building) for the overarching progression, unlocking new buildings, river terrain and buildings, new technology cards that act as passive modifiers, and eventually two more factions that play very differently to the starting one. Shifting from being able to quite purely focus on military buildings to needing to build a town around a belfry changes the tone and how you tackle the puzzle.</p>
<p>There’s also increasing difficulty levels and modifiers to put further restrictions on you, like not being able to huddle enemy buildings together or their power is amplified, or having a smaller grid to play on. You do have that compulsive feel of wanting to play another run in Drop Duchy, and these added challenges will give more to those that want them, but at the same time, I’m fairly content after half a dozen successful runs and seeing what each faction has to offer.</p>

			<p>The latest PC games to receive support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are MechWarrior 5: Clans, New World: Aeternum, and Spirit of the North 2.</p>
<p>MechWarrior 5: Clans is the Unreal Engine 5-powered single-player and co-op campaign focused spin-off of MechWarrior 5. The game launched in October 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-in-mechwarrior-5-clans-a-quiet-place-road-ahead-and-forgive-me-father-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>; tomorrow, with the debut of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463200/MechWarrior_5_Clans__Ghost_Bear_Flash_Storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Bear: Flash Storm story-based DLC</a>, Clans will be updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, enabling much faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. Moreover, the NVIDIA app override functionality will be updated to allow users to manually upgrade the existing NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution CNN model to the newest transformer one for improved image quality.</p>
<p>In exactly a week from today, Amazon Games will launch Season 8 - Season of the Divide for its MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>. The new Season will introduce the new Outpost Rush map Coral Divide, Capture The Flag maps, a new 3v3 Arena map, seasonal events, limited-time world events featuring iconic bosses from the dungeons, the barbershop, and several combat updates included tuned aim assist for controller users. New World: Aeternum will also now default to using DirectX 12 on Steam, and the developers have improved visuals and performance on NVIDIA GPUs thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>In two days, the third-person adventure sequel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778840/Spirit_of_the_North_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirit of the North 2</a> will let players once again wander in a mysterious world as a lonely fox. This game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation from day one.</p>
<p>There are also PC games that still adopt just the regular NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution. For example, the realistic multiplayer first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406770/Bodycam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodycam</a> was recently updated to support DLSS SR, and Frame Generation will be added soon. Bossa's cooperative open world survival game adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-upcoming-lost-skies-officially-due-to-arrive-in-early-access-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Skies,</a> recently launched on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution integration.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling action RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> also featured NVIDIA DLSS SR support when it launched on Steam, and the same goes for the first-person horror adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019760/Necrophosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necrophosis</a>. The latter game also offers a demo to check out ahead of the purchase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hordes-of-hunger-early-access-hands-on-just-one-more-wave/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Among the many high games I checked out during Gamescom last year was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hordes-of-hunger-hands-on-preview-monster-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hordes of Hunger</a>, a unique blend of mechanics lifted from Vampire Survivors, Hades, and hack-and-slash games. Though my test session was short, I was immediately captivated by the smoothness of the gameplay and the character-building possibilities the game seemed to offer right from the beginning. Though it seemed to lack a bit of polish compared to other similar games, I felt the game had a ton of potential with its relatively straightforward formula almost reminiscent of an arcade game that made it very easy to get into.</p>
<p>Following the release of a demo version that was generally very well-received, Hordes of Hunger is now available as an Early Access release on Steam. After spending a dozen or so hours with the very first public release of the game, I can only say that my expectations after trying the game for the first time last year were almost completely met.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250428121356_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The <em>"3D action survivorlike" </em>developed by Hyperstrange doesn't waste any time getting the player into the thick of the action. After starting the game, main character Mirah awakens in the Sanctum, the only safe haven for humanity after the Beast and its ravenous hordes have stripped the land bare, ready to take on these hordes and save the world. Much like in the aforementioned Hades, the story develops as Mirah completes quests set in several different locations and rescues other central characters that will also offer additional services to help the warrior overcome even more challenging enemies. These services are generally standard fare for the genre, such as purchasing permanent perks from the Father, buffing meals from the Mother, or crafting new weapons at the Workshop, and they are extremely easy to understand and take full advantage of.</p>
<p>This simplicity works quite well in the context of Hordes of Hunger, as the game wants the player to constantly be out and about to fight the hordes of the Beast, hordes whose strength changes depending on the location and how many quests have already been completed in it. For example, the Main Square will be the starting point for all players, as it features the easiest enemies, while the Watermill and the Forest feature from the very first Horde Extermination quest some advanced enemy types that require players to be at the very least familiar with the different weapon types, which range from the basic all-rounder sword to the hard hitting hammer and the mobile spear, their heavy attacks, which require Focus built by fighting enemies, special attacks and the general use of the skills learned as Mirah levels up during quests.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250428120718_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted last year, the skill system, along with the smooth, fast-paced, satisfying gameplay, is the feature that best defines Hordes of Hunger. The first public version of the game features a nice selection of skills that range from simple stat buffs to unique abilities like auras that deal elemental damage, additional attacks with phantom weapons, dodge and parry enhancements and so on that can not only be enhanced multiple times, but that also synergize well, and unexpectedly in some cases. As Miriah levels up reasonably quickly, and can do so even faster by acquiring certain perks, it doesn't take too long for the warrior to get powered up and see all sorts of special elemental effects go off at once, which, to be honest, tends to be a little distracting and often makes it difficult to understand what is going on amidst all the chaos. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues found in Hordes of Hunger in its first Early Access release, alongside the unpolished and somewhat clunky menus that don't feel designed for controllers, especially the weapon crafting interface, where it is difficult to see which element is highlighted.</p>
<p>With so many combat options at the player's disposal right from the get-go, varied quests that range from simple extermination of enemies to simple escort and target destruction quests, and the promise of bigger things to come down the line, Hordes of Hunger is a well worth purchase even in its current state for players looking for a game that is highly addictive, feels great to play and doesn't require tens of hours to get going. While the experience could become a little repetitive after a few hours, its solid direction is remarkable, and I hope developer Hyperstrange will continue to spice up the experience ahead of its 1.0 release, which has yet to be dated.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backbone-announces-backbone-pro-controller-for-any-screen.1181937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mobile controller company Backbone has announced the Backbone Pro, a new controller whose stated aim is to let you play on "any screen with a single device".</p>

<p>The controller, which is out now via Backbone's website, is designed for a world in which "more people are playing across platforms than ever before", the company says. It's got two principal modes: Handheld and Wireless.</p>

<p>In Handheld mode, you'll connect the controller to a mobile device via USB-C for "zero latency and no need to charge", while in Wireless mode, the Backbone Pro will connect via Bluetooth. It'll work with devices like phones, tablets, laptops and PCs (with Bluetooth functionality), and VR headsets, as well as smart TVs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-fortnite.jpg?itok=0brwFsvY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-fortnite.jpg?itok=8xRVsaiM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Backbone Pro wants to let you game anywhere with just one controller.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but the controller will come complete with an app that lets you change remembered devices with a single tap, allowing you to switch seamlessly between gaming platforms.</p>

<p>Backbone says it had to "rethink everything" to make the Pro work, "from industrial design to firmware". The company goes on to say that the controller constitutes "one of the most comfortable handheld gaming products ever built".</p>

<p>According to Backbone, the Pro will feature full-size console-style joysticks, and you can remap every single button on the controller, including its back paddles. You can also create specific game profiles and switch between them within the Backbone app.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely, the Backbone Pro also comes with its own "built-in emulator" that will feature a "rotating library of free games" if you sign up to the Backbone Plus subscription service. Backbone doesn't reveal what those games are, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=-t-Vh122 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=4uCMBzl0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A retro emulator is included with the Backbone Pro, although we don't know what games will come with it yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since there's a USB-C port on the Backbone Pro, you can also hook it up to your PC for some good old-fashioned wired gaming. Naturally, though, the controller won't work as an Xbox or PlayStation peripheral, nor can you hook it up to your Switch or Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Backbone Pro is available right now via Backbone's website.</p>

That process included dozens of user studies and thousands of component iterations geared toward finding the most comfortable controller for as many players as possible. Ergonomics are subjective, but the difference between the Backbone Pro and Backbone One is immediately noticeable. The Pro model is by no means bulky, but the more rounded, chunkier handles feel more natural.</p><p>The redesign is especially beneficial for longer play sessions. If you, like me, find the Backbone One to be somewhat uncomfortable when playing for longer than 30 minutes to an hour, the Pro's form factor is much friendlier in this regard. It caters better to those with larger hands without sacrificing the compact design that many people love. My four-year-old son tested the Backbone Pro with several Apple Arcade games without any issues with the larger size.</p><p>When I picked up the Backbone Pro for the first time, my ring fingers rested naturally on the M1 and M2 back buttons. Depending on your hand size and how you hold the controller, it might be more natural for you to use your middle fingers instead. Back buttons are no longer novel features like they once were, but it's a meaningful addition nonetheless.</p><p>The presence of back buttons spurred a substantial improvement within the Backbone App. If you want to remap your controls on the Backbone One on iPhone, you have to exit the app and use Apple's dedicated game controller settings menu. On Android, the only official option is Backbone's TouchSync feature, which is restricted to Backbone+ subscribers. Thankfully, the Backbone Pro supports input customization within the official app. You can quickly set up as many custom profiles as you want, remap buttons, adjust trigger and stick sensitivity, and create deadzones for both.</p><p>Speaking of the sticks and triggers, it's worth reiterating that while the Backbone Pro has Hall Effect triggers, it does <em>not </em>have Hall Effect sticks. The Backbone Pro's full-sized sticks are certainly nicer than the shorter ones found in the original. They offer a smooth range of motion and feel precise, but these are still ALPS sticks. Though ALPS remains the most widely used analog stick technology--Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony all use it in their controllers--ALPS sticks are susceptible to drifting issues. The anti-friction thumbstick ring should act as an extra layer of protection, but it's still disappointing that a $170 pro-style controller doesn't have Hall Effect sticks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488226" data-ratio="0.456" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488226"></a><figcaption>Remapping buttons in the Backbone App</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png"></figure><p>Like the original, the Backbone Pro's greatest asset is its ability to turn your phone into a Switch-like gaming handheld. The ability to use the Backbone Pro as a wireless controller for other devices via Bluetooth is an interesting bonus. I tested the Backbone Pro on my PC, MacBook, iPad, Steam Deck, and Meta Quest 3S. From a pure performance perspective, the Backbone Pro works well as a wireless controller. The app remembers your devices, and you can swap between them almost instantly. Customization and game-specific profile support could make using the controller as a traditional gamepad enticing for some. As an Apple Arcade subscriber, it's neat to have control profiles that can be used for the same game across iPhone, iPad, and Mac</p><p>If you already have a pro-style wireless controller for PC and mobile, the Backbone Pro probably won't replace that. Without a phone attached, it feels a bit too light as a standalone wireless controller. Plus, if you're like me, you might have a hard time getting past the visual aesthetic of the Backbone Pro without a phone between each half.</p><p>At $170, the Backbone Pro is one of the most expensive dedicated mobile controllers around. It's $70 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One ($100)</a> and $20 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi Ultra</a>, a high-end mobile controller that released last year. For Android users, it sounds even more expensive when you consider that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> costs $50 and is equipped with Hall Effect sticks/triggers and back buttons. But Backbone's mobile gaming experience remains unmatched thanks to the Backbone App, and the Pro takes notable strides forward in software utilization.</p><p>If you use your Backbone One at least a few times each week, you will likely appreciate the Pro's upgrades. And if you've avoided the Backbone One purely because you thought it was too small, you should give the new Pro model a look.</p><p>Existing Backbone users can also take advantage of one of the most exciting new features in the Backbone App: a built-in emulator on iOS and Android for NES, SNES, and Game Boy games (GB, GBC, and GBA). It's currently in beta, but I tested homebrew games for each platform and found the experience to be as smooth as other retro emulators on iOS.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488234" data-ratio="0.461" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488234"></a><figcaption>Backbone Emulator plays NES, Super Nintendo, and Game Boy ROMs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png"></figure><hr><p><em>Backbone provided GameSpot with a pre-launch sample for testing.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ecco-dolphin-remasters-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>creator Ed Annunziata has revealed that remasters of the first two games in the series are on the way, and that a brand new entry in the franchise is also in the works.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> as part of Xbox's Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Annunziata says that remasters of&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>and its 1994 followup&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: The Tides of Time&nbsp;</em>are on the cards, although it's not clear whether work on said remasters has begun yet.</p>

<p>He then says a "new, third game" that features "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" will be made, although it's not clear whether he means a third modern project or a third&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=mKGlFMeC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=P3-AdhKD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At time of writing, this is what you see if you visit the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>website.</figcaption></figure><p>If it's the latter, then Annunziata is perhaps unfairly skipping over 1995's&nbsp;<em>Ecco Jr.</em>, its rather odd Sega Pico-only sequel, and 2000's Dreamcast game&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</em>, which was due to get its own sequel before the Dreamcast's demise.</p>

<p>Either way, Annunziata says interested fans should keep an eye on the official&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>. At time of writing, said website shows only a counter that seems to promise some kind of announcement or reveal at the end of April next year, counting down around 8,500 hours to do so.</p>

<p>In the interview, Annunziata says he believes that "gamers possess a higher than average IQ" when compared to "the average human". This he puts down to gamers' "socially connected" nature, as well as the fact (as he says) that they're "frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival will surely bring at least a modicum of joy to those who were hoping that&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-reveals-new-game-from-ecco-dolphin-team" rel="nofollow">spiritual successor</a> originally touted for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaked-intellivision-amico-documents-paint-grim-picture" rel="nofollow">ill-fated</a> Intellivision Amico, would come to fruition. There's a much better chance of&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>happening than&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=W_vhp-6T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=L9yoNdqR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dolphin Quest&nbsp;</em>probably isn't happening, is it?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many classic IPs Sega is currently in the process of reviving. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Virtua Fighter</em></a>, ninja platformer series&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and wacky arcade racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow"><em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's likely we'll get to hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival in the coming months, although it's not clear whether the above timer is counting down to a release or just a reveal. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and [graphics] sensibilities. Stay tuned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, of course, already a "third" game. As the last mainline Ecco instalment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</u></a> was released on Dreamcast 25 years ago in 2000. However, creator Annunziata wasn't involved. A further sequel, Ecco 2: Sentinels of the Universe, which had been written as a direct sequel to Defender of the Future, was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just want to finally be able to enter my secret password from the end of Tides of Time.

Ecco Jr. and Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt were released in 1995, although they were "edutainment" games and primarily developed as learning tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin sees you play as the titular dolphin, as your underwater world has been devastated by a swirling gust of air and water. You must help him navigate back through treacherous tropical reefs and freezing polar ice floes to reunite him with his dolphin pod. We thought the 2000 remake was okay, writing: "Ecco the Dolphin is a classic from SEGA. But sometimes classics should stay in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For those who have played Ecco before, there's really no reason to come back to it," we wrote of the 2007 remake in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/17/ecco-the-dolphin-review"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin review</u></a>. "There are no extras offered and the Achievements are junk. If you've never played Ecco, then you may want to give it a go. It really is one of the more innovative titles of its time. But, again, that time has long passed, and Ecco's gameplay doesn't stand the test of time like Sonic's."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Ecco the Dolphin game fared much better, getting a 7.6 score in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future review</u></a>, saying: "If you thought Flipper had personality, wait until you get a load of Ecco the Dolphin.

this content!</p></div><p>During the day, players have a number of options for how they want to prepare for the fights ahead--they can take on enemies to level up, search for powerful loot and weapons, infiltrate enemy strongholds in search of information, or challenge more dangerous enemies and dungeon-like lairs to unlock unique items. In all of this, players can choose to travel together, or split up and try to cover more ground. Throughout the day, players may encounter random events or be interrupted by unexpected enemies.</p><p>When night falls, the focus shifts to survival--an ever-contracting ring of fire pushes the player-characters towards a boss fight, which on the final night will be the challenging Nightlord. Whether players triumph against the Nightlord or fall short, they will be able to return to the hub world, the Roundtable Hold, with relics and currency to upgrade and equip their character for the next run.</p><p>Players can pick from one of eight classes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">four of which</a> were available to try in the Nightreign network test--Guardian, Duchess, Recluse, and Wylder. The gameplay overview goes into more detail about two more classes--a ranged archer known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Ironeye</a>, and a heavy-hitting melee fighter called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-character-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465900/" data-ref-id="2300-6465900">Raider</a>. Two more Nightfarers are shown in the trailer, but are not detailed. The Executor's name is briefly revealed in a clip of the character selection screen, but not much else has been revealed about the katana-wielding warrior. The final Nightfarer is shown to be a pale woman with a harp, but not much is known about this final character, including her abilities or even her name.</p><p>Players will be able to customize their Nightfarers to a degree with skins--including some based on other From Software games, with Faraam, Solaire, and Leonhard-inspired skins shown off in the gameplay video. There will also be a narrative aspect to the Nightfarer, with players undertaking a journey to recover their characters' lost memories.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign releases on May 30 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that JRPG-inspired adventure&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone less than two weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached two million sales since its launch in late April. The figure means the game has picked up another million and a half sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">very quickly hitting 500,000</a>&nbsp;on launch day.</p>

<p>Sandfall says it's "watched in awe" as players flocked to&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, "feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation" alongside those playing through the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>-style RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=USkaGTri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=83SgQxfC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the two million figure is particularly impressive when considering that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is also available on Game Pass (as part of the PC and Ultimate tiers, at least), so two million people have bought it rather than opting to play it via the subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series, and it's also a pretty strong argument against&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assertions</a> that gamers don't want turn-based games anymore.</p>

<p>The game follows the titular Expedition 33 as it sets out to put an end to the Paintress, a solemn and terrifying figure who paints increasingly low numbers each year, with everyone of the equivalent age perishing as she paints.</p>

<p>It features staples of the JRPG genre like an overworld map with plenty of optional locations to explore, party members that can be swapped out on the fly, and turn-based battles (albeit with real-time elements and a parry system).</p>

			<p>The price of video games started rising in 2020, but even if that didn't happen five years ago, a price increase would have happened sooner or later for a few reasons, according to former PlayStation president Shuhei Yoshida.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida-san was asked about the increase in video game prices, which may become more normalized with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. According to the former PlayStation president, this price increase would have happened sooner or later, regardless of who would have been the initiator. Inflation is real and significant, Yoshida-san continued, and the fact that players expect ever more ambitious games with rising production costs is a combination that can only increase the price of games.</p>
<p>To keep production costs under control and continue producing the AAA games the public buys, Shuhei Yoshida added, industry actors are keen to diversify their revenues. This is the reason behind the proliferation of remasters, remakes, and PC ports, as they are an easy solution to bring in profits to finance new games. Subscription services and GAAS titles also help finance AAA games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the former PlayStation president feels that a balance between production costs and game prices must be found. GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but the recent Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 has shown that it is possible to release an excellent game with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality.</p>
<p>It isn't just Nintendo that is increasing the price of its games in the near future, but also Microsoft. While the publisher did not increase game prices when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S generation began, some of its games will be priced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">$80 starting this holiday season</a>. The price of the Xbox Series X has also been increased worldwide, with the steepest increase in the United States.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For all the hate Ubisoft gets for its formulaic games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 fans should definitely thank the French publisher, as director Guillame Broche started working on the project because he was bored with his job at the publisher.</p>
<p>Speaking in a recent interview with the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j5gd71ro.amp"> BBC</a>, the director of the popular role-playing game released late last month revealed that the idea for the game came while he was working at Ubisoft. Bored at his job, he wanted to do something different and eventually left the publisher to bring his ideas inspired by his favorite childhood series, Final Fantasy, to life.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is to learn how people were recruited to develop Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Jennifer Svedberg-Yen initially replied to a Reddit message from the game's director looking for voice actors to record something for a free demo. Originally cast as one of the main characters, Jennifer Svedgerb-Yen became the game's main writer. Similarly, composer Lorien Testard, who had never worked on a video game before, was discovered on SoundCloud. While this was generally attributed to a <em>"Guillaume effect"</em> by the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 writer, the director more modestly admitted that his success rate was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and people looking for a creative outlet at the time and massive luck, although he did not message people randomly, but only those who seemed to be in line with the direction of the process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Guillaume Branche's approach to game development paid off immensely, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is quickly becoming one of the most successful role-playing games released in recent times. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kazma5qkd2r37qfwftqh3lct/post/3loiolfljys25?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just today</a>, it was confirmed that the game sold 2 million copies worldwide in only 12 days of availability, which is an incredible result considering it's also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library. This massive success is wholly deserved, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an excellent game that no fan of the genre should pass on, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Nowadays everything is an Xbox, and that includes Sony's PS5. Last month, the console's best-selling games all came from its rival publisher.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/?sf277169095=1">shared by Sony</a>, the number one downloaded game on PS5 for April in Europe was the newly-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Minecraft.</p>
<p>In the US and Canada it was a similar story: Oblivion top, followed by Minecraft and Forza Horizon 5.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was also a best-seller (fourth in Europe, sixth in the US) - a game that has been heavily promoted by Xbox and is also available on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the previously Xbox exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has been selling well on Sony's console, too.</p>

While impressive, that figure doesn’t tell the whole story, given Oblivion Remastered also launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, as well as straight into Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we have a new milestone: after just one week on sale, Oblivion Remastered became the third best-selling game in the U.S. of 2025 so far by dollar sales. That’s according to Circana’s Mat Piscatella, who took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3logoljt5lk2d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to say Oblivion Remastered trails only Monster Hunter: Wilds and Assassin’s Creed: Shadows at the top of the 2025 sales chart.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that Circana’s sales charts do not include players via subscription services. So, we know that Oblivion Remastered is a sales hit despite also being available on Microsoft's Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this success, it seems inevitable that more remasters of Bethesda games will follow, with most suggesting either Fallout 3 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">it was leaked back in 2023</a>) or Fallout: New Vegas are next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If either game is indeed next, what should players expect? Bruce Nesmith, one of Fallout 3’s designers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-success-ex-bethesda-dev-expects-a-fallout-3-remaster-would-significantly-improve-the-not-good-gun-combat">has pointed to Fallout 3’s “not good” gun combat</a>, which he expects Bethesda would improve significantly for a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VideoGamer</u></a>, Nesmith said Fallout 3 Remastered would have shooting more in-line with that of Fallout 4. “What did you see in Fallout 4? That will tell you what they felt was necessary to change from Fallout 3,” Nesmith said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know in Fallout 4 there was a lot of work done on the gun combat, because Fallout 3 is the first time they ever tried to do a shooter-style game. And, well, I think the work that was done was amazing.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they’re doing the same thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oblivion wasn’t just brought up to the 2011 version of Skyrim,” he added. “It was brought up to something that, at least on the surface, looks like it exceeds the most recent graphics update in Skyrim.” Nesmith has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-designer-says-bethesdas-remaster-is-so-impressive-it-could-be-called-oblivion-20"><u>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is so impressive it could be called “Oblivion 2.0.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Bethesda, which is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a> and, maybe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation"><u>more Starfield</u></a>.

            <p>Someone has already decoded the strange, banana-like text in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. They have found the mon-key to unlocking it all, if you will. </p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/random-youtuber-cracks-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-language-before-launch">Nintendo Life</a>, last week YouTuber 2Chrispy released a video detailing how he had gone about deciphering the strange text seen throughout Donkey Kong Bananza's trailers, gameplay footage, website and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">even the Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>

<p>The YouTuber said after he spotted the language in Donkey Kong Bananza, he began to wonder if Nintendo had in fact hidden a secret alphabet in its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/imagining-and-deciphering-writing-systems-for-games">much like it had done in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. And, it turns out it has.</p>
<p>Thanks to more patience than I could ever hope to possess and a good recollection of the Nintendo Treehouse presentation, 2Chrispy used the in-game term 'Chip Exchange' as a starting point. As a reminder, because I had forgotten, during Nintendo's Donkey Kong Banaza Treehouse stream, a notice appeared when the player picked up a Banandium Chip. "Trade these for bananas at any Chip Exchange," this pop up read.</p>
<p>2Chrispy realised the symbol for the Banandium Chip also showed up in the game above a sign with that strange text. The YouTuber noticed the text beneath this symbol had the same number of characters as the word 'Exchange'. Additionally, the text started and ended with the same symbol, which looked a bit like a back to front E. Using this new found information, he started to fill out his "Bananabet", looking for recurring patterns in the game's text and using tools such as a word finder to keep the decoding efforts going.</p>
<p>Other words 2Chrispy managed to find included the likes of 'Welcome' and 'Hint'. There is even an in-game sign players will be able to find, which according to 2Chrispy's translations reads:</p>
<p>"Message. Thank you for reading. Someone."</p>
<p>All in all, this really is quite an impressive feat from the YouTuber, and if you are interested in Donkey Kong Bananza's world building, I really suggest checking out 2Chrispy's video (see below). It's a fascinating and really rather engaging watch.</p>

			<p>Captain Blood is a name that conjures up nostalgic memories for older gamers, the title being first used for a critically acclaimed Amiga game featuring a galactic storyline. That’s not the Captain Blood that’s going under the microscope today, though this is still a game with its own fascinating history. Originally planned for release in 2010, the game had already been affected by delays and a shift from the original Xbox to the 360, but was cancelled due to legal issues and the team disbanding. Jump ahead a decade and a full build was leaked online to spark a small amount of interest, and no, in the grand old year of 2025, Captain Peter Blood is set to finally ship out, sail the seas and bring piratical justice to the Spanish on behalf of good old Blighty. Does that tortured history mean that this is a treasure being brought to the light or is it a dodgy mug of grog that’ll see you heaving over the side of the boat?</p>
<p><iframe title="CAPTAIN BLOOD RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, Captain Blood looks its age. It is presented in a higher resolution than would originally have been possible, but the textures and character models have a chunkiness that scream of the mid-2000s. Personally I really dig that as it’s an artstyle that has been somewhat lost to time – most nostalgic aesthetics go back to an earlier date. It reminded me a lot of the Toby Gard cult classic Galleon, but with a PS2-era God of War makeover. This is very much an old school beat ’em up with hundreds of cannon fodder enemies and a vast amount of blood to be spilled.</p>


<p>I was impressed by the music here, with many of the background tunes having just enough of a Hans Zimmer Pirates of the Caribbean vibe to feel perfectly suited whilst clearly being legally distinct. The same praise can’t be granted to the voice acting, however. Not because it’s bad per se, but because the mix is bloody awful and you’ll mostly miss out on whatever is being said and have to rely on subtitles instead. This is ironically a problem that mostly affects modern film and TV, so it’s not something that can be put down to the nostalgic presentation.</p>


<p>Despite his ominous moniker, Captain Peter Blood is very much the scoundrel hero in this story. Taking place in the 17th century during the various skirmishes and sea battles over control of the Caribbean, the narrative is surprisingly down to earth and lacking the kind of supernatural aspects I was expecting after years of Disney’s takes on the setting. The enemies are made up of dastardly pirates and the even more despicable Spanish (within the game of course) with a limited range of enemy types and several boss battles. Blood is happy to serve the orders of the British, but is more concerned with riches than patriotism.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, the majority of the action is a very standard early God of War clone with far more simple mechanics and little in the way of subtlety and sophistication. Ironically this makes it stand out far more nowadays than it would have if it was released when originally planned since this is a genre that has fallen out of fashion – especially considering the direction Kratos himself has taken in recent years. While clearly a fully 3D title, the combat has a lot in common with traditional lane-based beat ’em ups and button mashing combos are the order of the day.</p>

<p>The vast majority of your fighting will take place with your trusty cutlass, but secondary weapons can be picked up and used for a limited time, with the two-handed sword being great for clearing out groups of enemies. There are some oddities here, though, with one weapon labelled a hatchet but clearly being a large sword. You can even find the odd musket to give you a ranged approach alongside your normal pistol – a rechargeable gun that is mostly used to stagger enemies and interrupt their attacks.</p>
<p>There are a decent amount of combos to unlock with the gold you’ll find along your journey but I found that a couple of these were far more useful than others – especially ones that have an unblockable component so much of the game involved spamming the same two or three attacks. There was even a trophy to unlock for only using one combo for a whole level which seemed as if the developers knew this was a valid approach. Despite the effectiveness of such combos, it is far too easy to get stunlocked and killed by mobs of enemies and I died more to this than the boss battles. There are several ship battle sections which see you manning cannons to sink your foes whilst fighting off any that board your vessel. These are fine but don’t add much other than variety.</p>

<p>Bosses are often puzzles to be solved, with environmental aspects needing to be considered and a couple being mostly QTE sequences – did you forget this was a mid-2000s game? These sequences are fine but definitely feel like an aspect that add little to the experience. Another thing that hasn’t aged gracefully is the representation of women here. There are a grand total of two female characters, one being a stereotypical damsel in distress and the other a femme fatale (the whole spectrum of femininity in games of this era) but both are dressed in skimpy outfits and have built in buoyancy aids. This actually makes Disney seem progressive in comparison!</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Captain Blood is an odd release as it feels like a relic of its original release context. This does leave it being a nostalgic experience for those old enough to remember this era of games, but there isn’t much that isn’t done much better by its influences. Releasing decades later actually does it a favour as it feels very different to the expansive open world experiences that dominate modern gaming. As a curiosity it makes for an interesting time but it mostly confirms why such games belong in the past. Not so much buried treasure, but it's certainly better than walking the plank.	</p></div>

		<p>One of the most beloved, if slightly odd, franchises from the Sega Megadrive era is going to return with Ecco the Dolphin creator, Ed Annunziata, heading up a team that will remaster the first two games and create a third title.</p>
<p>An 8,500 hour countdown started on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eccothedolphin.com</a>, that is equivalent to&nbsp; almost a year so we will be getting the full reveal, or perhaps even the games, at the end of April 2026.</p>


<p>“Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games,” Annunziata <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">says.</a> “Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities. Stay tuned to eccothedolphin.com.”</p>
<p>Annunziata’s involvement may surprise some as he sued Sega for ownership rights of the Ecco IP when he tried to make a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/26/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-kickstarting-the-big-blue/">sequel via Kickstarter</a>.&nbsp; A settlement was reached, but the details were never revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ecco the Dolphin - Mega Drive - Gameplay" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnHg210DDnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original game had you playing as Ecco as he swam through the seas and travels to the Arctic Ocean where he meets a whale called Big Blue. Its here things start to get a bit odd as Ecco then has to collect orbs of power from Atlantis to charge up Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth.&nbsp; The dolphin then uses a time travel machine to nip back to meet some dinosaurs, learns to talk to a Pteranodon, then zips through a portal in to outer space where he fights and alien queen. Not THE Alien Queen, but that is a movie I want to see, Ripley the Dolphin!</p>

<p>A sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time was released, and Ecco games continued to be made in later years, but these were for educational porpoises.</p>
<p>The first two games were also ported to numerous system and could be played as part of the Sega Genesis Collection on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
