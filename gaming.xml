Personally, I’d go for the Disc Edition—it’s just $50 more, and you get the flexibility of physical games, which you can buy, sell, or trade later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer the Digital Edition, the NBA 2K25 bundle is a smart pick if you can find it in stock, as it includes a game. On the other hand, the Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle, while eye-catching, doesn’t include a game—just something to keep in mind. These deals will end after Cyber Monday on December 2, so act fast to avoid disapointment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will the PS5 Pro Be Discounted for Cyber Monday?</h3></div><div catalogid="22330e1e-28c7-4dd9-bdc4-9851a9ac43c6" id="210194"><div id="210194" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation 5 Pro</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Short answer, no. Long answer: While major hardware discounts are rarely a sure thing on brand-new releases, Cyber Monday might bring some unexpected deals. In the announcement for Sony's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">lineup of holiday deals</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-black-friday-2024-sale-predictions">PS5 Pro</a> was (unsurprisingly) nowhere to be found. However, some retailers could surprise shoppers with modest discounts or exclusive PS5 Pro bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review">PS5 Slim</a>, for example, was released last year at a similar time and ended up getting a free game bundle (Spider-Man 2 or Modern Warfare 3) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-ps5-slim-spider-man-2-and-call-of-duty-ps5-black-friday-bundles">at the end of November</a>. We’ll be keeping an eye out to see if any retailers step up with a Cyber Monday special.</p></div><p id="playstation-vr-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PlayStation VR 2">PlayStation VR 2 is $349 for Black Friday</h2></p><div catalogid="5daeac12-bdd9-4053-b6ac-ac98bab9c7de" id="211422"><div id="211422" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation VR 2 - Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best Cyber Monday deals is the PSVR2 Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle, now just $349—a massive $251 discount. It’s the same price as the standalone PSVR2 during this sale, but the bundle is the clear winner, including an incredible game to showcase the headset's power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this price, the PSVR2 is a strong competitor to budget-friendly options like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyber-monday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024">Meta Quest</a>, offering a premium VR experience at an accessible price. If you’ve been waiting to step into high-performance virtual reality, this deal is too good to pass up.</p></div><p id="ps5-ssd-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PS5 SSD deals">Cyber Monday Deals on PS5 SSDs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 games continue to grow in size, and with SSD prices climbing in 2024, finding the right storage at a great price is more important than ever. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> now here, there are plenty of discounts to explore. For example, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bgo2?object_uuid=b2079bf5-f109-4861-be4c-78e53621e28a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD Black SN850X 2TB SSD</a> with a heatsink is currently available for $133.99, offering excellent value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that not all SSDs are compatible with the PS5. To ensure optimal performance, you'll need a PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 drive with a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s to match the console's internal storage. To simplify your search, we've curated a list of SSDs that meet or exceed these requirements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PS Plus Cyber Monday Deal (Save 30%)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/54151004493-d618819f1a-k-1732112194364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Save up to 30% on PS Plus during Black Friday 2024.

Waiting for Cyber Monday can be risky – the hottest gaming deals tend to sell out fast. This is why Black Friday tends to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">the better time to buy video games</a>. Frankly, if you see a game deal you like, we'd recommend hopping on it now. But if you missed out on the PS5 2K25 bundle (or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-bundle-2024-new-live">any of the insanely popular Switch bundles</a>), there might still be hope come Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

<p>"From Tokyo 2099 to the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, and to Hydra Charteris Base and Klyntar, Galacta has assembled more heroes to take on the ultimate challenge," NetEase teases. "Who will you choose as your main to save the Multiverse on December 6th?"</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals is an upcoming free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter for PC with the backing of Chinese publishing giant NetEase.</p>
<p>Described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", Marvel Rivals pits teams of six against each other as they fight it out over a variety of destructible environments with characters from across the Marvel universe. Head of Marvel Games Jay Ong said Marvel Rivals is one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects", and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals finally releases in full on 6th December 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-tos-contains-a-non-disparagement-clause-to-prevent-players-giving-negative-reviews">NetEase was forced to apologise earlier this year</a> when players and content creators hit back at Marvel Rivals for a playtest terms of service contract that prohibited players from making "statements that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>In a statement posted in Discord shortly after the contract began to make headlines, the Marvel Rivals Content Creator Team said it "sincerely apologised" for the "miscommunication and your unpleasant experiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In terms of video game deals, quite a few have caught our eye that have been brought over into the retailer's Cyber Monday sale, including an excellent discount on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1LZE?object_uuid=2b1cd6e2-864e-4a08-b68c-ca70a8b4fe28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0C93LGYCN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch owners can enjoy a nice 63% discount on this collection, which has brought its price down to just $18.74. According to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C93LGYCN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>, it's the lowest price its hit so far which is a massive bonus. A lot of deals like this won't stick around long after Cyber Monday, so if you've been wanting to add this stealthy series to your game library, now's the time.</p><div catalogid="e6bf14dc-1201-4240-b1c4-1ff7a2ef1ca2" id="212612"><div id="212612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty in this collection to keep you busy all throughout the holidays, too. It comes with Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Metal Gear (NES/FC version), and Snake’s Revenge. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> hopefully dropping sometime soon, there's never been a better time to sneak back into this series of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's got even more gaming deals in its Cyber Monday sale that are worth adding to your virtual shopping cart. Some big ones that got our attention were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Star Wars Outlaws, which remains on sale at $40 from Black Friday</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Sonic X Shadow Generations, which is down to just $30</a>. These just scratch the surface of what the retailer currently has available, though. To see more of our favorite deals outside of games, have a look at our breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Amazon's Cyber Monday sale</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday are likely to return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. Amazon, in particular, has already shifted gears to highlight its Cyber Monday deals early, so expect some amazing sales ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 1, 2024 3:16 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The leaked materials, which have details for a dual-fan ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC GPU, suggest that the new chip may feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 160-bit memory bus.</p><p>The leak also indicates that Intel’s Arc B570 chip could come with the 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 2.6GHz GPU clock, along with support for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><p>The rumored specs for the Arc B570’s slightly more powerful counterpart — the Arc B580 — have been floating around as well. An early Amazon listing <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-b570-specs-leaked-18-xe2-cores-10gb-memory-and-pcie-4-0x8">spotted by <em>VideoCardz</em></a> suggests that the Arc B580 could arrive with 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 192-bit memory bus, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, and an 8-pin PCIe power connector.</p><p>Judging by these specs, it seems Intel’s Battlemage chips are designed to compete with more affordable graphics cards, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600</a>. Though we still don’t know how much Intel’s new chips will cost, a product listing shared by <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861788237456711881%7Ctwgr%5E0f3b2be26b93fa4b7b0634731f5fc84a40464720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F24309086%2Fintel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">@Momomo_us</a> shows Intel’s “Limited Edition” B580 card priced at $250 — less than the $399 RTX 4060Ti and $269 Radeon RX 7600.</p><p>The reveal of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs is just days away, as the company confirmed that it will make an Arc-related announcement on December 3rd at 9AM ET from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intelgaming">its YouTube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since he hasn’t been in a giant franchise…yet, his box office numbers aren’t as big as some of his contemporaries. However, he’s made up for it with nine acting Oscar nominations and two wins. His new film “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/in-gladiator-ii-denzel-washington-is-a-villain-unlike-1851704950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/in-gladiator-ii-denzel-washington-is-a-villain-unlike-1851704950">Gladiator II</a></span>” is already creating buzz for a tenth nomination and has become one of his most successful films with its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/black-hollywood-excellence-two-black-led-films-wicke-1851707332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/black-hollywood-excellence-two-black-led-films-wicke-1851707332">huge opening weekend</a></span>.</p><p>With the legend poised to take over the Broadway stage in “Othello,” then bring the project on screen, possibly appear in “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/five-characters-we-want-to-see-denzel-washington-portra-1851696651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/five-characters-we-want-to-see-denzel-washington-portra-1851696651">Black Panther 3</a></span>,” once again work with Spike Lee, collaborate with Steve McQueen and make two more “Equalizer” films, we need to take a few moments and celebrate all things Denzel Washington with his highest grossing movies worldwide, per <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1778156289/?ref_=bo_hm_rd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1778156289/?ref_=bo_hm_rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a></span>. </p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Friday, November 29.</em></p></div></div><div><p>The amazing thing about “American Gangster” is that it has so many quotable moments and everyone has their favorite. It’s why we keep coming back to it over and over.</p></div><div><p>In just its first week of worldwide release, the follow up to the Oscar winning epic is already one of the acting icon’s most successful films. If it continues on its current path, it won’t take long for it to jump into the No. 1 spot. We know he’s supposed to be the villain, but how can we ever truly root against our king.</p></div><div><p>Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds isn’t a team we were expecting, but somehow their two different styles work in this fun, good vs. evil action film.</p></div><div><p>What makes Washington so fantastic in “Philadelphia” is how you can still discover something new in his performance all these years later. He and Tom Hanks are perfection here.</p></div><div><p>If you like government conspiracy thrillers and major movie stars, this ‘90s hit is probably one of your favorites. If we’re being honest, we weren’t expecting it to be this high.</p></div><div><p>In his first outing as “The Equalizer,” Denzel entered the action hero conversation with a brutal, violent trip to a big box hardware store. We’ll never look at Home Depot or Lowe’s the same way again.</p></div><div><p>This was meant to feel like a final chapter, but we’ll watch Washington “equalize” problems forever if he keeps making these awesome movies.</p></div><div><p>Just in case you’re wondering, that’s a franchise total of $573,798,455. Half a billion dollars for an action franchise led by a Black actor is a major deal.</p></div><div><p>Every time Spike Lee and Washington team up, it’s magic. The way “Inside Man” unravels its complicated web is beautiful and even more fun on subsequent viewings. And of course, in a ridiculously star-studded cast, Denzel is a spectacular anchor.</p></div><div><p>Spoiler alert for a movie from 2006: the time travel plot is a lot. Don’t think too hard about it or you’ll get a headache.</p></div><div><p>Not only were we not expecting this runaway train epic to crack the top 10, it’s also surprising to see how evenly split the box office is between domestic and international numbers. It brought in $81.5 million domestic and $86.2 million globally.</p></div><div><p>Despite a cast that includes Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, we’re giving all the credit for this western’s success to Washington. </p></div><div><p>Washington delivers another classic performance in “Flight,” but we’re still not happy about his character’s fate.</p></div><div><p>Washington and Gene Hackman go toe to toe in this thriller that somehow feels relevant again.</p></div><div><p>Word on the street is we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-book-of-eli-prequel-series-john-boyega-shopping-network-1235799330/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-book-of-eli-prequel-series-john-boyega-shopping-network-1235799330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Book of Eli” prequel series</a></span> starring John Boyega. He’s an amazing actor who can definitely bring the emotional weight required for the role. But that doesn’t mean we don’t want a Washington cameo if possible.</p></div><div><p>As quadriplegic forensics investigator Lincoln Rhyme, Washington brilliantly conveys his character’s emotional upheaval without venturing into pity or mockery.</p></div><div><p>We’re not claiming this is one of his instant classics, but clearly some people enjoyed it. Even amongst John Travolta’s overacting, Washington is rock solid.</p></div><div><p>If you don’t like “Remember the Titans” we have serious questions about all your life choices.</p></div><div><p>Even when you’re a legend, they won’t all be winners. We’re totally blaming Mark Wahlberg for the lower box office total.</p></div><div><p>If this were a list of Washington’s best action movies, “Man on Fire” would definitely be in the top five. It’s his unmatched ability to draw you in and make you truly feel every single one of Creasy’s emotions that makes him so great.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-recommend-id="image://4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="697" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Film Real/YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-recommend-id="image://4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="697" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Following the Sept. 11 attacks, this 1998 film about similar attacks in NYC leading to martial law sort of faded away, as it was a little too real in how it portrayed the United States’ response to the situation.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There is no avoiding the (mechanical) elephant in the room so let’s get it out of the way: Boy oh boy does this game look and play like Sony’s Horizon franchise. A female protagonist with a bow and a big stick for finishers? Check. Set in the far future over multiple biomes including lush rainforests and deserts? Check. Giant mechanical beasts with weak points that glow, that look and even move the same as those in Horizon? Check. Even the music is similar.</p>
<p>There are natives, dressed exactly the same as those in Horizon, the protagonist has a glider exactly the same as Horizon, there’s red grass for stealth, the trailer has characters entering a cave and finding cave paintings a scene lifted from the original HZD Trailer. But hey, completing ripping off one franchise isn’t enough so why not take the Ghost from Destiny and add them in as well, including the exact same scanning animation. </p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While Horizon can’t lay claim to inventing mechanical beasties, Zoids were doing that back in the 80s, the art style is so similar you could honestly think some of of this trailer was from a Horizon game. </p>
<p>However, Light of Motiram is an open world survival game rather than an action adventure so there is base building, crafting and all that sort of thing. So that’s different and absolutely, totally not the sort of thing that would be in Sony’s upcoming Horizon online multiplayer title. </p>

<p>Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam </a>and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first. </p>

            <p>A teaser for an unreleased Lego James Bond game has leaked online.</p>
<p>Whilst there's very little information accompanying the leak - apparently, it just popped up on Iinterni Gamer's Discord server at 2 am one day - it appears that at one stage, TT Games was considering a blocktastic bonanza based on Bond.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the trailer is still live, and several mirrors have been uploaded - you can check it out below:</p>

</span></p><p>"This trailer got leaked surprisingly on my Discord server, and it's an official trailer cause literally everything that appears looks exactly as the previous trailer but with final designs. Possibly its [sic] on reddit but [I don't know] really," wrote the uploader in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkSR8L8Gjwc">YouTube description</a>.</p><p>Rather than being based on one particular Bond or movie, the teaser features a number of iconic portrayals and films, including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill. For the full-minute-long run-time, a disclaimer states: "Confidential (TT Games Studio) - Not for distribution. R&amp;D content only - not representative of any final products".</p>

</span></p><p>"This wasn't actually for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a> year 3 [as described in the reddit thread], it was produced as a pitch for The Lego Group to convince them to give the okay for a full game, it was made during the last year Dimensions was being worked on when TT knew Dimensions wouldn't get a third year of content," they said.</p>
<p>"Once again, TLG decided Bond wasn't suitable, and vetoed the project. I think this has been found in the data of a Dimensions build, which is where the confusion is coming from."</p>
<p>"This was around 2016, and LEGO specifically were not happy with the violence and sexual innuendo," they added in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/comment/lz97qu1/">follow-up comment</a>.</p>
<p>"Characters called Pussy Galore and Plenty O'Tool wouldn't really work in a family-friendly Lego game. Although I'm sure TT could make it work. TLG these days seems more willing to try different things in games, so it could potentially be revisited, the biggest barrier for TT would be WB forcing them to stick to owned IP."</p><p>If you want to expand your IRL Lego collection, you're in luck - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/physical-lego-horizon-adventures-set-sees-aloy-taking-on-a-bricky-shell-walker-and-sawtooth">Lego has just unveiled a new Horizon set</a>.

		<p>NBA 2K23 is no longer available to purchase from digital storefronts, as 2K delisted it overnight. This was expected as 2K had confirmed this would be happening in September, and follows the general pattern of NBA 2K game servers being shut down a couple of years after release. NBA 2K23 was released on September 9th, 2022.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K23 | MyCAREER Trailer | 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khEO9BDIlio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you attempt to search for NBA 2K23 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, Steam, and the Nintendo eShop you will hit different results. For example, on the Xbox Store, PlayStation Store, and Steam store there will be no listing for the NBA 2K23. While on the Nintendo eShop the game page is still up, but with only the option to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/NBA-2K23-2266457.html">wishlist NBA 2K23</a>. The physical editions of NBA 2K23 can still be purchased from various retailers.</p>
<p>On December 31st, the servers for NBA 2K23 will be shutdown. 2K states exactly what this means. <em>“After this date, you will no longer be able to play multiplayer games or access any online game modes. MyCAREER and MyTEAM will no longer be available, and it will no longer be possible to earn Virtual Currency (VC). While you will still be able to enjoy Play Now, MyNBA, The W, and MyWNBA, any features that require a connection to 2K servers will be unavailable. This includes multiplayer, Online Leagues, and community sharing.”</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cod-movement-mechanics-dev-reveals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98a-massive-problem%E2%80%99-cod-dev-reveals-why-movement-mechanics-were-slowed-after-mw19.1048926/</guid>

<p>On social media, a Treyarch developer has written a transparent post explaining why Call of Duty’s movement seemed to slow down after 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. He also explained why certain mechanics aren’t all that effective in Black Ops 6, despite them having been a staple in the Call of Duty space for many years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faster-is-not-always-healthier">‘Faster is Not Always Healthier’</h2>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/MaTtKs/status/1862340934832132335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>, Treyarch’s Matt Scronce confirmed – in a way – that movement mechanics were slowed dramatically after MW19 because ‘faster is not always healthier’. He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once prone and crouch speeds become too fast, you end up with mismatch between 1st and 3rd person POV leading to “snaking” which has been a massive problem in the past.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Modern Warfare’s movement mechanics were fast-paced and intense, with slide cancelling, snaking, and jump shots making up the meta that eventually worked into Warzone when it was released in March 2020. These elements remained, but players were forced to contend with slower, heavier games that felt nerfed in terms of movement.</p>



<p>Scronce’s comments were posted in response to a video comparing Black Ops 6 and MW19, showing how much slower the game has become over the years, particularly movement mechanics like jumping.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never personally been a fan of spamming jump during combat, so when we intentionally designed omnimovement mechanics, we adjusted sway/bob when jumping by default to ensure that wasn’t the most effective tactic during engagements. </p>



<p>If you want to spam jump while shooting, we have Perks and Attachments to increase effectiveness just like we do for slide and dive.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’ve been relying on jump shots for all these years and wondered why you’re having no luck hitting your shots now when doing so, that’s your explanation in black and white.</p>



<p>Scronce signed off with a reassurance that Treyarch is always evaluating feedback and making improvements based on the community’s sentiment.</p>

<p>Delta Force is preparing to go head-to-head with the likes of Arena Breakout: Infinite and Escape from Tarkov in the extraction shooter world. Recently, it was revealed that the developers are willing to work with a relatively controversial mechanic to compete with the games that spearhead the genre.</p>



<p>When Delta Force’s extraction mode hits an end-of-season ‘wipe’, players will be able to decide if they want to opt in or not. That means that with each new season, players can carry their progress over rather than wiping and starting from the beginning.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-a-decision">Make a Decision</h2>



<p>For the extraction shooter community, a regular wipe makes sense. It ensures that things remain balanced, allowing players to all sit at the same level once every so often. In Escape from Tarkov, wipes typically occur once every six months, and when each wipe arrives, so too does a major game update that changes the playing field.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Escape from Tarkov’s developer, Battlestate Games, released a PvE mode in the game that allows users to play indefinitely without undergoing a wipe, and that was a hit with many players – particularly those who don’t have the time to grind once every six months.</p>



<p>Delta Force is following in those footsteps – in a way.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that when a wipe arrives at the end of each three-month season in Delta Force, players are given the choice to either wipe and start fresh or retain what they’ve earned and unlocked and keep playing as normal.</p>



<p>There’s a twist, though. If you choose to wipe, you’ll unlock exclusive rewards and abilities, one of which is the opportunity to spawn as a boss character and take enemies down using powerful weapons. </p>



<p>It’s entirely up to you.</p>



<p>Will you be wiping in Delta Force, or would you prefer to stick with the same gear forever? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you thought Fortnite didn’t have much left in the tank, you’d be sorely mistaken. Recently, the game reached new heights during the Juice WLRD finale event, racking up a whopping <strong>14.3 million </strong>concurrent players, a new all-time high for the game. </p>



<p>This new record effectively decimated the number secured by the arrival of Fortnite OG last year. When the game’s original map was reintroduced, just north of 11 million concurrent players found their way into the game, but that record has been left standing in the dust.</p>



<hr>







<p>Fortnite’s live events are nothing short of monumental, and they never fail to attract millions of users. </p>



<p>In the past, we’ve seen the likes of Travis Scott, DJ Marshmello, J Balvin, and Ariana Grande appear in Fortnite to perform live shows before millions of fans. Typically, these shows have been accompanied by in-game events, limited-time bundles, and skins.</p>



<p>The most recent event brought about an end to Chapter 5, and it saw the late Juice WLRD perform tracks while accompanied by jaw-dropping visuals.</p>



<p>This is a new bar for Fortnite, and it will likely go untouched for some time. </p>



<p>Fortnite’s newest season starts today. The launch trailer for the new season dropped a couple of days ago and it showcased some upcoming content, including a Godzilla-themed event, of all characters. </p>



<p>It has been a glowing year or two for Fortnite. From the arrival of the new UEFN to the success of Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing, Fortnite is in top form and continuing to impress gamers after almost ten years on the market.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Chapter 5? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel has released the launch trailer for Marvel Rivals, which launches worldwide on December 5. The trailer, which is reminiscent of an anime opening sequence, showcases many of the hero characters coming to the game, and there are a few easter eggs and references sprinkled in for good measure.</p>



<p>It’s an energetic trailer that has fans stoked for what’s to come. Check it out below.</p>

<h2 id="h-avengers-assemble">Avengers Assemble</h2>



<p>I love the trailer for Marvel Rivals – particularly the sequence that unfolds midway through showcasing a gaggle of characters replicating the iconic group shot seen in 2012’s The Avengers.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer to add a little more fuel to your hype train:</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is set to compete against the likes of Deadlock and Overwatch in the hero shooter space. Recently, we covered Gaming World Media’s interview with Bogur, a professional Overwatch personality who will be diving head-first into Marvel Rivals when it’s released on December 5.</p>

<p>On YouTube, a trailer for a cancelled LEGO James Bond project that would have been developed by TT Games has emerged. It’s only 50 seconds long, but it showcases a game that was reportedly scrapped several years ago, about the time when LEGO Dimensions was discontinued.</p>



<p>It has been claimed online that the game was being pieced together during ‘the last year LEGO Dimensions was being worked on’ in 2016, but it was ultimately decided that James Bond wasn’t a suitable franchise to focus on due to the ‘violence and sexual innuendo’ that the series is famed for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brick-by-brick">Brick by Brick</h2>



<p>LEGO has dabbled with many game-based franchises over the years, ranging from Star Wars to Indiana Jones, but it never delivered a James Bond project. Given the expansiveness of the JB universe, it seems as though a LEGO series would write itself – and with the release of this leaked trailer, we now know how close we came to that being realised.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer that was released on YouTube (live at the time of publishing):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leaked Unreleased LEGO James Bond Game Trailer - FINAL VERSION (READ DESCRIPTION)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkSR8L8Gjwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases iconic scenes from various James Bond projects, and for something that was scrapped quite early on, it looks relatively polished. It seems as though it was set to be a fully voiced game, which was starting to be the standard for LEGO games around the time that LEGO JB was reportedly being developed.</p>



<p>Sadly, LEGO James Bond was lost to the abyss of time and won’t ever see the light of day.</p>

<p>Ella Purnell, one of the faces of the Fallout TV show that debuted on Prime this year, is soaking up source material in anticipation of the show’s second season. Purnell, who plays Lucy MacLean, fronted the Emmy Award-winning show when the first season was released in April, working alongside Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten to bring the post-apocalyptic universe to life.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, Purnell revealed that she’s been instructed to play Fallout: New Vegas to ‘prep for a certain job I may or may not be on soon’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-wasteland">Back to the Wasteland</h2>



<p>Fallout premiered in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, emerging as one of Prime’s biggest launches ever. It proved to be a boon for the entire franchise, as player counts soared across everything from Fallout 4 to the online title, Fallout 76. It was a resurgence of sorts for the series, and for a while, Fallout mania was running wild.</p>



<p>On Bluesky, Ella Purnell posted that she’s playing Fallout: New Vegas – on Xbox – in preparation for filming the show’s second season, which was due to start in November but may have been delayed, if Purnell’s post is anything to go by.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Purnell responded to some fan requests to head north through Quarry Junction after starting the game, realising several hours later how much of a mistake that was. New Vegas veterans will understand why that’s such a problem.</p>



<p>This morning, Purnell posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously time isn’t on my side to absorb all the source material in time. I will still absorb the game until I’m called to the wasteland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout: New Vegas is considered the best game in the series by many, and we <strong>know </strong>that it’s the setting for the second season per the closing moments of the show’s first season.</p>
