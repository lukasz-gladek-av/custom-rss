		<p>When Warren Spector was a producer at Origin Systems in the 1990s, he had a business model. “I would start up four projects, two internal and two external, and I’d kill two projects every year that weren’t going well,” he says in Jason Schreier’s book <em>Press Start: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</em>. “I would tell people that’s what I was going to do. ‘Be one of the projects that’s going really well.’”</p><p>Victorious in Spector’s system were <em>Ultima Underworld</em> and <em>System Shock, </em>the forerunners of what became known as the immersive sim. Games in this genre present an obstacle and allow the player to surmount it in multiple ways: climb over it, blow it up, tell it to move, swim underneath it, whichever way they choose. Over time, the tools got more inventive: possess rats and squeeze through a sewer grate, hack a robot to destroy something, transform into a coffee cup and roll underneath an obstacle.</p><p>Spector repeated his approach for the 2000 title <em>Deus Ex</em>, still the apotheosis of the immersive sim, by constituting two design teams and pitting them in conflict, which he later called “<a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/history-lesson-the-story-of-deus-ex/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>probably the stupidest thing I’ve ever done</u></a>.” In that contest, designer Harvey Smith triumphed; he headed up <em>Deus Ex</em>’s sequel and, in 2012, moved onto <em>Dishonored</em>, with the studio Arkane Austin. “<em>Dishonored</em>,”<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/2/14798096/deus-ex-warren-spector-vr-virtual-reality-dumb-down-games?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>said Spector</u></a>, “is the series that best captures the spirit of <em>Deus Ex</em> now.”</p><p>Arkane, which at one point operated out of studios in Lyon, France, as well as Austin, Texas, has spent most of its life iterating on the immersive sim, as has Smith, becoming the foremost developer in this genre. So it’s no surprise that Arkane Austin’s latest and last game, <em>Redfall</em> — a multiplayer vampire shooter either a conscious departure from the immersive sim or an attempt to graft it upon a more commercial business model — evidently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda?ref=remapradio.com"><u>performed poorly enough to shutter the studio</u></a> earlier this year.</p><p>Immersive sims, despite their flexibility of approach, train players to be specialists. They can become a walking weapons platform, the queen of the shadows, the rat god who rides the wind. A studio of immersive sim experts can’t easily switch tracks and deliver a larger, more commercial title. But then, it’s not like they had a choice.</p><p>While Arkane had become better at making immersive sims through iteration, the games weren’t doing the business they once had. The <em>Dishonored </em>sequel from Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin’s <em>Prey</em> underperformed. Whether or not it contributed directly, the quality that once made an immersive sim special — the ability to “play your own way” — has been absorbed pretty wholly into the broad open world playgrounds of <em>Skyrim, Fallout</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild. </em>“Most of the things that made immersive sims kind of cutting edge are everywhere in games [now],” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/boss-level-2022-harvey-smith-arkane-studios-3312368?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Smith noted</u></a> before <em>Redfall</em>’s release.</p><p>If those games that drew so directly upon the values of the immersive sim could be huge hits, then perhaps the people best in the world at making immersive sims could play in that space, too. Well, we don’t know, because although Arkane went into the open world for <em>Redfall</em>, its ambitions were more lucrative. Not only were they chasing open-world trends, it was also creating an online-only co-op games-as-a-service shooter in the vein of <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Destiny, </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/arcane-s-redfall-misfire-for-xbox-panned-after-7-5-billion-microsoft-deal?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTY4NTYxODIzNywiZXhwIjoxNjg2MjIzMDM3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJSVktNS1VEV1gyUFMwMSIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eeX5BYdsJhqgSi3aqDZTZUVYmm92ZItcoOCXfP7-j8Q&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>In Schreier’s account at Bloomberg</u></a>, owner ZeniMax Media fancied the project would make itself a more attractive acquisition target for Microsoft, even as the change in direction confounded Arkane Austin hires old and new, who had signed up to work on single-player immersive sims. (Schreier estimates that during <em>Redfall’s</em> development, Arkane Austin lost 70% of the staff that had worked on its previous game, <em>Prey.</em>)&nbsp;</p><p>That is a different, though compatible, explanation than the one<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/big-in-2023-redfall-preview-interview-exclusive/?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>Smith gave</u></a>: “If you work on the same thing for long enough you eventually want to clear your head and stretch a little.” It makes sense for Smith since he has been working on these games since 1994. Though he added, “I think we will eventually go back to the very sealed immersive sim-like environments,” suggesting that “a little” might really be the extent of his interest.</p><p>But whether he was making immersive sims or not, there is the lure of getting back to a hit. “<em>Dishonored</em> was important to me because I was like, well, maybe I just got lucky that one time [with <em>Deus Ex</em>]?” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/boss-level-2022-harvey-smith-arkane-studios-3312368?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Smith said in 2022</u></a>. “<em>Dishonored</em> was like, boom, the whole world paid attention. When that happens to you once it’s awesome. When it happens to you a second time, it validates all the bad moments.” <em>Redfall </em>was a commercial play for a studio that was out of power and wanted it back, if not for the glory, then just to survive.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Redfall</em> feels (and is) a termination of the story Arkane has been telling across all of its games since <em>Dishonored</em>, not just with immersive sims but where power is the central theme. In the <em>Dishonored </em>series, the player is a powerful character — an empress or her protector temporarily embarrassed by a coup — but the game is less interested in the power accorded to them by their positions at the head of empire than the toys they get to play with.&nbsp;</p><p>The true power, in so far as it is interesting to the designers, is supernatural, such as possession, teleportation, or slowing time. And it’s bestowed by a character called the Outsider. As a force, the Outsider is so enigmatic and grim that it’s logical to wonder if his powers are given at a price. What is the cost of a deal with dark forces, struck to advance your quest for the throne?&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing much, as it happens. “There are many myths about how if you want power there is something to trade,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120909031200/http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/dishonoreds-two-lead-designers-talk-about-magic-breaking-the-game-and-amora"><u>observed Raphaël Colantonio</u></a>, who directed the first game with Smith. “When we started to design [<em>Dishonored</em>], we thought it would be interesting to tempt the player with powers, and if they decide to use them the world grows darker. Because it’s an interesting dilemma…. [But] we don’t want to punish players for having fun.” Though the Outsider cuts a brooding figure, he only a spokesman for the freeplay pleasures of the immersive sim: “How you will use what I have given you falls upon you… I will be watching you with great interest.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Bethesda Softworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fun wins, as it usually does in game development, but the original <em>Dishonored</em> was the last time Arkane was so indifferent to the narrative cost of power. <em>Prey</em>, directed by Colantonio, was built around the idea that the player should be tested on whether they deserve the extragenic powers they have been given. If they were found to have used them irresponsibly, they were destroyed. <em>Prey</em>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/video-game-video-game-review-prey-sci-fi-legacy-gaming-gamers-595970?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Colantonio told</u></a> Newsweek<em> </em>in 2017, dealt with “identity, empathy and who you are…. What does it mean to be human?” (Hedging, designer Ricardo Bare added: “You can play it as a science- fiction action game. It’s super fun; the aliens are super deadly.”)</p><p>Not coincidentally, perhaps, as the games embraced nuance the studio’s commercial fortunes declined. Colantonio later said <em>Prey</em> sold horribly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-forced-arkane-to-call-its-game-prey-which-studio-founder-says-was-very-very-hurtful/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>and he left Arkane</u></a> in part over a corporate directive to title the game <em>Prey </em>— in reference to an unrelated IP owned by the parent company — over his objections. “I’m grateful that a company will give me the means to make a game and trust my ability with so many millions of dollars… but there is a bit of the artistic, creative side that is insulted when you tell this artist, ‘Your game is going to be called <em>Prey</em>,’” he said. “I’m not in control of my own boat at this point.”</p><p>In <em>Dishonored</em>, power was fun for its own sake, and when you got your characters back on the throne, a glossy if hazy golden age followed. But everything Arkane has made since <em>Prey </em>has been concerned with the idea of destroying power at its source, even though power is the thing that gives the player means and trusts in their ability.</p><p>The change is best observed with <em>Dishonored</em>’s Outsider, who at the peak of Arkane’s success was an esoteric but in practical terms benevolent stand-in for the game designer: here are your tools, go have fun, as power is play there should be no punishment for it. After <em>Prey </em>and <em>Dishonored 2 </em>didn’t sell up to expectations, the Outsider found himself on trial for his life in the latter game’s DLC: <em>Death of the Outsider</em>. The case for his murder is not well prosecuted, only that he represents a great wellspring of power, and that some of the individuals he chooses to let draw from it might inflict harm upon the world. “The Outsider’s gifts come with a price,” grumbled a character, which has been historically untrue.</p><p>But there <em>was</em> a price, the DLC reveals, one heretofore not glimpsed by the player: The Outsider, far from being a happy champion of play, was forced into his position as a child by a cult of wealthy weirdos. So power never came at a price <em>for the player</em>, but for the game designer figure, there were strings attached. There is a purity to the push-and-pull of the designer-player relationship, but the designer does not often get to be in that position without giving something up. The Outsider does not have to die at the end of the game, but in any event, he is removed from his role as a human transformer of supernatural power. Nobody should have that power, is the final message of the <em>Dishonored</em> series; nobody should make games.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Bethesda Softworks</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wealthy weirdos, a favorite archetype for this sort of thing, returned in Arkane Lyon’s <em>Deathloop</em>, where the power they had cultivated was of immortality on an island where a single day repeats itself eternally. The point of it is that there are no consequences to the free exercise of power — the design philosophy of the first <em>Dishonored</em>, in other words. But in the world of <em>Deathloop</em>, this philosophy reveals itself as grotesque and hedonistic. The player takes on the role of Colt, who is given a share in this power, but as we learn, we were complicit in its creation. His moral imperative is to master the power only for the purpose of destroying it — or revel in it, which is perceived as part of the same deadened hedonism that animates the game’s enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, a player should play a game only for the sake of ending it, which is quite the opposite philosophy to, say, a game-as-a-service hero shooter. But in <em>Redfall</em>, with its always-online vision of Massachusetts as populated by immortal vampires, the object once again is to end power by killing vampires, not to celebrate it. Though the player possesses certain special abilities, the<em> </em>power — the advancement in human evolution that players spent <em>Dishonored, Deus Ex, Prey</em>,<em> </em>and <em>BioShock </em>cultivating in themselves — is now in others, and it codes them as enemies. “Come out,” some roaming goon mocks the player, shortly before they are shot in the head. “Don’t you want to be something better?” Yes! In fact, that used to be the whole point.</p><p><em>Redfall</em> is existentially mixed-up, a narrative about the rejection of power while also simultaneously a gambit by Arkane to get their power back. It’s easy to chalk <em>Redfall</em> up as a wrong turn in the evolution of the immersive sim, an attempt to extrapolate its principles to a demonstrably more popular genre. Except that Microsoft, which acquired Arkane’s parent company ZeniMax in 2021, packaged the announcement of Arkane Austin’s closure with three other studios, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure?ref=remapradio.com"><u>at least one of which had recently delivered a critical hit</u></a>. The message was muddled, as if to say that the success or failure of a studio ultimately weighs little on its survival. Or rather, the message was muddled so as to say nothing at all, for the prerogative of power is not having to explain itself.</p><p>Arkane’s games have always been about power, not power bestowed by weapons or equipment, but concentrated in the individual. Killing the Outsider — and for that matter, spinning up a studio-saving hit in a buzzy, profitable genre — was a kind of fantasy that in the wake of Arkane Austin’s closure looks even more fantastically remote. “Could we kill God?” they ask in <em>Death of the Outsider.</em> “You found a way to kill God?” Can the individual become empowered enough to transcend and escape the systems that could kill it?&nbsp;</p><p>Arkane Austin made great games, on the whole, but it makes for a bad story of its own. Its lights were turned on and then off, in such a way as to emphasize how far out of its control Arkane's own fate had become. The end gave the lie to the premise of the immersive sim: Ultimately, it did not matter how they played it. The player is dead and the Outsider exists eternal, unknowable.</p>

Let’s start with that one: The new(ish) Dialogue Camera toggle.</p><h2 id="h6467"><a id=""></a>The best new option: Dialogue Camera toggle</h2><p>Tired of how <em>Starfield</em> zooms in and frames the NPC you’re talking to in a very rigid, tired sort of way?

And if you really don’t want any of these mechanics, even the ones that appeared in vanilla <em>Starfield</em>, you can also turn off environmental damage and afflictions entirely.</p><h3 id="h6469"><a id=""></a>Sustenance</h3><p>“Sustenance” is one of the new options and, as you might’ve guessed, it challenges you to maintain hunger and thirst levels in two different ways. In “Positive Only,” you won’t suffer for not eating or drinking, but doing so will still give you two new statuses, Fed and Hydrated. They work as follows: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fed: Gained from eating food. Increases health by 30%, melee damage by 15%, and adds 25% additional carrying capacity.</li><li>Hydrated: Gained from drinking. Increases O2 recovery by 30%, sneak attack damage by 15%, and lets you reload guns 25% faster. </li></ul><p>That’s not all Sustenance has to offer. If you want a greater challenge, you can also select “Positive &amp; Negative” which will punish you for not consuming food and water. With this setting on, you’re at risk of the following: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Malnourished: Gained from not eating food. Decreases health by 30%, reduces melee damage by 15%, and docks your carrying capacity by 25%.</li><li>Dehydrated: Gained from not drinking. Decreases O2 recovery by 30%, lowers sneak attack damage by 15%, and reduces reload speed of guns by 25%.</li></ul><p>Bethesda’s vanilla survival options via Sustenance are very simple. You can be in Fed and Hydrated status for just 30 minutes at a time. This means you’re likely to hit Malnourished and Dehydrated fairly often. I like mapping food and water to the left side of the Favorites quick menu to easily snack on something or grab a drink when needed, bypassing the need to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-release-menu-ui-starmap-inventory-xbox-review-1850797661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-release-menu-ui-starmap-inventory-xbox-review-1850797661">dive into <em>Starfield</em>’s clunky menus</a></span>.</p><h3 id="h6470"><a id=""></a>Environmental damage and afflictions</h3><p>Not only can you entirely shut off environmental damage in these settings, you can also make things a little harder for yourself. If you change Environmental Damage &amp; Afflictions to Advanced, you’ll have to manage impacts to your health in addition to status afflictions. When you take on an affliction from the environment, you’ll also start losing health.

Her name has popped up many times in the story, but she makes her official debut in the chapter during Phase 2.<br></p><p>Firefly is out now. She launched with the start of the 2.3 update on June 18. Jade launches in the later half of the update on July 10. Ruan Mei (Ice, Harmony) and Argenti (Erudition, Physical) will run alongside Firefly and Jade respectively.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3 Phase 1 (June 18-July 10): Firefly (Fire, Destruction), Ruan Mei (Ice, Harmony)</li><li><em>Boosted 4-Stars: Gallagher (Fire, Abundance), Misha (Ice, Destruction), Xueyi (Quantum, Destruction)</em></li><li>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3 Phase 2 (July 10-July 30): Jade (Quantum, Erudition), Argenti (Physical, Erudition)</li><li><em>Boosted 4-Stars: Serval (Lightning, Erudition), Natasha (Physical, Abundance), Asta (Fire, Harmony)</em></li></ul><figure id="" data-id="849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-recommend-id="image://849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-recommend-id="image://849440a12a0fbce99cfbb235b796664e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some promo art for Firefly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h6223"><a id=""></a>Should I pull for Firefly or Jade?</h2><p>If you like the look or personality of one character over the other, and only need a little bit of convincing based on their kit, seriously, just go for the one you want. Both Firefly and Jade both have enough strengths to keep you happy if you decide to pull for them.<br></p><p>That said, here are a few reasons why you might consider one or the other, and a few pros and cons for each.<br></p><h3 id="h6224"><a id=""></a>Firefly</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Works well with F2P-friendly characters </li><li>Ultimate immediately makes her take action</li><li>Enhanced Skill and Talent implant Fire weakness</li><li>Takes less damage the lower her HP</li></ul><p>Firefly was already expected to be one of the strongest DPSes in the game upon launch. Now that she’s out and about, we’ve easily concluded that those suspicions are true. All her skills work together to restore health, regenerate energy, push her forward in the turn economy, and even implant weaknesses to enable her Break Effect. These skills make it easier to enable her without the help of popular support characters like Tingyun, Bronya, and Huohuo.<br></p><p>Her Skill increases power and charges her Ultimate, which is where she deals the most damage with enhanced attacks. These attacks don’t require you to use Skill Points, either. She also applies Fire weakness to enemies herself, eliminating the need to implant weaknesses with a character like Silver Wolf. Like many Destruction characters, she consumes HP to increase her attack power, but that isn’t much of an issue when she heals herself, and reduces damage the lower her health is.<br></p><p>She’s also easier to invest in for newer players because of how well she works with easy-to-obtain characters. Harmony Trailblazer is her best teammate thanks to how well she can utilize their Super Break effect. If that wasn’t enough to make you pull for her, Harmony Trailblazer is available for free right now through the “When Charmony Rings Out…” permanent event in the Travel Log section of Star Rail’s phone dashboard. That way, you don’t even need to catch up to Penacony if you just started to unlock Harmony Trailblazer.</p><p>Besides Trailblazer, you can use whichever healer you want and another Harmony or Nihility character to help with skill point management or maximize damage. Firefly notably works well with Ruan Mei, the other five-star running alongside her and a popular support in the Break Effect meta. Gallagher is the best healer because his outgoing healing and debuffs scale based with Break Effect. His Fire element ensures that he can help break Toughness because of Firefly’s implant ability, too.<br></p><p>Many other characters besides Ruan Mei and Gallagher can enable her, even if they won’t work as well. Maybe you raised Asta or still only have Natasha as a healer. Those two would work. I’d still say Ruan Mei is the second best teammate after Harmony Trailblazer, but she’s a five-star. In short, pull for Firefly if you want a strong, self-sufficient hypercarry DPS that leans into the Break Effect meta.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-recommend-id="image://568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2532" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-recommend-id="image://568f7a82cdd4de010f54ddb36088bbf0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2532" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A busy character screen in Honkai." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h6225"><a id=""></a>Jade</h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can fit into more teams than Firefly</li><li>Buffs teammate with skill that increases speed and offers coordinated attack</li><li>Ultimate that buffs follow-up attack</li><li>Follow-up attack raises Crit DMG</li><li>Skill point friendly</li></ul><p>Jade might not be able to defeat loads of enemies on her own, but adding her to a well-equipped team can make taking down waves of foes easier than without. She fills an entirely different role than Firefly as a sub DPS and enabler. Even though she’s an Erudition character (multi-target-focused), she has Harmony-like traits and self-buffing that gives her more utility than the average.<br></p><p>Jade’s Skill significantly increases the speed of your ally of choice and turns them into a “Debt Collector.” The Debt Collector benefits from a hefty speed boost and coordinated attacks while this buff is active. As this is happening, Jade collects stacks (similar to Adventurine) from each attack, which eventually triggers a heavy-hitting follow-up attack. She works best when paired with Erudition or follow-up-focused teammates that can help build her stacks.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Jade’s best teammates will be hard-hitting five-star characters like Blade or Argenti. Blade in particular works well because Jade can trigger his buffs with her Skill, which consumes HP from the target. Jingliu and Blade are one example of a popular pair that use the same mechanic. Jingliu eats Blade’s HP, which then triggers his heavy-hitting follow-up attack between turns. Jade fits a similar role for Blade.<br></p><p>Herta in particular is worth highlighting as a F2P teammate because she’s free, and you can earn her Eidolons from the Simulated Universe. Both Herta and Himeko benefit from Break Effect to trigger their follow-up attacks. Meanwhile, Argenti and Blade just do a lot of damage, but can be an expensive investment for newer players who don’t have enough resources to get them.<br></p><p>On the bright side, because Jade is a sub DPS or support, you might get more use out of her in the long run because she’ll fit into more teams. Many Erudition characters work well in double DPS teams that excel in clearing waves of enemies, and it’s just a matter of mix and matching depending on type weaknesses. In a Firefly team, Firefly is the star. She doesn’t have the means to support; her kit is mostly for her benefit rather than enabling others.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-recommend-id="image://f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->miHoYo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-recommend-id="image://f3b4f8ed386bd5082775e08b1ab73883" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jumpy fighty blade-wielding action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h6226"><a id=""></a>Who is better: Firefly or Jade?</h2><p>If you can only pull for one, I’d suggest going for <strong>Firefly</strong>. She can deal much more damage on her own, and can break Toughness on virtually any enemy. She doesn’t need other DPSes to enable her, and her best teammate is a free one that you’ve technically had since the beginning (therefore, have probably already raised). Firefly also has a lot of built in utility, like recharging her own Ultimate and implanting Fire weaknesses to enable her Break Effect abilities. While strong, Jade works best as part of a double DPS comp and still doesn’t offer as much utility as Firefly. </p><p>Again, this is just based on damage and investment. Jade is still a good choice if you don’t particularly want Firefly. I’d argue that you should still pull for Ruan Mei over her, but that’s besides the point. For a new player, Firefly is better value because her best teammates are easy to get. Therefore, investments will be cheaper. Jade requires other strong characters around her to be strong herself. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are a few caveats to accessing the downloadable content, however, but we'll explain all of those here.</p><p>Preloading is now available for Shadow of the Erdtree, meaning those who've already purchased it digitally can download it so it's ready in time for launch. Those who've done so can access the DLC at the following times.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Global Release Times</h2><h3>PC</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Pacific U.S. - June 20 at 3pm</li><li>Central U.S. - June 20 at 5pm</li><li>Columbia - June 20 at 5pm</li><li>Eastern U.S. - June 20 at 6pm</li><li>Brazil - June 20 at 7pm</li><li>UK - June 20 at 11pm</li><li>Central Europe - June 20 at midnight</li><li>South Africa - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Eastern Europe - June 21 at 1am</li><li>Moscow - June 21 at 1am</li><li>Qatar - June 21 at 1am</li><li>Gulf - June 21 at 2am</li><li>Singapore - June 21 at 6am</li><li>South Korea - June 21 at 7am</li><li>Japan - June 21 at 7am</li><li>Eastern Australia - June 21 at 8am</li><li>New Zealand - June 21 at 10am</li></ul><h3>PlayStation and Xbox</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Pacific U.S. - June 20 at 9pm</li><li>Central U.S. - June 20 at 11pm</li><li>Eastern U.S. - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Columbia - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Brazil - June 20 at midnight</li><li>UK - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Central Europe - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Eastern Europe - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Moscow - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Qatar - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Gulf - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Singapore - June 20 at midnight</li><li>South Korea - June 20 at 7am</li><li>Japan - June 20 at midnight</li><li>Eastern Australia - June 20 at midnight</li><li>New Zealand - June 20 at midnight</li></ul><p>As for actually playing the DLC, players should use the final few hours before its launch to make sure they're caught up and ready to go.

"It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Funcom [76 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> has released a new set of trailers and screenshots for <a title="Genres > Open-World [434 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> survival <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [40 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">massively multiplayer online game</a> <em><a title="Games > Dune: Awakening [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a></em> as part of the game’s second <em>Dune: Awakening</em> Direct showcase. <span id="more-894315"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The showcase offers 30 minutes of in-depth interviews and game footage showing character creation, the MMO-like server structure, the narrative ramifications of a world where Paul Atreides was never born, and the spiritual journey the player will undergo in the game, following in the footsteps of the Fremen.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em>, which recently shot past one million wishlists on Steam, draws on the visual and aural identity created by Denis Villeneuve and Legendary’s recent blockbuster movies and is deeply rooted in the original masterpiece by Frank Herbert. The game unleashes you on a vast and open Arrakis torn by war, where you must survive and strive for control of the spice alongside hundreds of other players.</p><p>Premiered at Summer Game Fest, the story cinematic—<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/dune-awakening-the-vision-of-paul-atreides-cinematic-trailer">The Vision of Paul Atreides</a>—revealed the alternate timeline that Jessica Atreides creates by choosing to give birth to a daughter instead of Paul, beginning a cascading chain of events. Paul’s absence leads to a huge power vacuum into which players will venture, creating their own story.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_894305"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>“Expression and customization” is one of the core pillars of <em>Dune: Awakening</em>. To showcase a part of that, the Direct shows off the robust in-game character creation tool. Choose every detail of your appearance, then your home planet, and even your mentor’s specialization, such as Mentat, Swordmaster, or Bene Gesserit, which determines your starting abilities.</p><p>Creative director Joel Bylos also dived into the server structure and the Overland Map, which connects various massive sandbox maps, allowing for a larger number of players in each, both of which set <em>Dune: Awakening</em> apart from many other <a title="Genres > Survival [292 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival games</a>.</p><p>“Making the world feel seamless and connected has always been one of our goals on <em>Dune: Awakening</em>,” said creative director Joel Bylos. “We built this structure with the idea of making the game expandable, which is difficult with a single map. The idea with the overland map is that it allows us to just keep building the world and giving players new spaces to explore. Who knows what it will look like five years from now?”</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> has recently entered its persistent closed Beta, giving access to the full breadth of the game, from the Hagga Basin starting area to the Deep Desert endgame. Sign up for a chance to join on the official website, and wishlist the game on Steam.</p><p>With Gamescom coming up in August, Funcom now prepares for an epic Dune: Awakening gameplay reveal.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,336 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Super Evil Megacorp has announced that their roguelite turtle game, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</em>, is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Switch</a> on July 17. It was <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously available</a> for iOS via Apple Arcade and is now coming to a more thumb-friendly platform.</p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">I don’t like touching my phone, so I don’t have any experience with <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</em>. It’s a top-down fighting game that looks pretty hack and slashy. There are dashes that probably have invincibility frames. It looks very <em>Hades-like</em>, but there’s co-op. There <em>has</em> to be co-op. It would be an affront to good taste if a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> game didn’t have co-op. We’re not on the NES and Game Boy anymore.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIaR93sOHRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><em>Splintered Fate</em> is said to feature “an all-new story written by legendary comic book author Tom Waltz and Kevin Michael Johnson.” The roguelite angle seems strange to me because I’m pretty sure the turtles are married to their weapons, but apparently, there is a “diverse build system” that allows you to&nbsp; “create the elemental-infused Teenage Turtle of their dreams.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">I’ve never dreamed of infusing a Teenage Turtle with elements, but I get what they’re saying.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">It also touts that it has received “over 22,000 5/5 radical player reviews,” which doesn’t mean much to me. Especially since the app store on my phone only says 1K ratings. Still, I looked up reviews and they’re pretty positive, if maybe not enthusiastic. Still, if you’re into ‘90s-locked turtle ‘tude, it may be worth checking out.</p>
 <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="84" data-injectable="false"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</em> launches on Switch July 17 for $29.99.</p>

		<p>The classic (depending on your point of view) Marvel vs Capcom fighting games are return in one collection, backed up with a couple of Marvel only titles. The ridiculously named MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is coming to coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Steam later this year. You will note that Xbox players are left out, and there’s no specific PS5 version either.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLS4-W4Yq84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The games are:</p>
<p>– X-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM<br>
– MARVEL SUPER HEROES<br>
– X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER<br>
– MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER<br>
– MARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES<br>
– MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes<br>
– THE PUNISHER</p>

<p>As usual there are a bunch of enhancements for the games including custom matches, spectator features, museum, music player, various display filters, one-button special moves and the ability to save and load the game at any point you wish. “Rollback netcode will make online battles even smother”, add <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/capcom/">Capcom.</a> The game will not have cross play support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing.906825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom released its second <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-qa-creative-director-clarifies-mmo-size-hints-at-beyond-arrakis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> Direct, where Game Director Joel Bylos revealed more details of the upcoming survival MMO.</p>
<p>To start with, we learned that following the previous limited Closed Beta events, Dune: Awakening has recently entered the persistent Closed Beta phase, which is obviously a step toward the full release, allowing testers to check out the whole game. There's still no word on the launch, although Funcom has already promised an 'epic' gameplay reveal at Gamescom, and that might be the venue for such announcements.</p>
<p>Throughout the Dune: Awakening Direct, the studio showed the character creation tool, where players choose not only how their character looks but also their background, including their mentor's specialization, such as Mentat, Bene Gesserit, Trooper, and Swordmaster.</p>
<p>However, the juiciest part of the video was the overview of the world structure. Funcom explained that there is a top-down Overland map connecting the various huge maps, one of which supports hundreds of players at once. This choice allows the studio to expand the game more easily in the future with additional playable spaces than it could have with a single map. If you're interested in the full breakdown of how the MMO component of Dune: Awakening works, here's the excerpt from Bylos.</p>
<p><em>When players start to play Dune: Awakening, they choose a world. It's almost like choosing a server in an MMORPG, but it's a large infrastructure of connected servers. The idea is that as a player, you choose, you join, you start in a map, and from there, your experience should be relatively seamless in terms of how you explore and feel the world.</em></p>
<p><em>The reason we call it a survival MMO, as opposed to just a survival game, is that most survival games do one map, one server. But we have multiple connected servers running in a single world, and it also allows us to have a lot more players in this structure.</em></p>
<p><em>When you join the game, you start in the Hagga Basin map, which has a server with a minimum of 40 other players. It's a place where you can build, craft, survive, progress. If you want to play specifically with friends, you want to join the same version of Hagga Basin because it can have multiple versions. And then from there, you move outwards. </em></p>
<p><em>I can select which Hagga Basin I'm starting with. So if we start in Dune: Awakening at the same time, I can make sure that we're spawning in the same. Not only that, our server browser also tells you where your friends are playing. </em><em>Once you're ready to leave the Hagga Basin, you craft yourself an ornithopter and you fly out into what's called the Overland map, which allows you to see all the locations in the world. You physically fly between locations on the Overland map.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_OverlandMap_Infographic.gif"></a></figure>

<p><em>One of those options are the social hubs, Harko Village and Arrakeen, which are differently themed based on the different factions in the game. These are safe spaces, peaceful by the Canley Peace. There are bars, vendors, and home exchanges.&nbsp;And of course, you and your friends can go dancing in the clubs.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Then you'll go back to the Overland map and you'll fly to the Deep Desert. The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>

<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-will-be-released-when-its-ready-as-funcom-wants-to-reduce-its-famous-jank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of a release window,</a> Dune: Awakening remains on our radar as one of the most promising multiplayer games. It will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though we don't know yet if it'll support cross-play.</p>

Meanwhile, watching from my desktop is Mustard, my new digital pet. He’s from a different game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/weyrdlets&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/weyrdlets"><em>Weyrdlets</em></a></span>, and he’s hanging out with me as I work and play games on my PC. After killing some guards in <em>Selaco</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>I make sure to pet Mustard before reloading and getting back into the mayhem. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196539" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="278" data-playlist="196539,193379,191355" data-current="196539"><div><p>This Innovative Hades-Like Feels Built For Speedrunners</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196539/196539_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22094.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Mustard, a little pink lizard-like creature I created and named, is a good companion.  I wanted to know more about how he came to be and what it’s like making an indie game in 2024. So I spoke to Weyrdworks, the devs behind <em>Weyrdlets</em>, to find out how this game works and how you break through among all the other new games launching on Steam every day.</p><p>“<em>Weyrdlets </em>is a cozy virtual pet game centered around a community and a simulated virtual world of colorful characters,” explained game director Shawn Beck. “There aren’t any real objectives or goals to achieve. It’s all about caring for a pet in a wholesome community of friends. Think of it as a desktop companion that’s also an idle game.”</p><p>According to the game’s art director, JT Yean, <em>Weyderlets</em> was inspired by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a></span>, a game that is also mostly about vibes and chilling with cute critters. Yean says that Weyrdlets is meant to “fade into the background” as you do other things on your PC. </p><p>“Think Microsoft Clippy, but better,” adds social media specialist Wing Yee. </p><h2 id="h7763"><a id=""></a>A little digital friend on your big screen</h2><p>While you can play <em>Weyderlets </em>like any other game—with it taking over your screen as you help build a new home for your pet, train them, and play with them—the coolest feature of this virtual pet sim is when you free your buddy and let them run around on your desktop as you do other things. </p><p>According to Beck, the team had wanted to make a virtual pet game for some time but didn’t have a “hook” for it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-fan-game-unleashes-havoc-on-your-desktop-1841351806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-fan-game-unleashes-havoc-on-your-desktop-1841351806"><em>Desktop Goose</em> and other games</a></span> that put characters on your desktop helped guide the team. </p><p>“It’s not a new concept, for sure,” said Beck. “But we’ve tried a lot of other desktop pet games, and they were more toys than games. It just seemed like there was more to explore.”<br></p><p>The team says balancing the virtual pet on your desktop was tricky. The cute pet needs to require some of your attention, you’ll sometimes need to feed it or pet it, but they always had to make sure your cute critter never felt annoying. </p><p>How this all works, according to the devs, is that <em>Weyrdlets </em>is running on screen with a transparent background. So you can see and interact with your desktop as your virtual pet runs around and demands food. In my time with <em>Weyrdlets</em>, I’ve never been annoyed by Mustard, even when he would wander in front of my emails. And I was always able to get work done, watch videos, or play other games, too. </p><h2 id="h7764"><a id=""></a>Getting people to play your new game in 2024</h2><p>Of course, in 2024, even a cute virtual pet game inspired by <em>Animal Crossing</em> might struggle to find an audience. I asked the team if they were concerned about being buried by all the other <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/steam-breaks-another-annual-record-launching-more-than-14000-games-in-2023/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/steam-breaks-another-annual-record-launching-more-than-14000-games-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big and small releases that seemingly launch every day on Steam</a></span>. </p><p>“We’re worried all the time,” admitted Beck. “Really, all we can do is put our best foot forward and build something focused on bringing value to our players. Though I hope being in a niche space of virtual pets will help separate us from the noise.”</p><figure id="" data-id="4edd54d99b5f18892d46edd0eabc9163" data-recommend-id="image://4edd54d99b5f18892d46edd0eabc9163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="914" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone playing Weyrdlets.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for tips for other devs out there who hope to make something good that people actually find and play, Yean advised teams to “always share your work,” and get as much feedback as possible. “Player feedback has been immensely valuable to us,” added Beck.<br></p><p>“It’s also nice to be able to include the community in the credits,” said Yee. “I wish more games did this. I’m still new to the games industry, but being involved in the development of a game is really exciting, whether you’re on the dev team or cheering from the sidelines.”<br></p><p>Assuming Weyrdworks is able to get people playing and enjoying its desktop pet sim, the team has big plans for the future, including a soccer mode and more. </p><p>“<em>Weyrdlets </em>is a continuously evolving game, meaning it will continue to receive updates, events, minigames, and other exciting features even after launch,” said Yee. “The fun never stops.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Weyrdlets </em>launches on July 23</a></span>.

<p>PC gamers of a certain vintage will remember tales of <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">Project Van Buren</a>, a title that early '00s Interplay intended as the sequel to 1998's hit <em>Fallout 2</em>. Now, original <em>Fallout</em> producer Timothy Cain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag">is sharing some behind-the-scenes details</a> about how he contributed to the project's cancellation during a particularly difficult time for publisher Interplay.</p>
<p>Cain famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfaCXEu0tE&amp;t=0s">left Interplay during <em>Fallout 2</em>'s development</a> in the late '90s to help form <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2005/02/games-20050219/">short-lived</a> RPG house <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q3/arcanum/arcanum.html">Troika Games</a>. After his departure, though, he was still in touch with some people from his former employer, including an unnamed Interplay vice president looking for some outside opinions on the troubled Van Buren project.</p>
<p>"Would you mind coming over and playing one of my game prototypes?" Cain recalls this vice president asking him sometime in mid-2003. "We're making a <em>Fallout</em> game and I'm going to have to cancel it. I don't think they can get it done... but if you could come over and look at it and give me an estimate, there's a chance I wouldn't cancel it."</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwoWRj0cfag?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Cain discusses his memories of testing "Project Van Buren."</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cain recalls walking "across the street" from Troika to the Interplay offices, motivated to help because, as he remembers it, "if you don't do it, bad things will happen to other people." There, he got to see the latest build of Project Van Buren, running on <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jefferson_Engine">the 3D Jefferson Engine</a> that was intended to replace the sprite-based isometric view of the first two <em>Fallout</em> games. Cain said the version he played was similar or identical to <a href="https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/van-burens-technical-demo.71/history">a tech demo obtained by fan site No Mutants Allowed in 2007</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD-LCsIiw2g&amp;t=0s">featured in a recent YouTube documentary</a> about the failed project.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>After playing for about two hours and talking to the team behind the project, Cain said the VP asked him directly how long the demo needed to become a shippable game. The answer Cain reportedly gave—18 months of standard development for "a really good game" or 12 months of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/05/the-death-march-the-problem-of-crunch-time-in-game-development/">"death march" crunch time</a> for an unbalanced, buggy mess—was too long for the financially strapped publisher to devote to funding the project.
</p><p>"He could not afford a development period of more than six months," Cain said. "To me, that time frame was out of the question... He thought it couldn't be done in six months; I just confirmed that."</p>
<h2>Show me the money</h2>
<p>Looking back today, Cain said it's hard to pinpoint a single "villain" responsible for Van Buren's failure. Even reusing the engine from the first <em>Fallout</em> game—as the <em>Fallout 2</em> team did for that title's quick 12-month development process—wouldn't have necessarily helped, Cain said. "Would that engine have been acceptable five years later [after <em>Fallout 2</em>]?" he asked rhetorically. "Had anyone really looked at it? I started the engine in 1994... it's creaky."</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DD-LCsIiw2g?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Real "Van Buren"-heads will enjoy this in-depth look at the game's development, including details of Interplay's troubled financial situation in the early '00s.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end, Van Buren's cancellation (and that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/04/interplays-fallout-mmo-may-not-see-light-of-day/">a planned Interplay <em>Fallout</em> MMO</a> years later) simply "comes down to money," Cain said. "I do not believe that [with] the money they had left, the game in the state it was in, and the people who were working on it could have completed it within six months," he said. "And [if they did], I don't think it would have been a game you would have liked playing."
</p><p>Luckily, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/interplay-offices-closed-by-state-officials/1100-6100019/">all-but-name shuttering of Interplay</a> in the years after Van Buren's cancellation wouldn't spell the end of the <em>Fallout</em> series. Bethesda <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/bethesda-obtains-fallout-ip/">acquired the license in 2007</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/fallout-3-review/">a completely reimagined <em>Fallout 3</em></a> that has become the cornerstone of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">a fan-favorite franchise</a> many years later. But for those still wondering what Interplay's original "Fallout 3" could have been, a group of fans is <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">trying to rebuild the Project Van Buren demo from the ground up</a> for modern audiences.</p>

<section><p>Dune: Awakening looks to have a huge game map, and as you search for scarce resources, you'll potentially have to fight other players to claim them.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We've heard a lot about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-dune-awakening-youll-fight-to-survive-sandworms-political-machinations-and-other-players/1100-6521543/" data-ref-id="1100-6521543">survival aspect</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>--such as the way you'll need to conserve water, stay out of the baking Arrakis sun, and carefully avoid ever-present sandworms. While it seems that staying alive on the least hospitable planet in the universe will take up a lot of your attention, the other part of Dune: Awakening is a slate of MMO elements, including the way you'll tangle with other players who are also doing their best to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Fancom gave a hands-off demonstration of Dune: Awakening during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, giving a quick new look at the survival MMO and particularly showing off a bit of its moment-to-moment gameplay. While we didn't get to play the game ourselves, we did see it <em>being</em> played, which gave a sense of the fact that while you're completing quests and keeping yourself alive, there will be times when you've got to contend with other players who might want what you have.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo picked up right after the player had cleared out an underground ecology lab, one of the locations that serves as Dune: Awakening's equivalent to a dungeon. We were told that this character was in about the midgame, around 60 hours in, having gone beyond basic survival to gather and craft elements like a suspensor belt--a special bit of levitation technology that allowed them to make very high jumps and to float down from high locations unscathed--and an ornithopter, a flying vehicle for getting around. Leaving the dungeon, the player jumped right into their ornithopter, lifted it up, and transitioned out of the dungeon and out into the desert at large.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the Hagga Basin, which looks like it'll be a main focus of much of Dune: Awakening, at least early on. As social and economic director Matt Woodward explained during the demo, the location supports around 40 players in an instance, and is made up of a variety of different locations. There are places like the lab, expanses of desert, and villages or outposts you can visit. The ornithopter did a pass over a few different parts of the location, including the open desert, where we landed for a quick look around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321239"></a><figcaption>Ornithopters are a good way to get around the desert without attracting sandworm attention, but everything else is vulnerable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321239-duneornithoptercombat.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Frank Herbert's novel, the desert isn't uniform--the sand can sometimes compress to conduct sound extremely well, known as drum sand, and we also saw a bubbling area where subsurface liquid created quicksand. The player used the suspensor belt to jump free of the quicksand before sinking, but as all Dune fans know, messing around with that technology attracts the worm--which showed up a few seconds later. It was back to the ornithopter to avoid being eaten. Sandworms are a big hazard in Dune: Awakening, because while you retain your gear if you're killed by other means, anything on you when you're eaten by a sandworm (along with vehicles or anything else that gets consumed) is gone forever.</p><p dir="ltr">Next, the demo took us to a non-combat zone: a Harkonnen base. In this playthrough, the player had sided with the Harkonnen faction, making them allies to the great house but enemies with anyone loyal to the Atreides, the house of Dune's usual protagonists. The base, Woodward said, was created using the same building system that Dune: Awakening makes available to characters, with only a few developer-specific pieces. The gist is that you'll be able to construct your own bases and dwellings at the same level of quality as the developers, if you want.</p><p dir="ltr">The Harkonnen base was a spot where the player could pick up quests or talk to NPCs if they wanted to. This is also the kind of place where you can talk to trainer characters who can unlock new abilities for your character. You choose a role at the start of the game, like being a human computer called a Mentat, a swordmaster, or a Bene Gesserit who can deploy special abilities like the mind-controlling Voice. But you're not limited to just the abilities and skill trees you get when you choose your starting conditions. In the Harkonnen base, the demo showed us the Mentat trainer, who can help you start unlocking Mentat abilities for your character so you can mix and match how you play.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaving the Harkonnen base by grabbing another vehicle, a land-based buggy, we headed to a new location: a crashed spaceship. The ship had smashed through the surface of Arrakis and was located deep in a gorge. It was full of valuable stuff, so the Harkonnens and the Atreides had each set up a base at one end of the gorge, hoping to protect the wreck itself from the other faction. That had resulted in something of a stalemate between the two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321240"></a><figcaption>Which social spaces you can enter, like Harko Village, is determined by your faction alignment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321240-da_harkovillage.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The gorge was a good demonstration of the way locations are laid out in Dune: Awakening. The Harkonnen base is a non-combat area, essentially a social location. Outside of it, in the gorge, is a "Limited Warfare" area, which consists of PvE gameplay, where you'll take down enemy soldiers and NPCs. The shipwreck itself, however, is a "War of Assassins" area, named after the larger conflict between the Atreides and the Harkonnen--a full PvP zone.</p><p dir="ltr">The reason for that is because the shipwreck contains valuable, one-of-a-kind schematics you can use to create new gear. Venturing into the ship, your goal is to find that schematic and leave with it. In this case, it allowed the crafting of a new, powerful rifle, but since there's only one schematic in the shipwreck at a time, in order to liberate it for yourself, you'll have to deal with anyone else who's also trying to take it. The demo obviously didn't have anyone else contending for that schematic, but in the live game, heading into locations like this will be a risk.</p><p dir="ltr">Woodward explained that, when you get the schematic out of the ship and can craft the item, you'll get precisely one of them. If you want another rifle, you'll have to repeat the process of finding the schematic and getting it home safely. That gives you some economic power, though, allowing you to sell the schematic or the rifle to other players and charging the kind of price that a tough-to-get item like that should command.</p><p>The playthrough of the demo ended after leaving the crashed ship, but Woodward gave a little more context of just how large we can expect Dune: Awakening to be. The Hagga Basin, he said, is comparable to the size of Conan: Exile's map, about 64 square kilometers. Dune: Awakening will also have social locations like the capital city of Arrakeen, and the Harkonnen town Harko Village. Leaving the Hagga Basin by ornithopter takes you to an overworld map that lets you travel between major locales.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321241" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321241"></a><figcaption>The overworld map allows you to move between different major locations, like Hagga Basin and the deep desert.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4321241-da_overlandmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And then there's the deep desert--the high-level PvP area where you're seemingly going to put a lot of effort. Forming groups and guilds, you'll head into the deep desert to harvest spice, search labs, and find wrecked ships, among other things. Just like in the wrecked ship, you'll potentially fight other players as you try to claim unique schematics in the deep desert each week. Woodward said that the deep desert is the size of three of the 8-kilometer by 8-kilometer Hagga Basin map. Each week, a Coriolis Storm will reset the whole area, so not only are you going to be revisiting it over and over, but it's going to be a huge area that will take a while to explore after each sweep.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the demo only lasted a few minutes, it still gave an interesting new take on Dune: Awakening, and in particular, how the game's survival and MMO elements are going to work and meld together. There's still a lot of the game we need to see in action, and the demo only gave quick looks at things like actually exploring and interacting with the desert, or engaging in combat--which seems like it can be pretty different from one player to the next, depending on what path you decide to take. But the ideas of questing, surviving, and fighting other players for cool, finite resources all sound like intense and fun additions to Dune: Awakening and great uses of the Dune setting. We'll have to keep waiting to see even more, but what Funcom has shown so far looks promising.</p>

Before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I was at Valve for sixteen years where I wore a plethora of hats and worked on games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Left 4 Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Portal 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Counter-Strike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In 2019, I decided to strike it out on my own and founded Double Dagger Studio. A handful of years later, we launched our first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> hasn’t been out very long but already has quite a bit of buzz around it! Your promotional game is top-notch. Would you care to pass along some tips?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I am a big believer in creating things with the intention to sell them. That means thinking about the marketability and brand early on in the development process. Asking yourself things like, “what is interesting about this game that people will be attracted to?” and “how can I visually present the brand in a way that will catch people's eyes and stand out in a group of others?” That way, it makes it a lot easier when the time comes to put eyeballs in front of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are a lot of very simple tricks to get people to look at your game (that honestly, I think people should be using more). One is just always having a full frame face somewhere on your branding. People are naturally attracted to faces and eyes. In my case, I guess it doesn't hurt that it's a cute little kitty, haha. But I remember reading articles where a group tracked peoples eyes as they scanned a website or a magazine, and they were always attracted to the faces first. And if I can use that trick to get their attention, well then the hard part comes and I have to keep it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For promoting the game, I mostly stuck to one platform, Twitter. It fit my style and my schedule to just throw things up there on a whim as I was working on them without thinking about it too much. The other social media sites require a lot more time, effort, and planning, and since I’m also making the game, this wasn’t really a good use of my time, in my opinion!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But later in the project, I was able to work with the wonderful folks at popagenda who helped me get so many more media opportunities. And then I was able to hire a great social media person, Shan Moran. I really wanted a social media person who could not only make the posts, but make cartoons and art for them as well. Shan was perfect for this.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It’s tempting to compare </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> with the other big cat game, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stray</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, but really other than featuring a cat the two have little in common. The gameplay is particularly refreshing: there is no health meter, no dangers, no lives and in fact no fail state. Do you think you have trouble engaging the player when there’s no “stakes?”</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Keeping the player engaged was certainly a concern of mine. My experience in engaging the player in the past was partly through conflict and partly through puzzle design. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does have a few light puzzles, there is no heavy conflict so this was brand new territory for me as a designer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This also brings up a point that I stumbled on about halfway through development. I find that when I play RPGs, I never do the main quests and just meander around letting myself get distracted by all the side quests and activities. Exploring and doing everything but the thing I'm supposed to be doing is what makes me happy. I guess it's no wonder then that I got diagnosed with Inattentive Type ADHD last year at the age of 47.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So anyway….this is how I ended up iteratively designing the structure of the game, and once I realized what was forming, it became obvious. The game was a game about distractions. I made the main quest fairly easy to achieve, but we encourage the player to feel free to just go explore over there or get distracted by that thing without worrying about time or pressure or nagging. Just go meander and have fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To follow up from that, there not being any way you can harm the cat helps make the game feel much more like a playground. That, and the light jazz soundtrack, give the experience a joyful and playful feeling, which is essential in allowing the player the freedom to try things out without risking danger. Did the lack of overt danger limit the design, was it always planned that way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So actually, I knew I wanted to make a “chill” game, but my first instinct and the first prototype was a survival-like game. The idea being that you actually needed to survive on the street, you needed food and water, and there was a day cycle. I played with that for a bit before I realized I had strayed too far from my original goals, and it wasn’t something I could make interesting without forcing the kitty to struggle and eventually fail. The more I thought about it and the more I explained it to my family and friends, the more I realized that seeing a little kitty struggle, fail, or get hurt was not something people would want to experience. So I pivoted. Then it was just a matter of figuring out what you did in the game if there was no fail state or conflicts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I knew from the start that I wanted to make a game that I could play with my kids. I had my goals, which were to encourage exploration, don't hurt Kitty, and encourage curiosity and discovery. And I had some ideas, but since this was mostly new territory for me, I looked towards some other great games that had no-conflict fun. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, aspects of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, parts of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and a slew of PC indie games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Short Hike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pikuniku</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slime Rancher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, all the Sokpop games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Donut County</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">….I could go on, but all of these ended up being great inspirations for me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The jazz soundtrack felt like an obvious choice. Cats have always had an association with jazz, and the composer, Riley Koenig, took all my crazy, disconnected inspirations and created the perfect, playful soundtrack for the game.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another game that seems an inspiration is </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>: not only is playful mischief possible, prevalent and prominent, but the faceless human characters seems like they might even be Japanese counterparts to the English/Australian villagers of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, just another town in the same world. Is this intentional, and how does not depicting human faces help in characterizing them?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I think most cat owners can relate to sometimes feeling like the cat is the one really in charge, and we’re just here to provide food, shelter, and attention. I wanted to bring that perspective, which is why the human characters are fairly simple and don’t have faces. To cats, humans are just moving objects in the background. And when you give something a face, people tend to empathize with that thing more and I didn't want players to associate more with the humans than the animals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From an artistic perspective, the more detailed an object is, the more attention a player is going to give it. Since the humans are just “moving objects”, it made sense to keep their models simple and similar to the environment as opposed to the animal characters which are much more detailed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Open world games seem difficult to make with small teams. To make a</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> or </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, Nintendo has hundreds of people to create terrain for them. Even though the scope of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> is much smaller, it seems challenging. How’d you do it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I made a lot of mistakes along the way, haha. But in the end, we focused on adding a lot of density and verticality to the map. Even if the player has explored everything at street level, there’s still more to find when they look behind fences or climb a terrace. We also took inspiration from metroidvanias and created areas that were clearly exploreable but players wouldn’t be able to reach until they had progressed further in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I found the cat’s animation to be very well-observed, and it abounds in little details, like how their ears fold back when running, or how they squeeze through low passages. I’ve also noticed that they control kind of like a train: they have a front and back half that are connected, and the caboose follows the engine, so to speak. I don’t know how accurate this observation is, but I thought it was interesting that they seemed to control this way. Are there any insights you can offer for kitty animation?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We watched a LOT of cat videos. Truly so much credit goes to Micah Breitweiser, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/deep-dive-how-little-kitty-big-city-rejects-realism-to-achieve-authenticity">who added a lot of those small details to our characters</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">! She has an amazing understanding of both how cats communicate through body language and how to translate those movements into animation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the movement and a few other things are a combination of hand made animation and dynamic real time bone movement in the game. Cats move in smooth curves, and it was difficult to get that and have it work dynamically in all situations, so I decided the procedural combo was the best solution.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World navigation was for the most part simple and intuitive: you hold the jump button down, and the game displays its arc and destination, which can then be adjusted. I don’t know if other games have done this before, but I think it’s a key aspect of the play: controlling the kitty could have been so much more difficult without it. Did you plan to have the cat control that way from the start?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The arc jump or what I call “the precision jump” was implemented very early on, but it was much simpler than what we shipped with. I wanted the game to feel relaxed, so taking the time to line up every jump seemed like a good idea. But once I implemented the first version and had people play it, it was painfully slow, and players begged for a faster way to jump around. So I implemented the quick version of that, which under the hood is almost exactly the same jump, it just does all of the targeting invisibly for you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't know if any other games that do this either. It was just a thing that seemed to make sense to me, imagining a cat ready to pounce and then springing to their destination.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Progress is gated by finding fish, which can be thought of as a tasty version of the Shrine Orbs in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> that increase stamina. In the </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> games they’re much more helpful than necessary, but </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> seems like it was designed so that all the fish are needed. Do you think a speedrunner will find a way to bust the design wide open?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Oh absolutely. The speedrunners have already beat the game sub 30 seconds with no fish. It's crazy! Technically, without using advanced strats or glitching, you can make it home with just three fish. Originally I was going to let you get home with just one and have the other fish more for doing side quests, but we really wanted most people to experience the joy of stealing a fish from someone.</span></p><p>Image via Double Dagger Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>&nbsp;Finally, I support the decision completely, but why is the game set in a Japanese city in particular? Does it just seem like a good place for a kitty to explore?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The first time I visited Japan, I kind of fell in love with the cities and towns. I also have this problem where I can't convince myself to deep dive into a topic unless I can also convince myself it's “useful” in some way (it's a curse). So since I really wanted to research and explore Japanese-style urban design, it became the perfect excuse to set the game in Japan, haha. That's only partly the reason of course. I also have a strong association in my mind between cats and Tokyo streets. That and being fans of Japanese cat media like Chi’s Sweet Home, Cat Beginner and a manga from the '80s called What’s Michael, it just made sense.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and "fish," whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="331" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Two years after its debut, FromSoftware’s latest<em> Elden Ring </em>patch makes one of its most infuriating encounters a bit easier. Said boss always made a brilliant first impression, then quickly fumbles its introduction with a nasty second phase that has players hoofin’ it — quite literally, after today’s update. </p> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="93" data-injectable="false"><strong>Spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn’t experienced <em>Elden Ring’s </em>base-game content. </strong></p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true"><em>Elden Ring’s</em> final boss, Radagon of the Golden Order, is an incredible fight. The score swells, the one-on-one combat shines, and the spectacle of his attacks dazzle. Then, a second phase comes along and sours the whole affair: the Elden Beast. Well, starting today, that wet blanket of a fight is going to be a lot more bearable as the Tarnished’s trusty companion rushes to the rescue. </p>
 <h2 id="h-torrent-dashes-into-the-elden-beast-arena" data-injectable="false">Torrent dashes into the Elden Beast arena</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bandai Namco YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Torrent, the spectral steed who carried us all across the Lands Between, can now be summoned to help players fight the Elden Beast as of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today’s pre-DLC patch. </a> Why is this important? Well, mostly because the entire Elden Beast fight <em>seems</em> to have been designed with Torrent in mind from the start.</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">The Elden Beast loves, and I mean just <em>adores</em> wasting the player’s time by flying the length of the arena away every four to five seconds. Prior to today’s patch, you spent most of this encounter simply running after the thing, dodging its merciless ranged attacks before reaching it, doing one or two hits of damage, and repeating the process. Not anymore. </p> <h2 id="h-hitless-runs-got-easier-too" data-injectable="false">Hitless runs got easier, too</h2> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="false">Further helped by this addition is “hitless” runs: self-imposed challenges where players attempt the entire game without taking so much as a papercut’s worth of damage. Elden Stars, an attack used by the boss, features aggressive homing missiles that are nearly impossible for a player to dodge on foot. The hope is with the addition of Torrent, this attack that cut runs down mere inches from the finish line will be much more reliably avoided. </p>

<p data-characters="112" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">EA gave players a first look at new features coming to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/madden-25-2024-release-window-platforms-and-more/">Madden 25</a></em>, including what to expect from Superstar mode. </p> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">EA confirmed that players can transition their Road to Glory character from <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> into <em>Madden 25</em> Superstar mode. It’s been 10 years since players could use this feature in <em>NCAA College Football 14 </em>before the series went on a lengthy hiatus. The ability to pay athletes opened the door for EA to revive the franchise, and now football fans will have the exciting opportunity to take a created avatar through all four years of college and then under the bright lights of the NFL. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="832" data-injectable="true">If players want to take advantage of the transition feature, the $150 MVP bundle includes Deluxe Editions of <em>Madden 25</em> and <em>College Football 25</em>. In comparison, purchasing the Deluxe Editions separately costs $200, so if you already planned on getting both titles, you can save $50. <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> launches on July 19, while Madden 25 hits shelves on August 16. This gives players just under a month to get a head start on their Road to Glory Journey, which should be plenty of time to knock out a few college seasons. </p>
 <p data-characters="633" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><em>Madden 25</em> Superstar mode features new NFL Draft Combine drills so players can show off their EA Sports College Football 25 avatar’s skills and improve their draft stock. Based on your avatar’s Combine performance and college career stats, they will be drafted by an NFL team between the first and seventh rounds. EA also implemented a new Superstar quest system that challenges players to improve their relationship with the media, coach, and teammates. In addition, there are new upgrades to Player Grading that revamp player progression and make the transition from being a rookie to a seasoned veteran more realistic. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Madden 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-5zgzEAeAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="172" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false">As for what players can expect from <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, the development team plans on revealing more information about the game mode closer to the release date. </p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Grimdark fantasy sounds like a pretty niche genre until you take a little look behind its musty curtain to see all the books and incredibly dark worlds lurking there. While many of the places in this genre feel impossibly bleak, the stories you’ll read are often far from it.</p> <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">I always thought grimdark fantasy was restricted to the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40K</a></em> universe, but there’s so much more to it than the <em>Black Library</em>. High fantasy and low fantasy settings can each easily slot into the genre, and you’d be surprised by what you’ve already read that’s considered part of it. If the world is harsh and the people in it have very little joy or things to look forward to, you’re reading grimdark fantasy, but the stories can give you hope and help you see there’s always a silver lining if you fight on.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-grimdark-fantasy-books-to-check-out-this-year" data-injectable="false">The best grimdark fantasy books to check out this year</h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Below, I’ve listed the best grimdark fantasy books you should read this year. It feels like the genre is gaining more of a presence as new TV shows adapt books from it or certain franchises grow in popularity across social media platforms. If you want to get into grimdark fantasy this year, these are the books I recommend you dive into. </p> <h3 id="h-15-a-game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/DGQuBEY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">15. A Game of Thrones: George R. R. Martin</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/DGQuBEY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Game of Thrones</a></em> is the first book in George R. R. Martin’s<em> A Song of Ice and Fire</em> epic. It introduces you to a bleak continent upon which everyone has experienced years of prosperous summer, but winter is coming. It follows several major and minor characters as a family is split up after an ominous sign leads to betrayal and the revelation that while dark forces are working in the world to bring it to its knees, even among the people, darkness is attempting to pull the kingdom down. </p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">This book is a fantastic opener to a series that spans a world with a grimdark history and sets up the epic stories that follow. From the princess of a dying house being sold as a bride to a lord being forced to question everything he knows about his best friend as he enters the royal court and finds that everyone is out for themselves, it’s worth reading for the scene about bending the knee at the very least, and that’s all I’ll leave you with. </p>
 <h3 id="h-14-gardens-of-the-moon-steven-erikson" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/nkNMCR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">14. Gardens of the Moon: Steven Erikson</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/nkNMCR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Gardens of the Moon</a></em> is a great grimdark fantasy novel with a wide scope that follows multiple characters in a world that’s constantly at war. The story opens years into a series of wars that see an empire attempting to conquer an entire continent. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">The main plot is gripping and explores just how dark this empire can be, even for those who are loyal to it. Even its subplot, which looks at this world’s gods and how they meddle with the world, is fascinating. It feels like a nice mix of folk tales from around the world and fantasy tropes, creating something unique and intriguing. </p> <h3 id="h-13-sharp-ends-joe-abercrombie" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/v9asd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">13. Sharp Ends: Joe Abercrombie</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/v9asd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sharp Ends</a></em> is a collection of short stories set in Joe Abercrombie’s world of <em>First Law</em>. While the main trilogy itself is a brilliant set of grimdark fantasy books to delve into, these short stories are easily digestible in small chunks, perfect for commutes or reading one per night if you want to experience self-contained grimdark stories. If you enjoy these stories, there’s so much more to explore. They’re a wonderful entry point to a world of despair. </p>
 <h3 id="h-12-where-loyalties-lie-rob-j-hayes" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/BY8hM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">12. Where Loyalties Lie: Rob J. Hayes</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="791" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/BY8hM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Where Loyalties Lie</a></em> is a grimdark fantasy pirate novel that does things a little differently. It’s told from the point of a ship’s perspective in a world where all the darkest parts of pirate tales are completely normal, making most characters fairly evil on a base level. However, as you get to know them and follow the two main characters on their journey to fight a common threat, goodness emerges, and the characters develop into something more than when you first met them. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">It’s a story that should be familiar. The empire of this world is raising it to the ground in the name of unity and wants to eradicate piracy in the most brutal way possible. Pirates, of course, hate this idea. So they band together to fight against something that’s managed to be somehow even worse than they are. </p> <h3 id="h-11-the-fifth-season-n-k-jemisin" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ZnyPY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">11. The Fifth Season: N.K. Jemisin</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/ZnyPY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Fifth Season</a></em> has a gripping premise for a grimdark fantasy book. A young woman’s family is murdered, as is most of the population of the empire, which spans the entire planet. As if that weren’t enough, someone has torn a giant red scar into the Earth, spewing out fire and gases, blotting out the sun. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true">Essun, the protagonist, now needs to navigate this grimdark world alone and scared. I think it’s a great way to present a high fantasy world that’s just been torn apart, treating an active grimdark fantasy world that might get better but is likely only to get worse. It’s rare to see fantasy explore post-apocalyptic themes like this, making it a nice crossover if you’ve been reading a lot of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-thriller-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi</a>. </p>
 <h3 id="h-10-the-grim-company-luke-scull" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/NbU6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">10. The Grim Company: Luke Scull</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/NbU6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>The Grim Company</em> </a>is a brilliant tale told in one of the darkest settings out there. The city of Dorminia is ruled over with an iron fist by its leader, and Mindhawks patrol the sky to seek out any heretical thoughts before they become something more. As you can imagine, rebellion is quite challenging. enter the plucky crew consisting of a barbarian, an assassin, and a young sorceress, all who want to free the city. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">While the story is quite self-contained here, the world in which it’s set serves to only make things feel even more grimdark. Magic power in this world is finite, and every nation is battling for control over it. I love the setting and think it’s a great juxtaposition for the tiny amount of hope our heroes seek to bring. </p> <h3 id="h-9-song-jesse-teller" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/6hsMPFr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">9.

 <p data-characters="572" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/6hsMPFr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Song</a></em> is a brutally grimdark fantasy book that acts as your entry to the <em>Manhunters</em> series. Some of the darkest minds in Perilisc attacked a prison called Manding Keep and unleashed its occupants on the world. Rayph puts together a band of Manhunters to track them down, but someone’s also out for his blood from the shadows. Who knows if they’ll be able to prevent a terrorist attack or murder attempt on the king? This world is about as dark as it gets and will explore humanity’s sheer brutality. It’s so much more than the blood and gore of war.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-among-thieves-a-tale-of-the-kin-douglas-hulick" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/mMiG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">8.

Life is pretty bleak in a city ruled by an empire helmed by a near-immortal emperor. That is, until Drothe stumbles upon a special relic, a book with secrets that could topple the empire. Suddenly, life just got a lot more interesting. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I really enjoy grimdark stories that are set in impossible situations like these. The empire stamps down on anyone who might even think about opposing it, yet here we have a relic that could overthrow it with ease. the only trouble is going to be using it and staying alive long enough to do so. Thankfully, such a regime breeds a colossal underground network of thieves. </p> <h3 id="h-7-the-mad-trinkets-cameron-scott-kirk" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/HG55wO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">7.

 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/HG55wO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Mad Trinkets</a></em> sees a renowned warrior and biographer follow a young girl as she seeks vengeance for the death of her trinket-bearing father. However, with so many occult artifacts flying around, one eventually resurrects a madman on a warpath to kill everyone on the land. Now, the group must tackle this madman and save the king. Then, and only then, can they kill the occult-obsessed king who mercilessly murdered the young girl’s father. </p>
 <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">I don’t know if there’s anything more classically grimdark than occult relics. After all, magic is common enough in most fantasy books, so it would make sense that dark magic is just as common. Even if we don’t see it. Experiencing the problems that come with playing with these dark relics isn’t something we get to explore all too often, and the way the story remains dark regardless of the outcome makes it feel somehow hopeless regardless of who wins. </p>
 <h3 id="h-6-pieces-of-hate-tim-lebbon" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tkWIvNV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">6.

If you couldn’t tell by the name, it’s another grimdark fantasy pirate book, and wow, it has some amazing concepts and ideas. Protagonist Gabriel’s family was killed by a thing named Temple, after which he was charged with hunting the entity down. Now, 1,000 years later, he’s still hunting. </p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">Gabriel enters the Caribbean Sea amid the usual deeds pirates commit, stealing, murdering, and plundering every port they can. He’s only interested in one thing and will find it no matter how many pirates stand in his way. I can’t help it. I love pirates and grimdark fantasy. This book has everything I want and more, and there’s a series to delve into once you’re through it if you enjoy it enough. </p>
 <h3 id="h-5-the-black-company-glen-cook" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/VO8Ub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">5. The Black Company: Glen Cook</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">In <em><a href="https://geni.us/VO8Ub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Black Company</a></em>, the entity The Lady embodies death and evil while protecting humanity from the darkest powers in the universe. The titular group takes coin and spreads death accordingly, but when an ancient prophecy is fulfilled, and The White Rose rises to embody good in the world, they need to seek out the one they serve if they want to continue their way of life. This is a super grim fantasy world where hope has all but died, and the mere rumor of it is fear-inducing.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-faithless-graham-austin-king" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/zCpAPUv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">4.

People are sold into slavery to work mines deep below the surface, and this is where we meet Wynn, who has been sold into such a fate and will die unless they meet their quota. As if that wasn’t bad enough, a failed ritual has stirred up a darkness that must now be fought with a light that was extinguished so long ago that no one can remember what it even felt like. </p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">I adore explorations of humanity without faith in these dire situations. Industry has taken over and become a way of life, though not in the futuristic sci-fi way where corporations and businesses are family life. Instead, life is work, or you die. </p> <h3 id="h-3-the-gunslinger-stephen-king" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Emaq0Cp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">3.

 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/Emaq0Cp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Gunslinger</a></em> is the first entry in Stephen King’s <em>The Dark Tower</em> series. Its world has always been a post-apocalyptic version of a fantastical sci-fi future to me. Here, science is magic, and protagonist Roland is just a gunslinger hunting down the man who ruined his entire life. It’s a simple story of revenge that sets up a saga you’ll want to see all the way through. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">If you love cowboys, pistols at dawn, but also zombies and a world that’s so far gone it’s basically dust, then this is a great book to explore. It’s also fairly short and easy to read, unlike a lot of other grimdark fantasy books, so it’s a good one to start with if you’re hoping to get into the genre. </p>
 <h3 id="h-2-prince-of-thorns-mark-lawrence" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/DoF1mIp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">2.

As a young boy, Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath witnessed his mother and brother’s brutal murders. He survived them, went on to become the leader of a gang of bloody thieves, and now he wants to take his rightful place as king. This is a character who has nothing left to lose and everything to gain, making him extremely dangerous and unpredictable. His story is one of legend you’ll want to follow to the end, no matter how dark it gets. </p>
 <h3 id="h-1-the-last-wish-andrzej-sapkowski-translated-by-danusia-stok" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Y8QEGN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">1.

They’re all based on European folklore and twist fairytales in unexpected ways that ensure each tale is engaging regardless of how much you think you know about it. </p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">This is a world full of imagination where fairytales have seemingly come to life and are trying to kill everyone instead of spreading happiness. The lore you’ll uncover is fascinating, but it’s also a great way to expose yourself to the greater narrative that will eventually unfold and see even stranger things occur in the name of progress, greed, and oppression. </p>

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warframe’s</em> Jade Shadows update has primarily centered around some of the new weapons you can acquire from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-ascension-mission-type-in-warframe/">Ascension activity</a>. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">The Evensong, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-cantare-warframe-jade-shadows/">Cantare</a>, and Harmony all seem like interesting weapons that should prove valuable in the right hands. However, one other weapon has come back from the dead thanks to its focus in the Jade Shadows quest alongside a new skin. Here’s the best build for the Hate in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h3 id="h-the-best-mods-for-the-hate-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods for the Hate in Warframe</h3> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Ah, the Hate. This weapon has been in <em>Warframe</em> for over a decade now, and while it’s the infamous melee weapon of the Stalker, it’s not a weapon that’s talked about much. This is despite it being a rather strong and easy-to-get scythe, even sporting an <strong>Incarnon Genesis form</strong> if you’ve reached the late game. Its strengths lie in its Normal Attack, so we’re looking to build around that including an intriguing pivot. Here’s the mods you should run:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>Reaping Spiral (Stance)</li> <li>Discipline’s Merit (Aura)</li> <li>Condition Overload</li> <li>Organ Shatter</li> <li>Weeping Wounds</li> <li>Blood Rush</li> <li>Primed Reach</li> <li>Primed Smite for current enemy (Corrupted, Grineer, Corpus, etc.)</li> <li>Berserker Fury</li> <li>Gladiator Might</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true"><strong>Berserker Fury</strong> is the crux of this build, granting major attack speed after just two melee kills. Many of these other mods simply improve upon that with additional damage, Status Chance, and Range. The Discipline’s Merit is the wildcard here. While Heavy Attacks aren’t its strongest suit, having Tennokai proc can make it well worth the lost mod slot. As always, you can swap either Primed mod for their regular variant if you don’t have it. You can also swap the Smite mod for additional attack speed through Fury if you wish.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-arcane-for-the-hate" data-injectable="false">What’s the best Arcane for the Hate?</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">By far, your best Arcane is going to be<strong> Melee Animosity</strong>. Thanks to the use of Tennokai incentivizing Heavy Attacks, having standard melee attacks grant Crit Chance will help ensure each Tennokai proc does huge amounts of damage. If that isn’t your style, Melee Duplicate is a decent alternative for that extra attack.</p>

<p data-characters="156" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s common knowledge that FromSoftware’s Souls series and its children — <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> — are some of the best games ever made. </p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">What not everyone knows, however, is that many of these games’ DLCs often provide even better gameplay experiences than the original games.

They each provide a better gameplay experience than the base game. While I’m not crazy about the Ivory King DLC, I must give it credit for a few bold choices. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">This is the first time in the series that players have to deal not only with very wide-open areas, but also with weather effects that will greatly impair the player’s vision.

I wouldn’t want to play a whole game where I can’t see crap most of the time, but I find this detour an interesting change for a DLC-sized adventure.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel" data-injectable="false">7. Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel</h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">I was originally pretty disappointed with <em>Dark Souls 3</em>‘s first DLC because I had learned it only featured two bosses even before I got to play it. It’s an all-time low when it comes to boss amount for a <em>Souls</em> DLC, and things get even worse when you enter the first fight and it’s just… not very memorable. </p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">I didn’t care for the first boss, and I <em>really </em>didn’t care for the ice-covered and insect-filled areas, but the final boss more than made up for it. Sister Friede is fast, has a bunch of nasty tricks up her sleeve that I won’t spoil here, and her fight is split into <strong>three</strong> wildly different forms. Turns out <em>From</em> wasn’t getting cheap when it came to bosses — they were just banding them together to maximize the amount of headaches they could cause!</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-6-dark-souls-2-crown-of-the-sunken-king" data-injectable="false">6. Dark Souls 2: Crown Of The Sunken King</h2> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">One of the weakest aspects of the original <em>Dark Souls</em> <em>2</em> is its level design. <em>Sunken King</em> feels like an apology letter to that. It invites players to an intricate system of underground pyramids where you can waste a lot of time just taking neat screenshots. </p>
 <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">It’s not exactly spectacular when it comes to the number of bosses, but it does feature three very different boss encounters which are pretty decent in their own right.</p> <figure data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-dark-souls-2-crown-of-the-old-iron-king" data-injectable="false">5. Dark Souls 2: Crown Of The Old Iron King</h2> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">This is an absolute slap on the face of all <em>Dark Souls 2</em> haters that just cannot dodge or deflect. The <em>Old Iron King</em> DLC features good level design, absolutely gorgeous looks, and two of the best bosses in the entire series. Yes, this is the one with the Fume Knight, the only boss in <em>DS2</em> that falls in the much-derided category of being “just a guy in armor” that’s actually incredibly challenging and fun to do battle against.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">This is the DLC you should recommend to anyone saying that <em>Dark Souls 2</em> isn’t deserving of its name. It’s cheating because it’s not the base game, sure, but please bear in mind that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-reveals-the-pendants-true-purpose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miyazaki would probably be so proud of your mischief.</a></p> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-dark-souls-3-the-ringed-city" data-injectable="false">4. Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City</h2> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">There’s not a single DLC in <em>Souls</em> history that’s even a hair below “pretty damn good”. Still, they rarely try to convey a different feel than the one you get from their main game. <em>The Ringed City</em> is the end of <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, and every moment of it seems like it’s carrying a bittersweet feeling of finality. Every boss is incredibly tough to kill, the arenas and play areas are as grand and majestic as they’ve ever been, and there’s not a single victory that doesn’t come paired with an immense sense of achievement. </p>
 <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false">Finally beating the last boss of <em>Dark Souls</em> <em>3</em> felt like killing a dragon IRL — even if the final boss isn’t a dragon, but actually just some old guy.</p> <figure data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-dark-souls-artorias-of-the-abyss" data-injectable="false">3. Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss</h2> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Dark Souls</em> only featured one DLC, but it was one for the ages. FromSoft was very FromSoft-like when they put Artorias, the <em>Dark Souls-ified</em> version of King Arthur, in the game’s cover, but not in the base game. </p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">Players were seriously hyped to see if the legendary knight who’d fought the abyss was as cool as promised — and as pissed off as you’d expect for someone who had his dog murdered by a mysterious knight. The answer was yes to both. Artorias provides such a cool challenge that he could be the only boss in that DLC and still make it work, but it features three more bosses, all pretty memorable in their own right.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-bloodborne-the-old-hunters" data-injectable="false">2. Bloodborne: The Old Hunters</h2> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>Bloodborne</em> only has one DLC, but don’t let that fool you into believing you will not get to quench your thirst for the finest old blood in the entirety of the cosmos. </p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"><em>Bloodborne’s The Old Hunters</em> is one of the best DLCs in FromSoft’s history because it’s not one, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodbornes-two-dlc-packs-have-been-combined-in-the-substantial-the-old-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two of the best DLCs</a> ever made merged into one. Yes, it turns out that From had originally intended <em>Bloodborne</em> to have two DLCs, but they ended up being nice to the point of just cramming <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-the-bloodborne-dlc-bosses/">all the best</a></strong> bosses of <em>Bloodborne</em> into one single package. The result? The best challenge that you could ever hope to get for such a low price.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree" data-injectable="false">1. Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">You’d be hard-pressed to convince me that <em>Elden Ring </em>isn’t an all-timer in the realm of video games. The open-world <em>Souls</em>-style game took the world by storm in 2022, and it’s become an instant hallmark of FromSoftware’s library.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="false">I understand fearing that this DLC would disappoint, because even “great” pales in comparison to what <em>Elden Ring</em> is. The good news is that it’s a fantastic mix of new and (revamped) old, one that rules even though the developers lied to us. Yeah, Hidetaka Miyazaki said that the playable space in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a></em> would cover an area more or less the size of Limgrave, but the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bigger-than-most-full-games-hidetaka-miyazaki-mustve-been-pulling-our-legs-when-he-said-its-map-was-comparable-to-the-size-of-limgrave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Realm Of Shadow is so much vaster</a> and has so much more to do. Perhaps it shouldn’t be battling it out with DLC, but with full-priced games.</p>

		<p>Focus and developer Saber Interactive have shared a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> gameplay overview trailer, showing off the chunky third person action and chitinous Tyranid enemies. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is coming out on 9th September 2024 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 sees the Ultramarines and Captain Demetrian Titus (now demoted to Lieutenant after the original game) stepping into the breach to face off against the Tyranid hordes invading the Imperial worlds of Avarax and Kadaku. While he might have been demoted, Titus has undergone the Rubicon Primaris process to transform him into a taller, stronger and faster Primaris Space Marine – a relatively new narrative twist in the 42nd millenium, after the return of the Primarchs.</p>
<p>Fighting alongside Titus are Brother-Sergeant Gadriel and Brother Chairon. This trio can all be player controlled, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/see-the-first-co-op-campaign-gameplay-from-space-marine-2/">Space Marine 2 features three-player campaign co-op</a>.</p>
<p>This new overview also delved into the PvE Operations and PvP Eternal War modes &nbsp;these both feature six playable classes – Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy – and lean in on a customisation system for your own Space Marine. It’s not just cosmetics, but will let you level up your weapons through play with a shared progression system. After launch, Saber will roll out content updates to add more Operations missions, PvP maps, weapons and more</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-the-sequel-you-never-expected/">Space Marine 2 was revealed in 2021</a>, and is in development at Saber Interactive who are best known for World War Z and Snowrunner. The horde element from World War Z definitely plays a part in Space Marine 2, able to show off the mass of angry aliens that the Tyranid are known for – certainly, we’re going to have much grander action than was possible in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/09/12/review-warhammer-40000-space-marine/">the 2011 original</a>.</p>
<p>Dom got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preview-better-the-boltgun-you-know/">hands on with Space Marine 2 back at Gamescom</a>, writing “Combat in Space Marine 2 is unapologetically gritty, focussing on the risk and reward of executions to renew your ability bank. Blood flies out of everywhere, which is little surprise when the Space Marines are packing swords with chainsaws built in and boltguns with ammo the size of your fist. There’s a cool parry move to utilise, and you have to mix up your approaches as you deal with ever-larger Tyranid enemies. They behave as you’d expect, like a flood of alien locusts that swarm towards you, intent on turning you to mulch. Better you do it to them first, then!”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/otherskin-is-a-new-third-person-shooter-with-strong-ps2-vibes.906756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/otherskin-ps2-style-shooter-q4-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher FDG Entertainment and developer Game Atelier have announced&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>, a third-person shooter-platformer hybrid that has more than a hint of the PS2 era about it.</p>
<p>Game Atelier, whose name you might recognize from&nbsp;<em>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom</em>, describes&nbsp;<em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>as a "fast-paced third-person sci-fi platforming action-adventure", which sure is a lot of genre names.</p>
<p>By the looks of the gameplay footage released alongside the game's reveal, it's taking cues from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/returnal-review"><em>Returnal</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/scars-above-review">Scars Above</a>&nbsp;</em>(although hopefully it turns out to be a little more successful than the latter).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/otherskin-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=MnUieJZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/otherskin-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=y8LcCrbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>blends third-person shooting and platforming for a throwback PS2 vibe.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>will take you to Planet Vandermire, a world falling prey to a threat known only as the Corruption. Hey, I think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creatures-of-ava-release-date"><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>would like a word</a>,&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava</em>, though, it looks like the Corruption is turning alien life hostile on Vandermire, and it's up to Alex to fight her way through the planet in order to learn what she can about the deadly threat.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll blast your way through a number of different enemies, and you'll be able to absorb "morphs" that will grant you new powers to help you explore your environment more effectively.</p>
<p>You can check out the cinematic reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>, which sets up the game's story and the world of Vandermire, right here.</p>

<p>The game will feature both ranged and melee combat, and Game Atelier says it'll be "a breeze" to swap between the two modes depending on the situation.</p>
<p>While a gameplay trailer hasn't been uploaded yet,&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622630/Otherskin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> does feature some gameplay footage, and if you're a fan of PS2-era shooters like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025"><em>Metroid Prime</em></a>, it looks like you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>
<p><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC in the fourth quarter of 2024. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

  <p id="oMj2e7">September is not too far away, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22821314/batman-penguin-colin-farrell-spinoff-hbo-max"><em>The Penguin</em></a>, Max’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22951429/the-batman-movie-review-2022"><em>The Batman</em></a><em> </em>spinoff TV series, seems to know it. A new trailer for the show gets right down to it in a way that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680583/penguin-trailer-teaser-colin-farrell-dc-studios-batman">previous teases avoided</a>: This is a cutthroat mafia succession story set in the dark and oily Gotham City showcased in Matt Reeves’ Robert Pattinson-led 2022 film. </p>
<p id="KB3PBX"><em>The Batman</em> star Colin Farrell now has a whole cast to strive against in his quest to fill the power vacuum following the death of boss Carmine “The Roman” Falcone — and it’s a who’s who of Gotham City mafia figures from the most influential mafia-focused Batman books. Clancy Brown plays Salvatore Maroni, the guy who threw acid in Harvey Dent’s face; Michael Kelly plays Johnny Vitti, Falcone’s nephew and enforcer introduced in <em>Batman: Year One</em>; and Michael Zegen plays Alberto Falcone, a major player in <em>Batman: The Long Halloween</em>. Finally, Cristin Milioti plays a woman who appears to be Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot’s biggest rival for power, Sophia “Gigante” Falcone, the daughter of The Roman. </p>
<p id="xETvDI">We’ll see who comes out on top — and whether Batman has anything to say about it — when <em>The Penguin</em> premieres on the Max streaming service in September</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181309/kinds-of-kindness-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="OkQqQ2">What happens to auteur theory when a film director appears to be two markedly different auteurs at the same time? If you were working on a unified theory of surrealist director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24006971/poor-things-yorgos-lanthimos-interview-emma-stone">Yorgos Lanthimos</a> that established a continuum between his early works in Greece, his English-language breakthroughs <em>The Lobster</em> and <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>, and his period Oscar contenders <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/24/18236661/the-favourite-story-ending"><em>The Favourite</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093718/poor-things-hulu-oscars-book-differences"><em>Poor Things</em></a>, get ready to scrap it. Lanthimos’ new movie, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>, arriving just six months after <em>Poor Things</em>, is a hard left turn — or perhaps a jump into a parallel universe that establishes two distinct tracks to the director’s career.</p>
<p id="v2LYXJ">It’s like <em>The Favourite </em>and <em>Poor Things</em> never happened. Those films’ rococo look, stylistic flamboyance, and broad, almost ribald humor is nowhere to be found. Neither is the archness and melodrama of Australian screenwriter Tony McNamara, who worked on both. Instead, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> stages unsettling, abstract moral fables in a starkly photographed modern world. The humor is underplayed, mordant, and pitch-black. It’s instantly recognizable as the work of that other Lanthimos, the one who made <em>Dogtooth</em>, <em>The Lobster</em>, and the darkly menacing <em>Sacred Deer</em>. Unsurprisingly, it reunites Lanthimos with his co-screenwriter on those films, Efthimis Filippou.</p>
<p id="RbiVfQ">Maybe Lanthimos is aware of this bifurcation in his work: It seems like split identities are on his mind. <em>Kinds of Kindness </em>is actually an anthology of three shortish films, with a total run time of 164 minutes. Each of the three uses the same troupe of core actors: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134902/civil-war-jesse-plemons-bodies-scene">Jesse Plemons</a>, Emma Stone, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2019/2/12/18216887/willem-dafoe-at-eternitys-gate-interview-oscars">Willem Dafoe</a>, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, and Mamoudou Athie. The same faces keep coming back as different people. And within each of the three stories, characters contend with identities that have been broken in two, that they don’t seem to have control over, or that are unreliable in other ways.</p>

<p id="w6vBrA">In the first film, “The Death of R.M.F.,” Plemons plays Robert, a businessman who has allowed his powerful boss, Raymond (Dafoe), to take over every aspect of his life, detailing precisely what he eats and when he has sex with his wife (Chau). After failing to hospitalize himself via a car accident per Raymond’s orders, Robert tries to break free of his boss’s control. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn.</p>
<p id="1j4SMO">The second segment, “R.M.F. Is Flying,” focuses on Plemons again, this time as Daniel, a police officer whose wife, Liz (Stone), a marine biologist, has gone missing on a research expedition. When Liz returns, Daniel becomes obsessed with the idea that she’s an impostor. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn. (This segment bears a striking resemblance to Julia Armfield’s excellent 2022 novel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58659343-our-wives-under-the-sea"><em>Our Wives Under the Sea</em></a>.)</p>
<p id="RdTozQ">The third episode, “R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,” casts Stone and Plemons as Emily and Andrew, cultists trying to track down a prophesied woman with the power of resurrection. The woman is central to the beliefs of Andrew and Emily’s bizarre, water-obsessed cult, led by Omi (Dafoe) and Aka (Chau). On the mission, Emily secretly and hesitantly reconnects with her husband (Alwyn) and young daughter, exposing herself to her previous, pre-cult life. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn.</p>

<p id="xvE6q1">None of these people are R.M.F., by the way. R.M.F. are the initials of an incidental but significant character in all three stories who, in the movie’s funniest meta joke, bears a passing resemblance to Lanthimos himself. R.M.F. is played by Yorgos Stefanakos, who, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10606356/#didYouKnow">according to the IMDb</a>, is a notary from Athens and an old friend of Lanthimos and Filippou.</p>
<p id="bQc4Sk">If you’ve seen any of Lanthimos’ pre-<em>Favourite</em> movies, particularly <em>The Lobster</em> or <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>, you’ll have a sense for what to expect from <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>. But Lanthimos newbies coming straight from <em>Poor Things</em> and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24046867/oscars-2024-nominations-list-predictions-movies">11 Oscar nominations</a> may be in for a shock. The flavor of surrealism Lanthimos employs here is very different. Each story takes a somewhat recognizable situation from modern, middle-class life and puts a twist on it that is absurd, symbolic, or terrifying — and frequently all three. The performances are deliberately stilted, and the characters’ behavior is inexplicably weird, but somehow painfully relatable at the same time. Where David Lynch’s movies, for example, tap into the unnerving illogic of dreams, Lanthimos — this version of him, anyway — takes slightly cruel delight in making the emotional realities of waking life as upsetting and unnerving as nightmares.</p>
<p id="GSpfn8">In this, he gets a lot of help from composer Jerskin Fendrix and cinematographer Robbie Ryan, who both rolled straight into <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> from <em>Poor Things</em>. For my money, Fendrix’s discomfiting plinky-plonk musical sketches work much better in this alienated modern world than they did in <em>Poor Things</em>’ Victorian fantasia. Ryan, meanwhile, turns in radically different work for this project. Where <em>Poor Things </em>was saturated in lush, artificial lighting and distorted fish-eye-lens frames, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> is shot with the geometrical, roomy austerity of a Stanley Kubrick movie.</p>

<p id="XLg4Q6">The movie was filmed in and around New Orleans, and it gets fantastic mileage from its locations, conjuring a distinctive mood for each segment: sleek, luxurious modernism in “The Death of R.M.F.,” becalmed suburbia in “R.M.F Is Flying,” and seedy edgelands in “R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich.” Lanthimos, Ryan, and the costume and production design teams keep coming up with cool, arresting images: Stone peeling out of a motel car park in a purple Dodge Challenger; Dafoe and Chao bending over to cry single tears into a paddling pool; Dafoe strutting his stuff in dress shorts and high socks; Plemons tenderly stroking the face of a bum in a police station.</p>
<p id="LRaKwn">Even within the constraints of Lanthimos’ underplayed style, a movie like this is a treat for the actors, and Plemons’ transformation is particularly extraordinary: not just his bearing, but his whole body type seems to shift from piece to piece. You could call this movie <em>The Plemons Variations</em>. Stone’s agonizingly brittle performance as Emily dominates the third segment, although Dafoe and Chao are hilariously convincing as smug cult leaders. Lanthimos’ sensibility is an ideal match for the warped tranquility of a modern cult, and this third segment might be the most enjoyably weird window to peek into in <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>.</p>
<p id="JAI67W">It’s not the tidiest of the stories, though, and by the point it arrives, viewers have already been immersed in Lanthimos’ uncomfortable world for a long time. All three stories sit somewhere between short-form and long-form storytelling, and all three unfold at an unhurried pace. It’s a long sit, which may be part of the reason why the first story, “The Death of R.M.F.,” feels the most gripping and incisive. It will be interesting to try watching the three separately, like a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24146275/best-limited-series-mini-tv-shows-watch-streaming">miniseries</a>, when the movie is available at home; I can also imagine them expanded into individual 80- or 90-minute movies, as <em>Planet Terror</em> and <em>Death Proof </em>were after the release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s 2007 pulp anthology <em>Grindhouse</em>.</p>
<p id="JCeSuZ">But watching them in isolation means missing the subtle but fascinating echoes between them, and the cumulative effect of piecing together the fragmented performances of the film’s brilliant cast. <em>Poor Things</em> is ultimately a hopeful journey for a deconstructed person, Stone’s Bella Baxter, who’s working to make herself whole. <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> returns us to the Lanthimos who — cruelly, but with tenderness and wry humor — prefers to pick people apart, open them up, and lay them out on the slab.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="v2OFcV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147524/mars-express-movie-review-sci-fi-french-animation"><em>Mars Express</em></a>, the new sci-fi noir thriller from French director and animator Jérémie Périn, is finally available to stream on VOD this week following its American theatrical run in May. Périn’s film is fantastic: a sophisticated, hard-boiled detective story set in a futuristic society where humans and robots live side by side that’s as indebted to <em>Chinatown</em> and <em>The Long Goodbye</em> as it is to <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p id="Vu3wa5">Polygon recently had a chance to connect with Périn, so we had to ask: <strong>What was your first favorite anime, and what’s your favorite anime now?</strong></p>
<p id="OEJsgv">My Favorite Anime is Polygon’s column dedicated to collecting the stories of the biggest celebrity anime fans in the world, charting a path from their earliest introductions to Japanese animation to the series and films they love today. Here’s what Jérémie Périn had to say.</p>
<hr id="ngW9fx">
<h2 id="q7lPNH"><strong>What was your first favorite anime?</strong></h2>

<p id="urWMx6">Based on the manga by Buichi Terasawa, <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> is a 1982 sci-fi adventure anime about a bored office worker who accidentally discovers that he’s a swashbuckling mercenary who erased his own memories in order to elude a deadly group of space pirates. After regaining his memories, Cobra resumes his life as a mercenary, embarking on adventures around the universe with his partner, Lady Armaroid.</p>
<div id="3NchBy"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pw6H9doABWY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zdwRMf">While Terasawa cited <em>Star Trek</em>, the James Bond film series, and the animation of René Laloux as his inspirations while writing the manga, the premise of <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> also bears a striking resemblance to Philip K. Dick’s 1966 short story “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,” later adapted by Paul Verhoeven as <em>Total Recall</em>.</p>
<p id="gRrOK9">The other anime Périn cited, <em>The Rose of Versailles</em>,<em> </em>is a historical drama that takes place  before and during the French Revolution and follows the story of Oscar François de Jarjayes, the youngest daughter of a military general who raises her like a son so that she will one day succeed him as commander of the royal guard at the Palace of Versailles. Distraught over the plight of the French public under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien_r%C3%A9gime"><em>ancien régime</em></a>, Oscar eventually leaves the guard to fight alongside the revolutionaries with her lover, André.</p>
<div id="FAjLFO"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJIeJIqw-J0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="cr14WM">While on the surface these two anime couldn’t appear further apart, they actually share one remarkable thing in common. Both <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> and <em>The Rose of Versailles</em> were directed by Osamu Dezaki, the anime legend who directed the 1970 anime adaptation of <em>Ashita no Joe</em> and co-founded the Japanese animation studio Madhouse. Dezaki is considered one of the most influential anime directors of the ’70s and ’80s, known for his distinctive visual style that incorporated split-screen imagery, Dutch angle shots, and other techniques that were uncommon in anime at the time. He is also best known for his use of pastel freeze frames, called “postcard memories,” which have since become a foundational visual trope throughout the entire medium of modern anime. </p>
<h2 id="Rr5DO3"><strong>What’s your favorite anime now?</strong></h2>

<p id="IhHuvc">Directed by Mamoru Oshii and produced by Production I.G, <em>Patlabor 2: The Movie</em> is a 1993 sci-fi political thriller set in an alternate 2002 where “Labors,” large-scale robots designed for heavy construction work, have revolutionized Japan’s economy. To respond to the increase in Labor-related crime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police forms a special crime unit that deploys their own Patrol Labors (“Patlabors”) to resolve these cases.</p>
<div id="cN0StD"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enwTApkJ0cc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="f69A0Z">Unlike previous anime in the Patlabor franchise, <em>Patlabor 2: The Movie</em> is not a police comedy, but instead an explicitly political film that touches heavily on domestic and international issues Japan was facing at the time it was produced, such as the debate over Japan’s postwar identity and the deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Cambodia. The plot concerns the members of the Special Vehicles Unit of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department who work to apprehend the leader of a terrorist cell conspiring to incite havoc under the pretense of a coup.</p>
<p id="zxz3oQ">With a budget over twice that of the first Patlabor movie and <a href="https://animetudes.com/2022/04/22/mobile-police-patlabor-2-the-movie/">an improved layout production system</a> that saw talented animators and artists like Masahiro Ando, Satoshi Kon, and Hiroyuki Okiura working under animation director Kazuchika Kise, <em>Patlabor 2</em> was lauded for its more sophisticated photorealistic animation style, a style which would later be iterated upon in Oshii’s next film: the 1995 cyberpunk action anime <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>

Many of the ones I saw within a few hours of the announcement poked fun at how Zelda<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/WendyDoodles/status/1803103467755675926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/WendyDoodles/status/1803103467755675926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> might use a table</a></span> or a chair in battle, akin to a professional wrestler.

It’s endlessly charming thanks to a great cast of characters and interesting missions, pulled together and kept interesting by engaging writing.

You are the first robot, or “robo” reporter aboard the <em>Times &amp; Galaxy,</em> and in a fun bit of customization, you can create your robo reporter from three body type presets and a wide-ranging color palette (I named my custom robo <em>Kotaku</em> Staff, obviously). Once aboard you’ll meet the staff of eccentric investigative reporters, sports journalists, art critics, and opinion writers. Before long, you are sent out on assignment<br></p><p>Assignments are the central gameplay loop of <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>. These are short adventures out on planets during which you must interview and investigate an area in hopes of writing the best story possible. When chatting with potential witnesses or sources you are offered dialogue options. Choose carefully, because you won’t always be able to ask every question, and whatever the interview subject says in response is all you have to work with. Assignments span all types of potential articles—the tutorial assignment is about a vehicle crash that may be hiding a corporate cover-up, but later assignments introduce you to court reporting, reviewing a restaurant, covering a cat show, and more. There are both exciting and boring assignments—as is the case in real journalism—but <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s sharp writing makes all of them fun thanks to a never-ending parade of weirdos to encounter.</p><figure id="" data-id="3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-recommend-id="image://3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-recommend-id="image://3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a satisfying challenge to each assignment as well: turn a boring story into a hit. That’s where the build-a-story feature comes in. As a robo reporter, your special software lets you piece together sections of an article based on the information you’ve gathered. Depending on how thoroughly you explored and interviewed, you will have more options available to you. At the end of an assignment, you get to choose the hed, lede, nutgraf, key quote, and any detail that may add to the story.<br></p><p>If you don’t know what these things mean, don’t worry—as a new robo reporter, <em>Times &amp; Galaxy </em>will give you a crash course in journalism basics—no silly master’s degree that costs way too much money required! Each option also has a point rating based on how it will raise or lower readership and reputation. With that information, you can boost the paper’s standing, or ruin it.</p><h2 id="h6576"><a id=""></a><strong>Office space</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-recommend-id="image://6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="687" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-recommend-id="image://6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="687" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When not out on assignment, you get to relax on the Scanner, the paper’s home base/spaceship. Time aboard the Scanner serves as a chance to get to know your coworkers. While they all have their own beat, each writer isn’t defined by their coverage. Learning about every hobby and interoffice spat makes talking to every person worth it. The continuous fighting between opinion writer Richard Gravity and Copybot (the robo copy editor) is one of my favorite side stories in the game. Though as much of an annoyance as Richard Gravity is, I cannot in good conscience side with the em-dash hating Copybot. Learning about and building relationships with—you can romance almost anyone on the Scanner—earns complimentary comparisons to time spent chatting with the beloved cast of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><em>Mass Effect</em></a></span> series while aboard the Normandy. That isn’t by accident: studio founder Ben Gelinas is an ex-Bioware writer who worked on <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and <em>Andromeda</em>.<br></p><p>As with <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s assignments, talking to everyone and exploring every corner of the Scanner is rewarded. While on assignment you are rewarded with better story options, aboard the Scanner you are rewarded with plain old character-building! </p><p>Writing dialogue and in-game text is where the developers at Copychaser Games flex their muscles the most, especially when it comes to satire. Jokes about newsrooms being short-staffed, not getting paid, em-dash arguments, endless PR emails, and more are so funny because they are so true to life. I might be biased since I am exactly this game’s audience but my fiancee—who ignores me as much as possible when I talk about my job—also loved the game’s comedic tone. That’s likely because in casting you as an intern<em> Times &amp; Galaxy </em>can teach you about journalism—even in a basic form—so that you can then laugh at the in-jokes.<br></p><h2 id="h6577"><a id=""></a><strong>This is fine (laughs nervously)</strong></h2><p>There’s so much fun to be had in<em> Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s comedic sci-fi journalism world that it’s easy to just take it at face value. That wouldn’t be bad, it’s a fun and funny game! As you play, you’ll learn a bit about journalism along the way and enjoy the wonderfully written characters. But I can’t help but see something a little more sinister under the surface.</p><figure id="" data-id="e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-recommend-id="image://e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-recommend-id="image://e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not that the robo reporter is a thinly veiled metaphor for the influx of AI into journalism. I don’t think that is the case (<em>Kotaku</em> Staff would never take my job, right?), but rather the build-a-story structure encourages a mindset that equates good stories with readership going up. That might mean writing bad, sensational, or even outright false articles that twist the information you gained from sources can get you more eyes. Each hed, lede, and nutgraf option can be reduced to a number—as can an entire story. If it boosts numbers, it will keep a paper alive (hopefully). It’s a striking commentary on the state of modern media.<br></p><p>If this year’s satiric but more aggressive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-simulator-itch-indie-game-1851382388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-simulator-itch-indie-game-1851382388"><em>New York Times Simulator</em></a></span> is a less subtle game about the risks, responsibilities, and struggles of modern-day journalism, then <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em> takes the spoonful of sugar approach with sharp and funny writing that makes it endlessly entertaining—even if it stings a bit. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"It's driven by military requirements, but it's also going to be used for non-military stuff. And it's really cool, it's really something." </p><p>Luckey <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1797697304167944233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teased earlier this month</a> that he was working on a new HMD and would formally announce the device at AWE. However, the extent to which the headset would be used in a non-military capacity was not further elaborated on.</p><p>Luckey is well-known in the virtual reality industry for releasing the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/oculus-rift-review">Oculus Rift virtual reality headset</a>. Luckey founded Oculus in 2012; roughly two years later the company was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/25/facebook-to-acquire-oculus-vr-for-2-billion">acquired by Meta (then known as Facebook) for $2 billion</a>. In 2017, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/30/oculus-co-founder-palmer-luckey-leaves-facebook">Luckey left Facebook</a>. Neither party explained Luckey's departure, but it came amid controversial political donations <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/23/oculus-founder-palmer-luckey-allegedly-donated-funds-to-pro-trump-support-group">during the 2016 U.S. presidential election</a>.</p><p>Following his departure from Facebook, Luckey co-founded Anduril Industries, a military defense technology company. Luckey recently dipped his toes back into the consumer hardware space, as earlier this month he revealed the <a href="https://modretro.com/blogs/blog/the-future-is-retro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModRetro Chromatic</a>, a $199 handheld shaped like a GameBoy featuring a backlit display and the ability to play Game Boy, and Game Boy color cartridges. Like its competitor, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a>, the ModRetro Chromatic supports FPGA-based emulation. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.
