            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Partner Preview, independent developer Bellring Games announced Mistfall Hunter, a dark fantasy third-person multiplayer extraction RPG with some rather obvious inspiration from the Soulslike genre.</p>
<p>The game takes place in a setting where there has been an all-out war between Supreme Gods and Outer Gods, resulting in a apocalypse. Nearly all the Gods have fallen in this war, and their blood has turned into the Gyldenmist, a corrosive force that sweeps across the land, warping the souls of the living and driving them to madness and monstrous mutations.</p>
<p>A few humans cling to their sanity, seeking refuge in the last remnants of civilization. However, a mysterious girl called Dew has the power to resurrect fallen heroes and give them immortal bodies. These reborn champions, known as the Gylden Hunters, follow her into the heart of danger, battling Gyldenized creatures and harvesting Gyldenblod. Their mission is to mend the shattered Web of Fate and bring the world back from the brink of oblivion.</p>
<p>Mechanically, Mistfall Hunter is described as a third-person action game where aiming is key. Players will be able to master a variety of combos and customize skills to suit their strategy. The game offers different classes, such as the Mercenary, Sorcerer, Blackarrow, and Shadowstrix, each equipped with unique weapons and traits.</p>
<p>Some classes can wield multiple weapons, unlocking entirely new combat styles. Players can then seamlessly switch between weapons to turn the tide of a fight. The RPG elements are ensured with a variety of talents across classes to create powerful builds. Collect high-level gear and stack unique modifiers to unlock incredible passive abilities that transform your combat strategy and increase your effectiveness in every battle. As a Gylden Hunter, you can play solo or team up with up to two friends.</p>
<p>The land is rich with precious Gyldenblod and endless loot, but countless enemies stand in your way - be they fearsome Gyldenized creatures or rival players. As with any extraction game, each battle is a high-stakes gamble, where death means losing everything you've gathered so far, keeping the tension high at all times.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest announcements of the October 2024 Xbox Partner Preview is certainly Subnautica 2. Unknown Worlds has revealed the game will launch next year in early access on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/subnautica-2-d27f94" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>) and Xbox Series S and X, and it will also be available to Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>publisher KRAFTON previously&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-is-a-multiplayer-sequel-using-game-as-a-service-model-says-krafton-will-be-made-with-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a></span>, the game will support multiplayer for the first time in the franchise. Up to four players will be able to explore the ocean's vast environments together, working together to craft tools, build bases, and face the challenges of a planet filled with beauty and danger.</p>
<p>In this sequel, players will venture to an all-new ocean world that features multiple biomes, from towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields. Each biome has its own diverse ecosystem and unique creatures. Players will explore a world full of mysterious life forms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. They will scan creatures to learn more about them and use the Biosampler to collect samples for study. They will even get the chance to evolve their own genetics to better adapt for survival. As a survival game, the series also emphasizes tool usage, and Subnautica 2 will include recipes for more advanced ones. Thanks to an overhauled building system, bases will be more customizable.</p>
<p>PC players can already take a look at the minimum and recommend system requirements below.</p>

<p>We could be getting a new look at Marvel’s Wolverine from Insomniac before the end of the year. According to a claim by <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1847057694894522819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known inside</a>r Kurakasis, Sony and Insomniac are “gearing up” to show fans more from Wolverine soon.</p>



<p>“From my little digging, it looks like Sony is gearing up to show off some new stuff from Marvel’s Wolverine,” they said. “It’s hard for me to determine when it’ll happen, but I’m guessing it’ll be this year—either at TGA or at some unannounced, super-secret event.”</p>

<p>There has been no confirmation PlayStation or Insomniac that a new look at Wolverine is coming. So, despite the source being accurate in the past, please take the information with a grain of salt until something is announced or Insider Gaming has confirmed its legitimacy.</p>



<p>Insomniac and PlayStation have been quiet regarding Wolverine in an official capacity for some time. The last news players got about the game came via the massive leak that happened in late 2023 and early 2024. At that time early looks at gameplay mechanics made their way online.</p>



<p>There’s been no confirmation of a release date for the game, either. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniacs-wolverine-wont-release-until-2025-report-claims/">last rumor from 2023</a> claimed that Wolverine wouldn’t launch until 2025 at the earliest. It will also reportedly have a more dark and violent tone than past Insomniac games.</p>



<p>When do you think we’ll get another trailer for Marvel’s Wolverine? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/gaming-leaks-and-rumors.15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-adding-significantly-more-npcs-to-make-towns-feel-more-alive-on-top-of-other-improvements<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Feed the birds.</h2></div><section><p>Horizon: Zero Dawn was developed by Guerrilla Games, and its remaster is being worked on by them as well. But today, the remaster's co-developer Nixxes stepped into the spotlight on the PlayStation blog to highlight a number of improvements we'll see in the remaster, including the addition of lots of new NPCs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/17/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-a-deep-dive-into-its-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaks down a number of updates to the game</a>, perhaps the most notable of which is that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will "significantly boost the number of non-player characters." This doesn't mean more quests or story, but it does mean that villages and camps will have more folks just wandering around, attending to their business. Brian van Nunen, senior technical game designer at Nixxes, offered more details and what I find to be a delightful example of this:</p><blockquote>Building the game for PS5 allowed us to leverage the increased amount of memory available, enabling us to significantly boost the number of non-player characters," he said. "We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfil their needs. We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations. For example, there is now a woman feeding geese at the well in Meridian, reusing an existing sowing animation. Additionally, on the bridge to Meridian, we’ve made significant strides in improving the atmosphere and sense of activity.</blockquote><p>Let's hear it for feeding the geese!</p><p>More NPCs isn't the only change players will see. The blog also goes into detail about how foliage is being overhauled to be more dense, realistic, and closer to the original concept art. Terrain, too, is being updated, including snow and sand that actually moves as it's disturbed. This was a feature in the Frozen Wilds expansion, but in the remaster we'll see it elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In addition to these improvements, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered benefits from 10 additional hours of motion capture data for various characters, which Nixxes says will make conversations seem livelier and closer to those in Forbidden West. Mark Bazelmans, senior technical artist, has a really fascinating explanation for how all this data was incorporated into the massive game:</p><blockquote>Horizon Zero Dawn has almost 300 conversations and well over 3100 dialog options, so we needed to find a way to easily integrate this huge number of updated animations into the conversations," he said. "We created a tool with Python to process the almost 2500 mocap files that Guerrilla provided to replace the original animation in the conversations, removing deprecated events and replacing those with the mocap and setup.</blockquote><blockquote>We then focused on creating a pipeline in Maya for our animators to easily load, edit and re-export the individual mocap files for any other edits that were needed, such as finger animation, art direction feedback and fixes. Animators could select the conversation and subsequent dialog option from a list which created the scene from scratch, or simply opened it if it already existed. Our tool referenced the characters and imported the dialogue audio, so the animators could time the movement better and create the camera cuts and layout. Later, we extended this pipeline to also include existing animations for both conversations and cinematics, as some of these also required edits. Our animators could then go into Guerrilla’s DECIMA engine and edit or change the updated conversation.</blockquote><p>And there's more. The blog post goes over details to how lighting was improved, both world and cinematic, and how character models were updated to have more detail to hair, skin, and oufits. Aloy has peach fuzz, and apparently you can see it. And while before only Aloy would react to the environment and weather, now both her and her companions will react when it's too hot or cold.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>If you're a sicko for fascinating, in-depth explanation of how game dev works, this blog goes into incredible detail about how some of this stuff works with quotes from a number of Nixxes developers.

                <p>During this week's Xbox Partner Preview, 505 Games revealed the first extended look at Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, a Soulslike game that is already drawing comparisons to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. The story is set in China near the end of the Ming dynasty, but the visuals of the newly released trailer suggest that myth and magic will play a bigger role in the game than actual history. The video also offers a glimpse of the powers that the players will have at their commands.</p><p>Wuchang is the name of the game's leading character, and she appears to favor using a sword. However, the video also demonstrates that she can use her staff to fire projectile weapons and apparently some magic-based attacks as well. It's difficult to get a read on Wuchang's personality, since the only spoken lines in the trailer belong to her unnamed enemy. That character openly desires revenge for the fall of the Ming empire, and Wuchang stands between him and his goal.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Against the backdrop of the battles between Wuchang and the god-like beings whom she challenges, the land of Shu has been stricken by a plague called feathering, which can cause mutations. But in Wuchang's hands, these feathering mutations can unlock additional powers or change her form into something more than human. Wuchang appears to be formidable even without those abilities, but she might need them for some of the boss fights ahead.</p><p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. 505 Games and Microsoft have also announced that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will be on Game Pass on day one of its release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fifa-ea-sports-fc-history-book<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the 21st century <em>EA Sports FC</em>, formerly known as <em>FIFA</em>, is one of the biggest and most lucrative video game series on the planet. But it wasn't always a colossus. Like every other franchise it had to start <em>somewhere</em>, and in <em>FIFA's</em> case, it was a small studio in Vancouver and a license that didn't even cover the player's names.</p><hr><p><strong>The following is excerpted from the book <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bitmapbooks.com/products/a-tale-of-two-halves-captains-edition" target="_blank">A Tale of Two Halves: The History of Football Video Games</a></em>, by Richard Moss. The book is available for purchase now from Bitmap Books.</strong></p><hr><p>One of the most popular video game franchises in the world started here, with fake players (EA didn’t realise a FIFA licence only granted use of the FIFA name) who all looked the same, 48 international teams (but no club sides) and a side-scrolling isometric perspective (technically it’s a dimetric projection, which means that the viewing angle is the same on two axes but different on the third axis of space, giving a perspective that seems both flat and elevated at the same time).</p><p>Those humble beginnings are hardly surprising, given the project’s development. It started in EA’s new UK office, dreamed up as a high-tech rival to the genre’s leading lights and prototyped with three different camera angles – one of which was isometric – before upper management shunted development off to EA’s Canadian studio Extended Play. Its small, Vancouver-based dev team lived in constant fear of cancellation, knowing how bluntly apathetic EA’s senior execs felt about soccer, but they managed to get it done and out the door in time for the Christmas 1993 shopping window – whereupon they blew past the UK office’s lofty predictions of 300,000 sales to net more than half a million worldwide and top spot on the UK all-format games charts.</p><figure><figcaption>Right from the beginning, the FIFA games wanted to feel like an interactive TV broadcast.</figcaption></figure><p><em>FIFA</em> was, at release, very much an odd duck. Rare was the sports video game without an obvious inspiration within its subgenre, but here we had a title that looked and played unlike any football video game ever. Its closest corollaries in design and graphics were not <em>Sensible Soccer</em> or <em>Kick Off</em> or <em>Striker</em> or anything from the arcades; they were <em>NBA Live</em>, <em>NHL Hockey</em> (both other EA Sports titles) and <em>4D Sports Tennis</em> (a first-person 3D tennis sim with the same lead programmer).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Here’s one bit of authenticity that didn’t stand the test of time.<br></figcaption></figure><p>It handled poorly compared to the genre’s top titles, with clunky controls that I’ve seen likened to running through treacle, unbalanced action, shaky goalkeeper AI and a range of ridiculous exploits, but <em>FIFA</em> had a never-before-seen combination of authenticity, style and snazzy animations. It was miles ahead of every football game ever in its presentation; it looked and sounded more or less like football as you saw and heard it on TV, and its gameplay was good enough, even if it wasn’t great.</p><figure><figcaption>Every player looked the same, but FIFA’s graphics shone for their detailed animations and pixel artistry.</figcaption></figure><p>This was just part of its draw, though. <em>FIFA</em>’s mega-success owed much to the fact that it takes mere seconds of play before you trigger your first spectacular moment. Even before you memorise which of the three buttons does what, you’ll invariably hit an accidental screamer from 50 yards out that the keeper tips over the bar, or see one of your players do an acrobatic leap for a flick-on header on a high ball. The downside is that you have less control over your players, as the game does most of the magic for you, but it was sports gaming’s version of popcorn action – light, quick, exciting fun with a near-zero barrier to thrilling, highlights-worthy moments.</p><figure><figcaption>Before backflips and corner flag punches we had this: scoreboard animations that popped up on every goal.</figcaption></figure><p>EA had already baked annualised updates into their sports strategy, with the Madden series running yearly since its second entry in 1990, and NHL and NBA Live yearly right from their beginnings. With both commercial and critical success right out the gate – an 85% average across 21 reviews for its Mega Drive original, according to MobyGames – <em>FIFA</em> would be no different. The first game had set a template that would be refined, tweaked and updated every year, for as long as the franchise remains popular, and as such we’d soon see <em>FIFA 95</em> (1994) arrive with made-up player names now augmented by eight playable national leagues (six from Europe plus the US and Brazil) and a smattering of bug-fixes, gameplay enhancements and minor additions – chief among them AI improvements (mainly to goalkeepers), a slick new menu system, penalty shoot-outs, predefined set-piece options, bicycle-kicks, more responsive (still slow and syrupy) controls and volleys. (And fouls and offsides&nbsp;– incorrectly implemented anyway – are again turned off by default.)</p><p>These were worthy improvements, especially for anyone keen to embark&nbsp;on a multi-season club career, but they also flagged the future of sports games: incremental updates, focused on quality-of-life improvements and player/league licensing, interspersed with intermittent engine overhauls to bring the technology&nbsp;up to modern standards.</p><figure><figcaption><em>FIFA 95 </em>made incremental improvements to the presentation, with special attention to menus and titles.</figcaption></figure><p>After <em>FIFA 95</em> (and a 3DO spinoff), the development team shifted focus to next-gen systems and a new 3D graphics engine, but they were in no rush to abandon the large audience of SNES and Mega Drive owners worldwide. New 16-bit editions of FIFA would continue for another three years, each running on the same old 2D isometric engine but granted a variety of new features. <em>FIFA 96</em> came with new, suave-looking sprites that had been rendered on an expensive SGI workstation, along with long-awaited real player names and various other new features. Then <em>FIFA 97</em> added an excellent indoor mode and a button for triggering a ‘GOOOALLLL!’ yell during goal celebrations, and <em>FIFA 98 </em>featured a Road to the World Cup mode for playing through the qualification tournaments. These new features evidently caused corner-cutting elsewhere, as the presentation dropped a few notches in quality, but by this point hardly anyone was paying attention to 16-bit anyway.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><em>FIFA 97</em>’s fun indoor mode remains a fan favourite to this day.</figcaption></figure><p>FIFA would conquer the 32-bit space just as effortlessly as it had the 16-bit era, becoming the de facto football game on console and the yardstick against which all others were compared. It had redefined what makes a great football game and reoriented market expectations for what a football game should be, and it did all this in the 16-bit era. FIFA’s multicultural, Canada-based development team had revolutionised the genre, although we were hardly set for a new era of gameplay or graphical stability; further upheaval was just around the corner.</p><div><p><strong>Foul Play: Dodgy Goal Exploits</strong></p><p>FIFA has always had a reputation for enabling outrageous goals, banged in from all sorts of angles and distances (even the halfway line!), but its earliest incarnations included a programming oversight that would forever rankle among losers of tense intra-family and friend-vs.-friend tournaments. In real football, players must not (intentionally) interfere with a goalkeeper’s attempts to release the ball – they can’t nick it in the middle of a punt or block a throwing action. But in early FIFA titles you could merrily stand in the way and with a well-timed tap of the button steal possession and/or redirect the ball goalwards, resulting in cries of outrage from any human opponents but a mere shrug from the virtual referee – who ignores the infraction and allows any resulting goal.</p></div><figure><figcaption>Time your button-press right and number eight here will get a free shot at goal.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden has suggested the continuing push toward more powerful - and more costly - console hardware is unsustainable, arguing that "fighting over teraflops [is] no place to be... We need to compete on content".
</p>
<p>
Layden - who served as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of Worldwide Studios before leaving the company in 2019 - was asked by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/">VGC</a> if the console industry's current business model was sustainable, given the increasing development costs associated with the ongoing pursuit of incrementally more powerful hardware.
</p>
<p>
"We've done these things this way for 30 years," Layden replied, "every generation those costs went up and we realigned with it. We've reached the precipice now, where the centre can't hold, we cannot continue to do things that we have done before."

<p>
Layden said he believed it was time for a "real hard reset" on the industry's current business model, even a "hard reset on what it is to be a video game. It's not 80 hours, it's not 90 hours, but if it is that's a whole different category."
</p>
<p>
He added the effectiveness of chasing more powerful hardware had "plateaued", and was unlikely to appeal to the majority of players. "We're at the stage of hardware development that I call 'only dogs can hear the difference'," he continued.
</p>
<p>
"If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing. It has to be super optimal... you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things... We're fighting over teraflops and that's no place to be. We need to compete on content. Jacking up the specs of the box, I think we've reached the ceiling."
</p><p>
Layden's comments come ahead of Sony's new PlayStation 5 Pro console, which launches on 7th November and is primarily being marketed on the promise of improved performance and visual fidelity for supported PS4 and PS5 games. The machine's £700 price tag hasn't been particularly well-received, however, raising the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb7vhF2ELZg">question of who exactly it's for</a>.

<p>Bandai Namco has just revealed the players arriving with Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Season Pass DLC 2 and more Daima content for other Dragon Ball titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems the developers are doubling down on Daima content for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero and other titles within the franchise. The second DLC for Sparking Zero will include Vegeta (mini) and Glorio from the new series. With the addition of Gamma 1 and Gamma 2 from DLC 1, the game has revealed four upcoming playable characters through the Season Pass. This Season Pass is set to introduce more than 20 characters across three DLCs.</p>

The company says the problem “impacted a small number of legitimate player accounts,” and all accounts affected were restored.</p><p>However, zebleer, who runs the Phantom Overlay store selling cheats, claims the problem is much bigger than Activision’s post makes it seem. <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1847024778600689706">In a detailed post on X</a>, they write that when Ricochet scanned the memory of a player’s computer to find known cheat software, one of the signatures it scanned for was a plaintext string reading:</p><div><blockquote><p>54 72 69 67 67 65 72 20 42 6f 74 (Trigger Bot)</p></blockquote></div><p>As a result, zebleer says that “for quite some time,” it has been possible to get someone permanently banned simply by sending them a friend request with the phrase or posting a message like “Nice Trigger Bot dude!” in the game’s chat since it would then show up in their memory and get scanned by Ricochet. </p><p>Despite Activision saying a “small number” of legit accounts were affected, zebleer claims that “several thousand random COD players were banned by this exploit” before anyone started targeting big streamers. </p><p>Zebleer points to <a href="https://x.com/BobbyPoff/status/1841912385977655744">BobbyPoff</a>, a <em>Call of Duty</em> streamer, as one of the people <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1846953059345486159">banned</a> due to the person using the exploit since October 3rd before his account was <a href="https://x.com/Headdband/status/1846708945227804864">suddenly unbanned yesterday</a>. Like other players and <a href="https://x.com/notcloakzy1/status/1841942184259400182">streamers</a> caught up in the bans, there had been intense speculation and discussion over whether or not BobbyPoff was a cheater, even as he maintained his innocence and some people <a href="https://x.com/TheMainDevent/status/1844176079831081110">posted jokey videos</a>.</p><p>The Call of Duty Updates account says that the Ricochet team will share a blog post tomorrow, though the account didn’t specify if the post will discuss this exploit. </p><p>Activision didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But eventually, it made its way over to Xbox and thanks to Microsoft buying Bethesda, it’s now a part of Game Pass. And that’s awesome because while <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo </em>is a gorgeous game set in a highly detailed digital Tokyo that is filled with some cool sidequest and spooky enemies, some players might not enjoy the game’s focus on combat. This scary first-person adventure feels like a perfect fit for Game Pass, letting you try it out and see if you enjoy its creepy combat. And if not, <em>Ghostwire </em>didn’t cost $60 to find that out. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-recommend-id="image://faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Telltale Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-recommend-id="image://faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Telltale eventually drove their <em>The Walking Dead</em> formula into the ground, the first couple of seasons of episode adventures did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-the-walking-dead-should-be-game-of-the-year-5972488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-walking-dead-should-be-game-of-the-year-5972488">a fantastic job of capturing the comic book franchise</a></span>.

<p>Apex Legends has been a hit within the Battle Royale scene since its release back in 2019. Developed by Respawn, the game has quickly grown within the competitive and casual scene. Looking to get involved in competitive Apex Legends? You should probably learn all the Apex Legends ranks first.</p>



<hr>







<p>Just like the majority of other popular competitive games, Apex Legend’s Ranked system has a specific order that players have to climb up in order to reach the very top.</p>



<p>Like other games, Apex Legends also follows the traditional Bronze through Gold format. </p>







<ul>
<li>Bronze </li>



<li>Silver (120 RP)</li>



<li>Gold (280 RP)</li>



<li>Platinum (480 RP)</li>



<li>Diamond (720 RP)</li>



<li>Apex Predator (1000 RP)</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Each rank requires a specific amount of Ranked Points to reach it and has a IV through I system.</p>



<h6 id="h-ranked-top-esports-tournaments-what-are-the-best-esports-tournaments">Ranked: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-tournaments/">Top Esports Tournaments | What Are the Best Esports Tournaments?</a></h6>



<hr>







<p>Unlike many other games, Apex Legends actually rewards people who climb up its Ranked system. Each ranking provides competitors with different rewards, including weapon cosmetics and more.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>



<li>Dive Trail</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Apex Predator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>



<li>Dive Trail</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many other Battle Royale games simply just reward you with a badge each time you rank up in competitive. Apex Legends, though, seems to want to get players more involved with their Ranked system by giving out different prizes.</p>



<p>These rewards change with each new season the game releases.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-the-game">How to Rank Up in the Game</h2>



<p>There are a few ways you can climb the ranks in Apex Legends. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kills (1 RP per kill)</li>



<li>Top 10 (2 RP)</li>



<li>Top 5 (4 RP)</li>



<li>Top 3 (7 RP)</li>



<li>Champion (12 RP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, winning a match will give you the most points to help you rank up, so put your focus on getting first.</p>

            <p>
Almost two years after its was confirmed to be in the works, Amazon's live-action TV adaptation of Sony Santa Monica's God of War series is reportedly getting a "do-over" after the companies involved decided on a "different creative direction".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-sony-executive-producers-depart-new-writers-joining-1236118075/">according to Deadline</a>, which reports showrunner and executive producer Rafe Judkins (who also serves as showrunner on Amazon's The Wheel of Time adaptation) has now left the God of War project, along with executive producers Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus.
</p>
<p>
Deadline says the trio had already completed "multiple scripts" for God of War's first season - scripts that were reportedly "praised" by Sony and Prime executives - but it seems these will now be scrapped as the companies pursue a "different creative direction". Despite the shift, Deadline's sources say the TV project remains an "important asset" for Prime, with Sony and Amazon now looking to hire a "whole new writers room" for the series.

When Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">initially announced its God of War adaptation</a> back in December 2022, it explained it would follow Kratos' "dangerous journey with his estranged son" to fulfil his wife's dying wishes and "spread [her] ashes from the highest peak". However, "Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world."
</p><p>
It's unclear what Amazon and Sony's new "creative direction" for the series may be, but given the original pitch was to adapt God of War's now-completed Norse saga, it's possible a decision has been made to instead tie the series into future releases. There have, for instance, been rumours Sony is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">looking to revive the original God of War trilogy</a> in some form, so perhaps the TV show might be looking to plant its flag in ancient Greece.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the outcome, reports of a "do-over" suggest it's going to be some time before Amazon's live-action God of War TV series makes it to the screen. Before then, Prime has the (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-series-two-is-ahead-of-schedule-says-amazon-head-of-tv">currently "ahead of schedule"</a>) second season of its acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> adaptation on the way, and it was reportedly also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">eyeing up a Mass Effect series</a> at one time.

But then I hope the reveal is that it’s a combination of deep, misguided guilt, and also survival. It’s him just saying, ‘I’ll just keep lowering my expectations the whole time.’” Big mood, as the kids say.</p><p>Pattinson eventually settled on an equally unlikely inspiration for Mickey 17 and 18's voices. “[Mickey 17 is] a little like Stimpy,” he told <em>Empire</em>, referencing the absurdist 90s Nickelodeon about chihuahua and a cat. “When 18 comes in, it’s a little bit more like Ren.” <em>Mickey 17 </em>hits theaters on January 31, 2025, but if you want to study up on Pattinson’s inspirations the <em>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</em> is currently streaming on Paramount+.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It felt like major updates to DayZ come too few and far between, but there’s still nothing like the survival game. It’s one of the go-to survival experiences for tens of thousands of players, myself included, and it keeps improving. Most recently, we received a look at DayZ 1.72, which is available now on PC and consoles, with the full patch notes!</p>

You won't find it on store shelves at the moment, but you can order it online and pick it up at your local Best Buy in a week or so.</p><p>It's described as a "two-way" device, meaning you can charge your controllers while connected to the stand or while playing. The actual charger is basically the official Joy-Con grip without the handles. You're essentially turning a pair of Joy-Con controllers into a single USB-C wired controller. It's remarkable that Nintendo hasn't released its own Joy-Con charging stand until 2024, a year that has been filled with speculation around the Nintendo Switch's successor. But perhaps Joy-Con controllers and this stand will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p>Though this is the first official Joy-Con charging stand, it's not the first Joy-Con charger designed by Nintendo. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charging-Grip-Stand-Nintendo-Switch-Japan/dp/B01N7TGKYE?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now-discontinued Joy-Con Charging Grip</a> was one of the few first-party accessories released alongside the Switch in 2017. A replacement for the standard Joy-Con grip that came with the console, it also charged your controllers while playing. You could refer to that as a one-way Joy-Con charger, though the inclusion of ergonomic handles was a nice bonus. This new two-way option drops the grip and adds the stand.</p><p>If you want the original Joy-Con Charging Grip, you can get a preowned one for $20 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-joy-con-charging-grip%2F142687.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendos-first-official-switch-joy-con-charging-stand-launches-today-cappy-not-included%2F1100-6527242%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.

One of those licensed options is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Nintendo-Switch-Joy-Charging-Dock/dp/B01MR6JD1M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA's Joy-Con Charging Dock</a>, which originally sold for $30 but is now available for only $20 at Amazon.

It'll probably be one of the most common accessories gifted alongside new consoles. If you're looking to buy a Nintendo Switch as a gift this year, Nintendo released two holiday bundles this year.

Super Nintendo World - Universal's Mushroom Kingdom-inspired theme park land - will fling open its pink Peach Castle doors in Orlando, Florida on 22nd May next year.
</p>
<p>
This third iteration of Super Nintendo World, which follows versions opened at Universal Studios Japan in 2021 and at Universal Studios Hollywood last year, arrives as part of Universal's new 110-acre, multi-billion-dollar <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/gb/theme-parks/epic-universe">Epic Universe theme park</a>.
</p>
<p>
Super Nintendo World is one of five themed areas at the new park, which visitors can explore alongside Celestial Park, Dark Universe, How to Train Your Dragon's Isle of Berk, Super Nintendo World, and Harry Potter's Ministry of Magic. And if you've seen Super Nintendo World's previous iterations, you'll know what to expect here.

<p>
Super Nintendo World Orlando features the same <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-full-ride-through-of-super-nintendo-worlds-chaotic-mario-kart-ride">AR-based Mario Kart ride</a> seen in Japan and Hollywood, alongside the more sedate (if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-super-nintendo-world-temporarily-closes-following-yoshis-adventure-ride-fire">occasionally infernal</a>) Yoshi's Adventure dark ride - which didn't make the cut at Universal's smaller California park. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, it includes Super Nintendo World's second, Donkey-Kong-themed area, along with the impressive Mine-Cart Madness rollercoaster - both of which are set to open in Japan later this year following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-delay-hits-nintendo-theme-park">lengthy delay</a>. Visitors can also expect the same wrist-band-based interaction system seen at other parks, and the usual assortment of shops and restaurants.
</p><p>
Super Nintendo World's other destinations have generally been well-received, despite their currently lacklustre ride selection, and Universal reportedly has big plans for the future, with Pokémon and Zelda areas having long been rumoured in theme park insider circles. It's been <a href="https://orlandoparkstop.com/news/rumors/possible-zelda-ride-concept-to-replace-lost-continent-in-islands-of-adventure/">claimed</a> a Zelda land will replace the now-defunct Lost Continent area of Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, for instance - reports that gained traction after Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-of-legend-of-zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-at-universal-studios-pulled-offline">spotted in a quickly yanked official Universal video</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
But first, Super Nintendo World comes to Florida on 22nd May next year, with a Universal Singapore version to follow. And we might even see one in Bedford eventually, if Universal decides to go ahead with plans to built a 476-acre theme park and resort in the UK.

Steve Jackson Games has announced the 40-year-old solo adventuring RPG book series will be getting a new printing thanks to a historic 50-book publishing collaboration.</p>
<h2>The Fighting Fantasy US Reprint Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> co-creators Sir Ian Livingston and Steve Jackson have signed a US publishing agreement for the acclaimed book series with Steve Jackson Games.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fighting-fantasy-steve-jackson-and-sir-ian-livingstone-screenshot.jpg?itok=jT0-iUdy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fighting-fantasy-steve-jackson-and-sir-ian-livingstone-screenshot.jpg?itok=NPJ0f_Gc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the press release, Livingston said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To have a new publisher in the USA is a special moment in the history of <em>Fighting Fantasy</em>. We have known Steve Jackson (US) for more than 40 years, having distributed Steve Jackson Games in the 1980s when we owned Games Workshop. Steve also wrote three fantastic Fighting Fantasy books which caused a lot of confusion at the time when people didn’t realize there were two Steve Jacksons! We look forward to exciting times ahead in the USA for new and existing <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> fans.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fighting Fantasy</em> was a solo adventuring RPG book series. It debuted in 1982 with the adventure <em>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</em>. The books were revolutionary at the time thanks to their nonlinear narratives with dice-rolling RPG mechanics. It was a series where the player's decisions and dice rolls would determine the story's outcome.</p>
<p>This mix of solo adventuring and RPG mechanics made these game books stand out from other gamebooks. Its contemporaries include Joe Dever's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/joe-devers-lone-wolf-series-returns-to-print" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lone Wolf</em></a> series, which was a choose-your-own-adventure book with light journaling and resource management.</p>

A number primed to increase with this new printing stateside. And considering a full series sells for about <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/383576492819?chn=ps&amp;_trkparms=ispr%3D1&amp;amdata=enc%3A1lxHSXENsRgKcuW32hXA1Ew17&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=101&amp;itemid=383576492819&amp;targetid=2319404999269&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9006662&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=21222256297&amp;mkgroupid=167054596991&amp;rlsatarget=pla-2319404999269&amp;abcId=9408285&amp;merchantid=108045050&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw68K4BhAuEiwAylp3kgwdQ6oSkEqk5x1bYf0qZTPevW0H1DxAei3o-Oqz6nW9RHWj5MOSTRoCqvgQAvD_BwE">$120 on eBay</a>, this printing may be more financially viable.</p>
<p>The first five books in the series will arrive sometime in 2025. An additional five volumes will be released sometime later that year.</p>

You aren’t alone! Horror games can be incredibly intense, even for those who love a good scary movie. But maybe you still want to enjoy some games on Halloween, just without all the jump scares.<br></p><p>To help folks out, I’ve put together a list of games I think will get anyone into the Halloween spirit without making you scream in horror or close your eyes in fear.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-recommend-id="image://ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wideload Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-recommend-id="image://ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Zombies! Love ‘em or hate ‘em, these undead bastards are a big part of our current pop culture landscape. But most of the time you are running from them, killing them, or being eaten alive by the undead. <em>Stubbs The Zombie </em>flips the script and has you star as a zombie, eating brains and farting on people. It’s a bit odd, but if you can find a way to play it this Halloween season, I highly recommended it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stubbs-the-zombie-s-bizarro-throwback-soundtrack-perfec-1845111300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stubbs-the-zombie-s-bizarro-throwback-soundtrack-perfec-1845111300">Or just listen to the soundtrack</a></span>.

But not many games are actually set during Halloween. Sure, some games like <em>Bully </em>include Halloween sections or areas, but few games let you explore a Halloween night as a kid. This is one of the main reasons I had to include <em>Costume Quest </em>and its sequel on this list. In these turn-based RPGs released by Double Fine,  you play as kids in Halloween costumes fighting monsters and trick-or-treating. What’s more Halloween than that?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-recommend-id="image://bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Klei Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-recommend-id="image://bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, you might not expect <em>Don’t Starve</em>, a fantastic 2D survival game featuring crafting and resource management, to be a creepy-but-not-spooky video game experience. But that just means you haven’t played <em>Don’t Starve,</em> which can be a very creepy and tense survival game where monsters lurk just outside your flimsy walls. And be careful, they won’t stay away forever...</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="shc5t3gwlqasmeg5aqdi" data-recommend-id="image://shc5t3gwlqasmeg5aqdi" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="shc5t3gwlqasmeg5aqdi" data-recommend-id="image://shc5t3gwlqasmeg5aqdi" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Weird, strange, and haunting monsters and other bizarre paranormal things fill the world of <em>Control</em>, the third-person action shooter from Remedy Entertainment. It makes for a creepy and unsettling atmosphere. But there aren’t any real jump scares or moments of extreme gore in <em>Control</em>. Instead, the fear comes more from the unknown and the strange things you encounter. And if anything gets too scary, just shoot it a hundred times with your fancy paranormal pistol.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-recommend-id="image://du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Terminal Reality</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-recommend-id="image://du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That <em>Ghostbusters</em> game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 wasn’t perfect, but it was a perfect <em>Ghostbusters</em> game if you get what I’m saying. What I mean is, it had all the sound effects, characters, and ghosts you love, it just all came in a mediocre third-person shooter package. The recently released remastered versions of this game don’t improve them much, but they do look nicer and it is now easier than ever to play this game. And while the action might be...<em>eh</em>, the ghosts are still ghosts and perfect for Halloween.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-recommend-id="image://g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-recommend-id="image://g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any of the <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> games would be perfect to play around Halloween.

It’s a must-watch for me this time of year. And while I’m not saying anyone should remake or try to pump out a sequel, maybe you’re like me and can’t help but think about the&nbsp;world of the film and the characters who inhabit it and wonder, “What happened next?” Well, wonder no more! Back in 2005, <em>Oogie’s Revenge</em> was released on PS2 and Xbox. It’s a sequel to the original film and it’s like a Disney spin on <em>Devil May Cry</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cl6bIr2KMQM?t=942&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cl6bIr2KMQM?t=942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seriously.</a></span> It’s not great, but it’s better than you might expect and a perfect game for the creepy Halloween season.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-recommend-id="image://h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Namco Bandai</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-recommend-id="image://h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released in 1988, <em>Splatterhouse </em>is a classic beat ‘em up from Namco that plays like other beat ‘em ups from that era. But unlike many of those other games, <em>Splatterhouse </em>was on the gruesome and scary side. Still, its frights are pretty quaint when compared to <em>actual </em>scary games. In <em>Splatterhouse</em>, you play as someone who is totally not Jason Voorhees and work your way through levels punching and killing monsters who are stupid enough to get in your way. It still feels great in 2020 and its retro scares are best experienced in a dark room during a cool October night.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-recommend-id="image://d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-recommend-id="image://d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t let the game’s cute and gorgeous 2D art fool you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-lamb-review-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc-1849423403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-lamb-review-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc-1849423403"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a></span> is a creepy little roguelike action game about running a cult and fighting monsters.

It features gameplay similar to the classic <em>MediEvil </em>games, but with a more colorful and cartoony visual style. You unlock different weapons and forms as you progress through a half dozen or so levels. All in all, it will take you about four or maybe five hours to complete, perfect for a weekend. Open your windows, let that fall air in and enjoy <em>Pumpkin Jack</em>, hopefully with some Halloween candy close at hand.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Star Citizen’s turbulent 12-year development isn’t a secret. A quick search on YouTube or Google will reveal a plethora of issues that the project has suffered since its inception in 2012. From broken promises to cut features, backers have learned to either abandon ship or strap themselves in for the ride with no final destination in sight. Frustrations are at an all-time high, and for many of those working on the game, it’s a mutual feeling.</p>



<p>On October 1st, Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) developer’s inboxes were hit by a new mandate from Global Head of Production Erin Roberts; those working on Citizencon deliverables must work every day, including weekends, until October 19th. The mandate forced employees to work 19 straight days for a minimum of 8 hours per day up until Citizencon, with TOIL (time off in lieu) being offered for the Saturday and Sunday hours worked, as well as breakfast goods and lunch being offered. </p>



<p>It’s a mandate that was quickly altered after staff raised questions about the legalities surrounding it. So, instead, CIG opted to give employees Sunday off if they meet the minimum threshold of 56 hours worked from Monday to Saturday – a change that would still be illegal in UK law if CIG’s employee contracts didn’t contain an opt-out agreement of the 48-hour weekly limit. In addition to the sudden change, Insider Gaming had also asked for comment on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original report on the mandate</a>, which seemingly prompted an email sent by Erin Roberts to staff to also give employees October 21st off as a free company holiday. Perhaps it was just a weird coincidence, but it’s a gesture that some employees say likely wouldn’t have happened if the news of the mandate wasn’t going to be made public.</p>



<p>Most staff saw it as a bandaid over a bullet wound, saying that the company needs a complete overhaul to survive. Some workers think that CIG has already passed the point of no return, with its future heading in an unavoidable crash course due to its mismanagement and overspending. Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve spoken to over a dozen past and current employees on CIG’s current situation, which gives a brief insight into the company’s internal workings and possible future.</p>



<h2 id="h-bleak-financials-amp-spending">Bleak Financials &amp; Spending</h2>



<p>As of 2022, <a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/blog/corporate/cloud-imperium-financials-for-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to its financials</a>, the company has spent $637 million on development, with 2020 – 2022 averaging over $106 million a year. Assuming that the company continues spending around $100+ million a year, it doesn’t take a mathematician to realize that the $790 million raised so far at the time of writing is on the verge of, or has likely, run out. It’s an assumption felt by both current and former employees at the company, who say they have been experiencing the effects of apparent dwindling funds these past 12 months.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cloud Imperium Games’ financials</figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, CIG quietly laid off an estimated 100-150 staff members at its Austin and LA offices. The company had hoped the move would go under the radar because affected employees were told to sign Non-disclosure agreements, which prevented them from announcing their departure on social media. Former employees said those who refused to sign were told they would not get any form of severance. </p>



<p>Undoubtedly, the information about layoffs hit the internet because of those who refused to sign NDAs or decided to speak to the press. The information on the layoffs eventually forced CIG’s hand, and the company issued a statement revealing that “a small number of positions were eliminated” and that it had “decided to co-locate as much development as possible.” </p>



<p>Current staff members also felt the financial burden, with wage increases being frozen and the prospect of career progression seemingly being halted, all as the cost of living continues to rise. Some employees tell me they are now struggling to make ends meet, leading some to contemplate leaving the company and questioning their future in the industry entirely. </p>



<p>“But at least we have baristas serving us coffee here,” one employee joked, referencing the over-the-top coffee bar that takes up a large portion of the 9th floor of its new Manchester building.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Concept Image of Cloud Imperium Games’ coffee area at its Manchester office.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to sources who believe backers’ money could be spent much more efficiently, the coffee bar is just one example of CIG’s unnecessary spending habits. Spending tens of thousands of pounds on custom furniture and oversized props isn’t unusual, sources say, with management justifying its spending habits because it’s “pushing the boundaries of game development.” Its Manchester office, which is still under construction on one floor, consists of custom wall paneling, doors, and even desks to make employees feel like they are living in the Star Citizen universe. One employee described the office as “almost like a space version of Willy Wonka’s factory” that “caters to taste over functionality.”</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>An image of Cloud Imperium Games’ Manchester Office taken by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoredGamer/comments/143pvjv/cgi_manchester_office/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/u/Dense-Art-1895</a></em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-development-issues">Development Issues</h2>



<p>“Pushing the boundaries of game development” is often a phrase used by management, said sources, who use it repeatedly to explain CIG’s unorthodox game development processes. This includes rationalizing almost all processes of the development pipeline, including creative to its teaching processes on how to work on CIGs Star Engine, a heavily modified version of CryEngine that has been the cause of years of delays and pushbacks. Staff describes the engine as Frankenstein, a mishmash of parts that is difficult to work with at the best of times, never mind when features are added, changed, or removed daily.</p>



<p>Both current and former staff say that one of the fundamental issues at CIG is the creative process, which will see the head honcho of CIG, Chris Roberts, make game-defining changes daily that can cause weeks of issues. Roberts is relatively well-known in and out of the Star Citizen community for being a perfectionist at the best times. Still, developers feel that his constant changes in vision and scope have become one of the most significant burdens to Star Citizen, Squadron 42, and CIG as a development studio. </p>



<p>Staff say that this isn’t just on the prominent game features either, but down to the minutest of details. They said that decisions that should take a matter of seconds creatively can sometimes take hours, or even days, due to his micromanagement. “I’ve genuinely been sat in meetings that got derailed for 30 minutes so that the placement of objects that players are likely never to interact with could be discussed in detail,” said one former employee, “there’s just no actual focus on getting the game done,” they continued. </p>



<p>“Sometimes the most basic features can be reviewed by him [Roberts] half a dozen times, for it then to be scrapped or changed on the 7th review,” said another employee. The constant changes in scope are made worse by inappropriate deadlines, many of the employees said, which will see months’ worth of work expected in weeks or even days, which still ultimately runs the risk of being scrapped. </p>



<h2 id="h-cult-like-culture">Cult-Like Culture</h2>



<p>The constant creative changes, micromanagement, poorly optimized engine, and lack of standard development processes have led many experienced developers to leave CIG in recent years, with some of those I spoke to preferring a more traditional form of gaming development. CIG’s change in experienced staff has undoubtedly had a knock-on effect on its culture, with sources saying that the studio now has one of the strongest cult-like mentalities in the entire industry. </p>



<p>It’s the result of CIG’s own doing, which will see experienced staff replaced by younger and cheaper developers, who’ll find it difficult to learn from more experienced staff because there aren’t any. One source went on to say that they are aware of some people who were hired simply because they were fans of the game.</p>



<p>“It’s created an unhealthy place to work; you can’t push back on anything,” said one current developer. “They are repeating mistakes that other companies made 20 years ago, which contributes to the shortcomings of their ambitious features,” said a former developer.</p>



<p>Most experienced staff will leave for one reason or another within a year, which has created a studio where a large portion of its staff will have Star Citizen as their first shipped game.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future">The Future</h2>



<p>It remains to be seen how CIG will continue developing its games as its funds seemingly dwindle, but the studio is actively seeking additional funding and ideas to prolong development. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft was given a brief presentation for Squadron 42, CIG’s spin-off campaign of Star Citizen that consists of around 20 different chapters (levels) of various lengths. It’s understood that the plan for Squadron 42 is to get it out of the door as soon as possible, with directors of the company hoping the influx in cash will sustain Star Citizen’s development and help to push Squadron 42 as a multi-game series, which will see the game’s story span over several different episodes. As for when Squadron 42 will launch, I wouldn’t want to guess, but it’s understood that the game has only just made it to its “feature complete” stage, despite the claims last year.</p>



<div><p>Other ideas to fund Star Citizen, including more ships at higher prices, will not surprise those familiar with the game’s development. However, one potential oddball is a third game in development themed around a medieval fantasy. Sources said that the details of the project are slim, but it is a means for CIG to release more than just one style of game, they said. Nevertheless, whether or not the backers of Star Citizen want their money to fund a fantasy game is a question for another time, as is how long the game will take to develop.</p><p>Cloud Imperium Games is set to hold its annual Citizencon on October 19th-20th, 2024, with fans planned to see a demo of Squadron 42’s Chapter 1, which was internally said to “get our community on board with the fact they are getting very close to Squadron’s full release.” </p></div>



<p>Of course, fans should also expect to see a lot more of Star Citizen. But as the past 12 years have shown us all, nothing is set in stone.</p>
