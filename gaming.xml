            <p>
Sure, everyone's excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but do you what's <em>more</em> exciting than Elden Ring's Shadow of the Ertree DLC? New hairdos, that's what! And FromSoftware is adding a bunch of them in a free update arriving next Thursday, 20th June.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like a bit of a biggie too, combining a day-one patch for Shadow of the Erdtree alongside various improvements for the base game. As detailed on Elden Ring's <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1801616168299499599">social media feed</a>, it brings bug fixes, balance adjustments, plus a number of new features.
</p>
<p>
With the update installed, for instance, it'll finally be possible to see all your recently acquired items at a glance (previously, new items just vanished into pile, making it a bit of a pain to figure out what, exactly, you'd just picked up); newly acquired items will be marked with an exclamation mark and a Recent Items tab has been added to the inventory.

<p>
 There are some changes to Summoning Pools too; post-update, Active Summoning Pools will carry over to NG+, and it'll be possible to enable or disable individual Summoning Pools in the newly added Map Functions menu. Only active Summoning Pools will be selected when using the Small Golden Effigy, FromSoftware notes.

<p>
 And finally for now, there're five new hairstyles, which can be applied during character creation, when using the Clouded Mirror Stand, or via Rennala's Rebirth feature. And apparently that's not quite everything either; FromSoftware says "other features" will be included in the update when it arrives on 20th June. That, of course, is one day ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's release on 21st June, and anticipation for its arrival remains sky high. With good reason too, if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">extremely positive early word</a> is anything to go by.

<p id="iTweao"><strong>Genre: </strong>Superhero drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Directors: </strong>Shannon Tindle, John Aoshima<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Christopher Sean, Gedde Watanabe, Tamlyn Tomita</p>
<p id="IlizaR">Ultraman is back, this time in an all-new animated feature from directors Shannon Tindle (<em>Lost Ollie</em>) and John Aoshima! <em>Ultraman: Rising</em> centers on Ken Sato, a braggadocious baseball player who returns to his home of Tokyo to inherit his father’s role as the superhero Ultraman. After inadvertently adopting a baby kaiju, Ken must raise the newborn while balancing his personal and heroic responsibilities. </p>
<p id="EP2c9z">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23942014">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="GFQRMz"><em>Ultraman: Rising</em> doesn’t spend a whole lot of time on the decades-spanning mythos and world-building around the character. Instead, Tindle and company hone the film’s focus down to Ken’s family dynamic, and his subsequent arc from an obnoxiously selfish braggart to a humbler, more mature hero. That decision absolutely works to the movie’s benefit, allowing audiences who might otherwise be unfamiliar with the character to grasp the broader stakes and particularities of his universe.</p></blockquote>

<p id="TsXe3z"><strong>Genre: </strong>Documentary<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 32m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Andrew McCarthy</p>
<p id="0l3i3N">In the ’80s, the young stars of John Hughes’ <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and Joel Schumacher’s <em>St. Elmo’s Fire</em> were dubbed the “Brat Pack” — much to their chagrin. Anthony Michael Hall reunites his former co-stars and colleagues to recount what it was like to come to fame in ’80s, how the intense media attention and “Brat Pack” label dogged them throughout their careers, and how they either overcame or succumbed to the pressure of their breakout.</p>

<p id="3lT6Dt"><strong>Genre:</strong> Biographical drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 21m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Ava DuVernay<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga</p>
<p id="CIGxel">Ava DuVernay’s latest film is a drama based on the life of Isabel Wilkerson, the author of the 2020 book<em> Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents</em>. The film follows Wilkerson’s (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) journey through Germany, India, and the United States as she researches material for her book.</p>
<p id="4rIt7j">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24043052/origin-review-ava-duvernay-isabel-wilkerson-caste">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="pJmaOP">These stories, and the context Wilkerson places them in, are powerful. The almost comical footage of Ellis-Taylor organizing piles of books, writing on a whiteboard, and tapping on a laptop while she ties her case together in voice-over adds nothing but cringe value. It’s easy to imagine a documentary version of <em>Origin</em> that’s more like <em>13th</em>, with the historical reconstructions stitched together by archive footage, talking-head interviews, and biographical information about Wilkerson. It might have been just as compelling, and much more satisfying and coherent. But the takeaway is just the same, and one I intend to act on myself: Go buy a copy of <em>Caste</em> and read it.</p></blockquote>

<p id="J04QsY"><strong>Genre:</strong> Action thriller<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 1m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Dev Patel<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dev Patel, Sharlto Copley, Pitobash</p>
<p id="ARjsIF">Dev Patel stars in his directorial debut as an unnamed street kid who, years after his village was burned to the ground, earns a living as a monkey-masked fighter in an underground boxing club. He embarks on a campaign of brutal violence to exact revenge on the men responsible.</p>
<p id="bwqMBw">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122067/monkey-man-review-dev-patel">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="QEFMgk">When <em>Monkey Man</em> finally shifts into gear for its action scenes, there’s a clearer vision at work — though perhaps “clear” isn’t the word for it. Patel, working with fight choreographer Brahim Chab and cinematographer Sharone Meir (<em>Whiplash</em>), shoots the fights up close and personal with a frenetic handheld camera that judders and whip-pans with the force of every blow, and deftly stitches these shots together into head-spinning, unbroken runs of movement. Influenced by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112377/best-korean-action-movies-watch-streaming">Korean, Indonesian, and Bollywood action movies</a>, what the style sometimes lacks in clarity it makes up in ferocity and impact. The desperation of Kid’s first bathroom battle with Rana is brilliantly conveyed (Kher is fantastic in an old-school heavy role), and the extended climax is intermittently stunning, although the editing sometimes struggles to maintain focus when things get busy.</p></blockquote>

<p id="sijoDJ"><strong>Genre: </strong>Psychological horror drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 40m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Jane Schoenbrun<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Justice Smith, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Ian Foreman</p>
<p id="HCYefo">Jane Schoenbrun returns with a follow-up to their 2021 breakout <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em>. Justice Smith (<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>) stars in <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> as Owen, a shy student who befriends Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), an older classmate who loves a TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>. As the two grow older, their relationship to one another — as well as the show itself — transforms in ways that neither could have predicted, unearthing uncomfortable truths and revelations that call into question their entire sense of identity. </p>
<p id="3fuR0R">The film’s themes and conclusion have opened up a lot of room for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166500/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-interpretations-hope-jane-schoenbrun">thoughtful discussion and speculation</a>, and Polygon got to speak to Schoenbrun about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">the origins of <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>’s production</a>, as well as how <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> inspired the film’s in-universe TV series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/14/yacht-club-games-reveals-new-shovel-knight-updates-including-a-brand-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Yacht Club Games hosted its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysyNfkYWGW4">Direct-style presentation</a> today, primarily to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Shovel Knight. As such, the event featured various Shovel Knight-related announcements, including the reveal of a brand-new game.</p>

<p>This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The studio also states, “We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.”</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait to see what this new game is, but the studio did reveal an enhanced version of the original game called Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX. This is essentially the definitive edition of the 2014 indie classic, featuring 20 new playable characters, a rewind function, save states, online multiplayer, cheats, and more. Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX has no release window or announced platforms. As for smaller updates, Yacht Club announced free DLC for<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/shovel-knight-dig/digging-down-in-glory"> Shovel Knight Dig</a> (its final content pack) and Pocket Dungeon.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbpEXPSvFtc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Yacht Club also provided an update for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/01/mina-the-hollower-is-shovel-knight-studio-yacht-club-games-next-project">Mina the Hollower</a>, its upcoming action-adventure game. A new trailer offers a montage of gameplay, and Yacht Club states the project is “nearing completion of the initial pass on all level content.” It plans to spend the next few months polishing and refining gameplay. Yacht Club reveals that the game has grown larger than expected since its reveal in 2022; it now features an “expansive” overworld and RPG elements. The studio says to expect a big gameplay reveal in the near future.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As the life of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a></em> goes on, the meta is going to change drastically. Things are going to get better as new enemies (and factions) are introduced. Things will also get worse. As of right now, these are the best weapons after the Viper Commandos patch in <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="93" data-injectable="false">This could drastically change as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-say-patrols-are-still-overbearing-despite-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the whole spawn fix actually made things feel a lot tougher</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-in-helldivers-2-after-the-viper-commandos-patch" data-injectable="false">The best weapons in <em>Helldivers 2</em> after the Viper Commandos patch</h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">The following weapons will be displayed when fighting the current factions. Weapons will only include <strong>Primaries, Secondaries, Throwables, and Support Weapon</strong>s. Typical call-down stratagems like the Eagle 500KG, other air strikes, and turrets will not be on this list.</p> <h3 id="h-smg-72-pummeler" data-injectable="false">SMG-72 Pummeler</h3> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">If you need something fast and light, this concussive SMG can do the trick. It won’t clear waves of enemies like other weapons can, but it can soften up mobs and slow them down so you can get a chance to recover or shake them off. It pairs really well with a Ballistic Shield.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-sg-225ie-breaker-incendiary" data-injectable="false">SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary</h3> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">The Incendiary Breaker didn’t get a buff this patch, but it’s really good at clearing out smaller Terminids from close and medium ranges. Weirdly enough, it’s also one of the best weapons to take down Shriekers which have now become part of normal enemy waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-las-16-sickle" data-injectable="false">LAS-16 Sickle</h3> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The Laser Sickle is probably one of the better assault rifles now in this game because, with proper trigger discipline, you can have infinite ammo. With more small fries to kill, this will be even stronger.</p> <h3 id="h-sg-8p-punisher-plasma" data-injectable="false">SG-8P Punisher Plasma</h3> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">The Punisher Plasma gun didn’t get a buff either, but it’s really good at blowing up groups of weaker enemies. Of course, with big risk comes big rewards. Shoot this too close to yourself and you’ll die.</p>
 <h3 id="h-sg-22-bushwhacker" data-injectable="false">SG-22 Bushwhacker</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">The new triple-barrel shotgun <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-all-items-in-viper-commandos-warbond-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Viper Commandos Warbond is the highlight of the set</a>. Its stopping power is great enough as a deterrent against Stalkers and medium-tier enemies. Don’t sleep on this one.</p> <h3 id="h-p-19-redeemer" data-injectable="false">P-19 Redeemer</h3> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">The Redeemer pistol is still the best all-rounder for a sidearm. Whether you’re fighting the bugs or the bots, you can’t go wrong with this. It’ll save you in a pinch.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-arc-12-blitzer" data-injectable="false">Arc-12 Blitzer</h3> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">This gun may not be able to clear waves like other shotguns, but its inherent stun mechanic will be a godsend. The Blitzer can stop a Devastator in its tracks and essentially perma-stun it so that it can’t attack you. Of course, if you have many other enemies surrounding you, this won’t be as effective.</p> <h3 id="h-plas-1-scorcher" data-injectable="false">Plas-1 Scorcher</h3> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Since the R-36 Disruptor isn’t as great as it used to be, the runner-up is now the better pick. A few well-placed shots on enemy weak spots can melt them in seconds. It’s best used against the Automatons as semi-auto rifles aren’t the best in fending off the Terminids.</p>
 <h3 id="h-g-16-impact" data-injectable="false">G-16 Impact</h3> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">The Impact grenade is the perfect tool to finish off any heavy that wasn’t killed by a call-down stratagem or ordnance-type weapon. Because it’s also an explosive, it can take care of Fabricators and Terminid hives.</p> <h3 id="h-g-13-incendiary-impact" data-injectable="false">G-13 Incendiary Impact</h3> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Impact version of the Incendiary grenade is king. No fuse timer makes it exceptionally good at killing mobs of medium and small enemies. Like its normal non-incendiary counterpart, this can also destroy Fabricators and Hives.</p>
 <h3 id="h-flamethrower" data-injectable="false">Flamethrower</h3> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">The Flamethrower is almost a must-have at higher-level Terminid missions. It can mow down all the small enemies and even Chargers. With Titans being your only concern, you can save other Stratagem slots to deal with them. Just, be careful not to incinerate yourself.</p> <figure data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-heavy-machine-gun" data-injectable="false">Heavy Machine Gun</h3> <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">Don’t mind the recoil. If you need stuff to be destroyed, the HMG is it. Yeah, the reloading can be a pain, but the amount of firepower it has is plenty.</p> <h3 id="h-spear" data-injectable="false">Spear</h3> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Gone are the days of the Railgun, but the Spear has now taken its place. With its recent tracking buffs, this thing can take down the biggest heavies in <em>Helldivers 2</em> with ease. Just make sure to keep that backpack on you.</p> <h3 id="h-quasar-cannon" data-injectable="false">Quasar Cannon</h3> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="false">Much like the spear, the Quasar Cannon is something you’ll ideally use just to take down huge enemies in one or two well-placed shots. The cooldown for each shot is 13 seconds, so make each one count.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/schim-is-a-chill-navigation-game-where-you-play-as-a-shadow-hopping-spirit-searching-for-its-lost-human/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=schim-is-a-chill-navigation-game-where-you-play-as-a-shadow-hopping-spirit-searching-for-its-lost-human<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The older I’ve gotten, the more I come to appreciate slow-paced games that encourage you to kick back for an hour or so at a time. <em>Coffee Talk</em> and <em>Donut County</em> are among my favorites in this “chill” genre. <em>SCHiM </em>may soon join them if its demo is any indication.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">I gave the <em>SCHiM </em>demo a try when I spotted it while perusing the sea of survival crafting games in Steam Next Fest, egged on by the low-key visuals and the promise of a relaxing time. In this hectic life <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and industry</a>, we can all benefit by giving ourselves an hour to unplug and unwind. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">The premise of <em>SCHiM </em>sounds like something out of Studio Ghibli or maybe Pixar. Everything, from living beings to various objects, has a “spirit” called a schim. Losing it is akin to the loss of your soul. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-hop-along" data-injectable="false">Hop along</h2> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><em>SCHiM</em> starts you off teaching you how being a spirit works. Apparently, the rules on losing your schim are a bit fluid, since you can hop out of your host at will and enter other shadows so long as you eventually return. The protagonist schim in question is shown belonging to a young boy, whom you can briefly control while the schim operates in his shadow — as characterized by fantastic googly eyes. </p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Controlling the schim is a breeze. You can manipulate the spirit in various shadows as if swimming in a darkened pool. A single button tap allows you to leap from the shadow, and you make progress by entering another shadow nearby. </p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The schim can’t survive on illuminated surfaces, but you are given a short “safety hop” to make it to a shadow that was just out of your reach. Don’t worry about dying; you warp back to the nearest shadow if you mess up. You can swap the isometric camera’s angle around when you need to find another shadow just outside of your vision.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Objects found in the world can help you progress. | Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true">A single button press lets you interact with some objects, usually as a fun way to see how they react. You can cause a tree to shake or a child to sneeze if you hit the button while in their shadow. The moment I learned you can make bicycle bells jingle, it was over. I had to voraciously jingle every bike chime and make each duck I found quack with reckless abandon. For those desperate to know, <em>yes</em>, you can make ducks quack to the “Shave and a Haircut” jingle. No doubt 90% of everyone who plays the game will try it.</p>
 <h2 id="h-spirit-hopping" data-injectable="false">Spirit hopping</h2> <p data-characters="620" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">As suggested, <em>SCHiM </em>does have a story to share. It’s not as subtle as something like, say, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unpacking-preview-steam-next-fest-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unpacking</a></em>, where you connect the delicate threads via the environment and the objects you manipulate. The game begins with you paired with the young boy as you view his life in brief fragments. As a child, he plays without a care in the world. Time passes, and you watch him experience high school, heartache, college, and finally, early adulthood in his very own tiny cubicle in the corner of an office. Things quickly go sour for the young man and, at his lowest, he trips and gets separated from his googly-eyed spirit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">That is pretty much the crux of <em>SCHiM</em>: You’ve been separated from your human host, who is now meandering through the city oblivious to what was lost. Your goal is to give chase, navigating your way from shadow to shadow across levels with various hazards. It feels like an environmental puzzler, as you can find yourself needing to cross a street or get over a bridge by only using shadows to progress. </p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Most times, waiting for a few seconds will solve the issue with a passing human or animal. You can slip into the shadow of a cyclist or a car, which will either speed you closer to your destination if you time it right. Shadows from cars can also grab you and carry you away if you’re caught relaxing a bit too hard in the wrong spot.</p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">But the game isn’t frustrating with its challenges, which is the entire point. Its one-button approach to “solving” the navigational hazards makes moving your shadow frog from one end to another a rather cordial affair. At least, that’s what I picked up from the demo. Based on the game’s description on Steam, it doesn’t sound like <em>SCHiM </em>will ultimately venture into the waters of frustration often, if at all.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-clean-styles" data-injectable="false">Clean styles</h2> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true">It helps that the visuals are so crisp. Purposefully monotone, the game juxtaposes one color against a darker variant for texture, creating a look that’s clean and pleasing to the eye. The calming greens of a neighborhood park give way to a busy street punctuated by rain and light-blue hues. It’s all tied together with a soundtrack in which the tunes match the energy of each stage. </p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">I have little criticism to lobby against <em>SCHiM</em>. The controls are tight, and the visuals and music melt together to create a little puzzler that puts me right in that Zen state I was searching for. <em>SCHiM </em>will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch next month</a> on July 18. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Big Video Game Announcements Don’t Hit Like E3 Used To]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gears-of-war-fable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-big-video-game-announcements-don%E2%80%99t-hit-like-e3-used-to.902067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gears-of-war-fable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer (One Week) Of Video Games</a> has come and gone, and while companies like Microsoft brought out the big guns, it remains undeniable that Keigh-3 isn’t quite E3. What happened, though? Why does one showcase of shiny new triple-A games not feel as momentous as the other? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by some guy we know named Ethan Gach to discuss the aftermath (lol) of Summer Game Fest. Ethan was on the ground at the show in LA, so he fields questions about the experience of attending the show in person. We ultimately arrive at the same question people do after every single one of these things: Is an event like Summer Game Fest needed in a digital age where video game companies can spin up showcases whenever they want?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to our favorite games of the show, which consist of <em>Killer Bean</em>, <em>Doom</em>, and probably even a third thing. We also discuss a general feeling of malaise that hung over this year’s show. On one hand, Geoff and associated companies debuted some cool games, but it all felt so… expected. Where once the original <em>Fable </em>pioneered wild new ideas about what a game could be (even if it didn’t entirely stick the landing), the trailer for the latest installment is just a bunch of callbacks. It’s the natural endpoint of an industry obsessed with same-y safeness in pursuit of profit. Finally, we close out on a conversation about sending cats back in time, so you’ll definitely want to stick around for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can finally give the world the acorn tree-growing simulator Peter Molyneux promised us all those years ago.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> It’s funny for me seeing <em>Gears </em>in the showcase, and it being sort of a callback to that nostalgia for the characters and the series, but also what it meant when a new <em>Gears </em>came on the screen and you saw those characters. Versus now, it’s perfectly like what Luke was saying about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wolverine-crush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine looking at the photograph</a>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I guess that was my broader feeling, especially coming away from the Xbox showcase: I remember when a lot of these games and series <em>did </em>mean something. It felt so much more momentous when a new one was announced, or when one was announced at all. I mean, the whole thing about <em>Fable </em>when it was first announced was that it was this legitimate stab at something very new and ambitious. Whereas the new <em>Fable</em>, based on the trailer, feels like it’s just trying to hark back to a thing that we had before.</p><p>I guess that was sort of my bigger issue: Nothing I saw made me feel like ‘Man, those folks are just going for it’ outside a few of the indies. Most of the games just felt like another installment in whatever series. And I’m sure that they’ll be perfectly competently made – or made up to that exacting triple-A standard where each little individual portion of it is polished to a gleaming sheen, but the overall experience is like, yeah, I had a good enough time. Was it particularly memorable? Not really. But that was a fun way to kill 30-some-odd hours. I guess watching a procession of those things kind of leaves me feeling the same way I would after playing one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I’m trying to think of the other really ascendant franchises right now. Like, when CD Projekt Red is at a showcase, it’s a big deal. Maybe those sorts of things are on their off year right now. They’re out of cycle, and now it’s the bench of players who are aging out and should be just retiring. They’re trying to fill that space.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>It’s that wider sort of crisis in not just games, but a lot of cultural stuff, where they’re just so addicted to predictable, bankable IP that when you get to a show like this, it’s quite jarring when you think about how many of these games are just the sixth, eighth, tenth, twelfth entry in a franchise. When you talk about how we used to find E3 more exciting, a lot of those games made their debuts during those older E3s. <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> used to be a new and exciting game series. Now it’s on its god knows what – 15th, 16th game? I don’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>Every franchise that these studios peddle out – whether it’s a direct sequel or you do the Xbox route this year where it’s a sort of rebirth or revisiting of an older series – there’s none of that excitement that, Nathan, you were talking about earlier. There’s none of those groundbreaking, mind-blowing announcements, because you associate those announcements with being a major publisher or platform holder showing off something that’s brand new but is also the centerpiece of their offering for the next year or two.&nbsp;</p><p>PlayStation didn’t get up and show a brand-new, triple-A action adventure series. They played the hits. Even <em>Astro</em>, as cool as it looked, we kind of know it’s cool because we’ve played the demo that came with the PS5. It’s not new. And all the Xbox stuff was… like I said, I like the idea of revisiting old friends, but they’re old friends. There wasn’t much brand new there either. We talked about <em>Doom </em>being the third <em>Doom </em>game. That’s not the third <em>Doom </em>game. It’s, like, the eighth game in a series that’s 35 years old or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, that’s what’s really missing. And you don’t even blame Summer Game Fest. You don’t blame individual game studios. It’s just this wider cultural malaise we’re in where all these massive, multinational companies that control our cultural content are just so addicted to the IP and the predictability that comes with IP, because that creates dependable fiscal results. We watch a show like this and get left with this feeling of ‘Eh, that was cool, but it’s not as exciting as the rush you get when it’s a cool new idea.’ A big cool idea from a big company – that’s exciting. It’s left to those indie games to fill that space, which is admirable, but they can’t do it. They fill it to some extent, but it’s just not quite the same spectacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> And that’s like you saw at the beginning of the Summer Game Fest showcase when Geoff was, in his attempt to sort of acknowledge the weird state of the industry right now, holding up the top ten best sellers on Steam for the year – or maybe the month. But you see the games people have gotten really excited about this year, and they’re emergent games that are out, and either there’s a demo or the full thing is there and your friends are talking about it, whether it’s <em>Hades 2</em> or <em>Helldivers 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think partly at a lot of these companies, a lot of the money has been sucked up by forever games. It might be boring to see a reveal for a new <em>Apex Legends </em>character or <em>Valorant </em>coming to console, but they don’t need to keep showing stuff for that. They’re not gonna make a sequel. They’re making hundreds of millions per year, potentially. So there’s a black hole. Where before it used to be ‘We need to get a new <em>Gears </em>out every two to three years to make money,’ now that money has all gone to <em>Fortnite</em>, and you’re kinda left with these weird moonshots every once in a while – or just falling back on the old IP stuff. So I think part of it is that the money is not there behind the types of games you used to see at showcases like this.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and on top of that, another price of the many layoffs we’ve had not just this year but also last year and other years – and also various under-the-radar cancellations; you’ll see a sentence in an article that’s like ‘They canceled two or three in-development projects’ – is that you reach a year like this and there’s nothing really, truly new to show. All that stuff got canceled years ago. That is a larger problem. If you’re smothering all your babies in the cradle, then years later, you’re only gonna have the same stuff playing on repeat forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll only be able to bring two companions with you at a time, similar to the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, and fans are worried this might affect things like party banter, which has become a staple in the series. Busche explained that lowering the party count came hand-in-hand with a desire to bring everything in gameplay to a more intimate level, and that means commanding more party actions all at once.</p><p>“We just found that when you’re playing the combat system, when you’re planning your strategies, two really felt like the right number to manage,” she said. “So keep in mind, [protagonist] Rook has a lot of different types of actions, abilities, and individual attacks that are more fully fleshed out than ever before. Timing and positioning really matter a lot, so this really felt like the right balance. The number of inputs and actions we’re asking you as a player to take, including directing your companions, is higher than ever before. [...] I engage with the companions, [and] actively control what they’re doing more than I ever have before in any of the other three games.”</p><p>As far as banter goes, Epler said that <em>The Veilguard </em>will still include banter between companions as you travel through the world, even if fewer people are taking part in the conversation at once. He also confirmed that BioWare has gone out of its way to include features like resumable banter to ensure you don’t miss a conversation by accidentally triggering an event that interrupts it. While there will be interactions between characters during your travels, BioWare also confirmed there will be banter at your home base, so you’ll still get a sense of their relationships with one another if you don’t take them out to the field.</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t think you could stop the writers from writing banter,” Epler said. “I will say for myself it’s one of the more light but fun things to do. You get to write little stories and little arcs between different characters.”</p><h2 id="h175064"><a id=""></a><strong>You can kiss a skeleton, maybe?</strong></h2><p>Since it was revealed that Emmrich, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-emmrich-volkarin-romance-1851535012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-emmrich-volkarin-romance-1851535012">old man necromancer party member</a></span>, would have a skeletal assistant named Manfred, <em>Dragon Age </em>fans have, perhaps predictably, wondered if you can kiss the lipless man. Rhodes shot down any notion of a Manfred romance, but he seems to imply that you’ll be able to do…something….with a skeleton at some point in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“I would say, ‘not that skeleton,’ but we’re not saying ‘no skeletons,’” Rhodes responded to a fan asking to bone the bones.</p><h2 id="h175065"><a id=""></a><strong>There’s no photo mode...yet</strong></h2><p>BioWare has confirmed that <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t have a photo mode, but is open to adding it. This would be the second time the studio has such a feature to its games, as it included it in the <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em> remasters, but <em>Dragon Age </em>hasn’t had one yet.</p><p>“That is a feature that we like the idea of,” Rhodes said. “It’s not just player-facing, but internally it’s a really helpful thing for us as we’re building things out to have that. So we’ll let you know.”</p><figure id="" data-id="2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-recommend-id="image://2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A forest area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A forest area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-recommend-id="image://2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A forest area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h175066"><a id=""></a><strong>The ability wheel is a bit more limited this time around</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is using an ability wheel similar to <em>Mass Effect</em>, but it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to use every spell or ability in your arsenal from this. Instead, you’ll have to assign a loadout of three abilities per character in the party, and decide what moves you want to bring with you to the field. This is similar to <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which let you learn every ability in the game but were limited to three at a time unless you swapped your loadout. Previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games let you access most of your spells and abilities from a similar wheel without limitation.</p><p>“What I like about this is there is kind of an emergent gameplay depending on who you and your companions are coming into the mission with,” Busche said. “The reason for that is that it actually creates a really interesting balance of strategizing [...] about your combat kit before the mission. Then the tactical decisions once you’re in the field in combat deciding what to do.”</p><p>Other ability wheel inputs will include combat-based items that can buff your team, and an “ultimate” ability depending on your class and specialization.</p><h2 id="h175067"><a id=""></a><strong>BioWare will talk about accessibility features at a later date</strong></h2><p>One fan asked if BioWare would be including accessibility features in <em>The Veilguard </em>to help players who need those play the game. The question specifically mentioned an arachnophobia mode that would remove spiders from the game, which prompted Busche to mention her own fear of spiders. However, it sounds like BioWare will give this specific topic some attention somewhere down the line before the game launches in fall.</p><p>“I do want to assure you that we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this topic so you can play the game in a way that really works for you,” Busche said. “I’m excited to share that with you when the time is right.”</p><h2 id="h175068"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Veilguard </em>takes place ten years after <em>Inquisition</em></strong></h2><p>In the original gameplay reveal, Solas mentions that he and Varric worked together as part of the Inquisition “years” ago, and now we know exactly how long ago that was. According to Epler, <em>The Veilguard</em> takes place around 10 years after the events of <em>Inquisition</em>’s final <em>Trespasser</em> DLC.</p><h2 id="h175069"><a id=""></a><strong>You’ll be able to customize your party’s outfits</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>seems heavily influenced by <em>Dragon Age II</em> from its action-based combat to its free-for-all romance, but one thing it won’t be bringing back from the 2011 RPG is fixed party member appearances. Rhodes confirmed that while each companion will have a “wider range” of fits for you to find throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-recommend-id="image://132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-recommend-id="image://132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h175070"><a id=""></a><strong>The team is not focused on DLC at this time</strong></h2><p>Most of BioWare’s recent games (with the unfortunate exception of<em> Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>) have had major story DLCs. Busche said that right now ,the team’s entire focus is on the main <em>Veilguard</em> game and didn’t confirm or deny if the team would work on DLC after launch. She did, however, reiterate that it won’t have any microtransactions, battle passes, or online requirements.</p><h2 id="h175071"><a id=""></a><strong>There will be transmog</strong></h2><p>Busche confirmed that <em>The Veilguard </em>will have a transmog system so you can wear whatever you want while keeping the stats of stronger equipment.</p><h2 id="h175072"><a id=""></a><strong>There won’t be any asexual characters this time around</strong></h2><p>A fan asked if any characters in <em>The Veilguard </em>will be on the ace spectrum, and Busche said that while none of the companions will be asexual, she, as a gray asexual person, would like to include one down the line.</p><p>“None of our companions this time around are explicitly ace. When we look at the characters, their motivations, who they are, we always assess, ‘is this the right time?’ This time it wasn’t. But what I will say, for everyone on the ace spectrum out there, I would love to represent an ace relationship sometime in the future when it feels like the most authentic fit for a companion, when we can do it best.”</p><h2 id="h175073"><a id=""></a><strong>Blood mage will not be a specialization for Rook</strong></h2><p>While Busche didn’t specifically mention the other mage companions, she did confirm that Rook will have plot reasons for not practicing the controversial Blood Magic in <em>The Veilguard</em>. She didn’t get into specifics but did confirm that necromancy, elemental magic, and a more combat-based specialization are all on the table.</p><h2 id="h175074"><a id=""></a><strong>There will be no dog this time</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>had a canine companion in your party. That will not be the case in <em>The Veilguard </em>because the game takes place in northern Thedas, where the Mabari breed isn’t prominent. You can, however, pet Assan, Davrin’s griffon companion.</p><h2 id="h175075"><a id=""></a><strong>BioWare will show the character creator before launch</strong></h2><p>Having seen the character creator at Summer Game Fest, I can confirm <em>The Veilguard</em>’s character creator is easily the deepest one BioWare’s ever done. Busche confirmed BioWare will show it off publicly before launch in the fall.</p><h2 id="h175076"><a id=""></a><strong>Rook’s last name will be defined by their faction</strong></h2><p>Because you can play as so many different races in <em>Dragon Age</em>, player characters’ last names were often determined by race or backstory. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, Rook’s last name will be defined by which of the six factions you choose for them. Their first name will be customizable, however.</p><h2 id="h175077"><a id=""></a><strong>There will be a collector’s edition</strong></h2><p>While BioWare wasn’t able to talk about the different editions for <em>The Veilguard</em>, Epler said the team would talk about those “soon.”</p><figure id="" data-id="2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-recommend-id="image://2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A beach area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A beach area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-recommend-id="image://2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A beach area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h175078"><a id=""></a><strong>Tavern songs are back</strong></h2><p>One of the coolest worldbuilding bits in <em>Inquisition</em> were tavern songs performed by bards in Skyhold. Those will be returning in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Busche says one that is featured in a tavern called “The Swan” in the city of Minrathous is her favorite in the game.</p><h2 id="h175079"><a id=""></a><strong>Your party members can leave if you piss them off…but they might come back</strong></h2><p>In previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games, your companions could leave your party if they disapproved of your actions enough. It sounds like <em>The Veilguard </em>will have similar falling-outs, but it seems like some of them might not be permanent.</p><p>“You can piss them off, they might not agree with you, and they might take some time away,” she said. “That said, this is the biggest threat to Thedas we’ve ever seen, so they are always going to be willing to show up to defend Thedas, but yeah, you can piss them off and they’ll leave for a minute.”</p><h2 id="h175080"><a id=""></a><strong>If Rook dies, game over</strong></h2><p>In previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games, you’d shift control from one character to another if they died in combat. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll have to reload a save if Rook dies. That’s because you don’t get direct control of your companions this time around, but you can spec a party member to revive you to salvage a bad fight.</p><h2 id="h175081"><a id=""></a><strong>The Fade decision from <em>Inquisition </em>won’t be a factor in <em>The Veilguard</em></strong></h2><p>In <em>Inquisition </em>you had to choose between leaving either <em>Dragon Age II</em> protagonist Hawke or a Grey Warden leader in The Fade to help save the team from an ugly spider demon. Epler confirmed that this choice won’t play into <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story, but did say it might come up in a future game down the line.</p><h2 id="h175082"><a id=""></a><strong>There won’t be mounts this time around</strong></h2><p>Because <em>The Veilguard </em>isn’t open-world like <em>Inquisition</em>, you won’t be riding a horse in the new game. Rhodes explained mounts were meant to address a need that the studio no longer has this time around.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming this fall, so if you’ve not played these games before, you still have some time to catch up.

			<p>Wolfenstein developer MachineGames is known for their solid writing and penchant for diabolical nazi villains, which is probably what got them the gig making <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but they also just know how to make a good shooter. The Wolfenstein games deliver a lot of guns-blazing, gory action, so will their Indiana Jones game be the same?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. While being interviewed on the Official Xbox Podcast, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle director Jerk Gustafsson explained the goal is to make a “proper adventure game” that targets a “wider audience” than their previous hardcore shooters. As such, more often than not stealth and puzzle solving will be the best route forward, and when you do run afoul of the bad guys, you’ll frequently be punching them out instead of shooting them down.</p>
<p><em>“We're used to having these heavy weapons, gun-blazing shooters. This is a little big different. We are making a proper adventure game here, and it's also a game that is a little more directed at toward a wider audience, [which is] a bit of a new thing for us. </em></p>
<p><em>We prioritized that we had to stay true to Indy's personality, and who he is above all. He is a normal human being. He is not this caped superhero. He is flawed, he makes mistakes, he stumbles. There is weight to his movement and we have this gritty pulp edge to the action. But, at the same time, he's also rather athletic, he's an excellent fighter, and he has an enormous amount of luck as well. </em></p>
<p><em>It is something that we've been focused on a lot when it comes to gameplay. [Indy] solves problems with his mind first and really relies on smarts, not this excessive combat that we've seen or done before in the Wolfenstein games. So, when you are playing the game, choosing the more authentic stealth route, or just some classic fist fighting, will be a benefit to the player and, more times than not, also make for a very fun and challenging experience.”</em></p>
<p>The full Official Xbox Podcast interview is worth checking out, as the MachineGames guys get into a variety of topics, including the game’s locations (Marshall College, the Himalayas, Egypt, Thailand, the Vatican, and “a couple” of other locations), and the fact there will be a “couple” classic character cameos we haven’t seen yet. They also touch on the work they’ve done with Lucasfilm to ensure the game’s authenticity, Troy Baker’s work as Indy, and more. You can check it all out, below.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S on sometime in 2024. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-trailer-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the game’s latest trailer here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24178688/the-imaginary-review-studio-ponoc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="DgF39t"><small>This review of </small><small><em>The Imaginary </em></small><small>is timed to the film’s festival premiere at France’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival. The film will stream on Netflix in America starting on July 5.</small></p>
<p id="dW9XlZ">When Studio Ponoc’s first anime feature, <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em>, premiered in 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16358234/mary-and-the-witchs-flower-movie-review-anime-studio-ghibli-ponoc">it came as a relief</a> — a promise that the legacy of Japan’s famed animation powerhouse Studio Ghibli wouldn’t be entirely lost with Ghibli’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/4/5966439/studio-ghibli-shutting-down-restructuring-ni-no-kuni">rumored plans to shut down</a>. Founded by Ghibli veteran Yoshiaki Nishimura (producer of <em>When Marnie Was There</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275363/isao-takahata-studio-ghibli-animation-innovation-japanese-art-princess-kaguya"><em>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</em></a>), and taking on former Ghibli employees in an attempt to preserve their experience and skills for future animated projects, Ponoc came into the world openly billed as Ghibli’s successor. <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em> was so clearly modeled on Ghibli designs and storytelling that the transition seemed fait accompli.</p>
<p id="0znUkE">But Ghibli stayed in business, with co-founder Hayao Miyazaki laboring away on another animated feature, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review"><em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a>, while his son Goro experimented with digital animation to make the television movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22258621/earwig-and-the-witch-review-studio-ghibli"><em>Earwig and the Witch</em></a>. And Ponoc’s output has been slow over the past seven years, with no new feature films — just the charming shorts collection <em>Modest Heroes</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22590291/olympics-2021-anime-studio-ponoc-short-tomorrows-leaves">some lovely promotional projects</a>. So its new feature <em>The Imaginary</em> is a second round of relief for animation fans — both because the company is still in the moviemaking business, and because <em>The Imaginary</em> sees it just starting to edge away from outright Ghibli mimicry. (And, as a side note, because 2024 has been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177114/the-imaginary-netflix-release-date-studio-ponoc">a terrible year for cinematic imaginary friends</a> so far.)</p>

<p id="RpL5Uq"><em>The Imaginary </em>just debuted at France’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and comes to Netflix July 5 via an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24049777/studio-ponoc-the-imaginary-netflix-release-date">exclusive distribution deal</a>. Adapted from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-F-Harrold/dp/0802738117?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-F-Harrold/dp/0802738117?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23942729__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23942729__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">2014 novel by British author A.F. Harrold</a>, the film follows a spunky young girl named Amanda and her imaginary friend Rudger. (Not “Roger,” she and Rudger keep indignantly reminding people, but <em>Rudger</em>, which in Netflix’s dub and the kids’ posh British accents is pronounced pretty much the same way.) Rudger is a little blond boy who joins Amanda on all her imaginary adventures, and seems to regard her more like a playmate than a creator, though it’s notable that she occasionally treats him like a favored toy — something respected and beloved, but still capable of being banged about a bit for excitement and drama. </p>
<p id="2mtzNT">Amanda’s father has recently died, and while her mother, Elizabeth, has struggled to keep the family bookstore open, she’s ready to shut it down and move on to a more secure line of work. Elizabeth seems like a kind woman who’s a bit at the end of her rope, trying to deal with grief, a failing business, and a hyper kid who leaves messes behind because she has her head in the clouds, then blames them on her imaginary friend. Their dynamic feels notably like the <a href="https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-mom-biggest-freakouts/">frustrated family energy</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/5/13/21254476/calvin-and-hobbes-comic-strips-books-quarantine"><em>Calvin and Hobbes</em></a>: Elizabeth wants Amanda to pick up after herself and pay attention to her surroundings, while Amanda is distracted by the elaborate, adventurous worlds she’s creating. But where Hobbes’ relationship with Calvin’s mother mostly comes down to a minor frustration that she doesn’t make tuna fish sandwiches more often, Rudger has more melancholy longings. He thinks of Elizabeth as his mother, too, and wishes she could see and acknowledge him. </p>

<p id="tLbM7I">There’s a lot more <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> energy at play in <em>The Imaginary</em>: Like Bill Watterson’s comic-strip duo, Amanda and Rudger climb into a box and it suddenly becomes a vehicle flying through the air as the real world falls away. The games they play together are more real to them than anything else in the world, and their partnership is more vivid and crucial than Amanda’s other friendships.</p>
<p id="xe6aHf">The movie’s most exciting, most visually exalted sequences come whenever the story enters the imagination realm, where form is fleeting and fluid. People, objects, and settings all transform on a whim, and the possibilities seem limitless. Ghibli animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271278/spirited-away-watch-best-studio-ghibli-movie"><em>Spirited Away</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21275119/porco-rosso-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-ending"><em>Porco Rosso</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart"><em>Whisper of the Heart</em></a>) directs the film with the kind of dedication to shape-shifting and symbolic shifting <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/832-the-gross-fluids-and-clean-fluidity-of-spirited-aw/">Hayao Miyazaki brings to his best movies</a>. (<em>Millennium Actress</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24173761/scavengers-reign-influences-inspirations-more-like-shows-miyazaki"><em>Paprika</em></a>, and <em>Perfect Blue</em> director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/30/20836173/perfect-blue-satoshi-kon-explained">Satoshi Kon</a> made a similar fluidity of form a signature in his movies, but usually with a conscious aggression and sense of nightmare threat instead of Miyazaki’s and Momose’s expression of bouncy joy.)</p>
<p id="NafmE4">But where Miyazaki movies <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21269323/castle-in-the-sky-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki-villains-explained">generally avoid outright villains</a>, <em>The Imaginary</em> has a particularly compelling and present threat. There are plenty of Miyazaki-style emotional stakes as well — Rudger, like other imaginary friends, is in danger of fading away if Amanda isn’t focused on him, and he gets to see firsthand what happens to “imaginaries” whose children die, grow up, or move on. But <em>The Imaginary</em> compounds the danger with an actual villain, who’s better discovered than described, and who brings an old-school sense of gleeful, gloating wrongdoing to the movie, alongside all its sunny explorations of children’s adventures in the worlds they create.</p>

</p>
<p id="ZztERr"><em>The Imaginary</em>’s animation still shows plenty of Ghibli influence, from the overstuffed, painterly rooms packed with gleamingly detailed objects to the way characters cry, with rivers of outsized, glutinous tears pumping down their faces in messy rivers. In close-ups, when experiencing big emotions, Amanda and Rudger look very much like off-brand Ghibli characters, just a touch off-model. But Ponoc’s film is edging toward its own look as well — a softer, more painterly color scheme, thinner lines and flatter colors, and character designs a little closer to Toho-Towa’s 1989 international release <em>Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</em> than to any specific Ghibli movie.</p>
<p id="5XGmQq">And Ponoc’s film also feels like it’s aimed more firmly at younger viewers than most of Ghibli’s work. The screen is frequently filled with high-energy bustle, as Rudger meets an entire colony of displaced Imaginaries or the story heads inside a different kid’s imagination. But the story itself is fairly simple and straightforward, exploring feelings of pain, loss, and fear in the Pixar mode. There are a couple of authentically scary moments, but mostly, the film keeps a kid-forward outlook, where children face the perils and solve the problems adults are oblivious to, and playtime frequently takes center stage.</p>
<p id="t9BrTu"><em>The Imaginary</em> isn’t as visually or narratively rich as <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em>, or as transcendent as Miyazaki projects like <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>. But it does feel like a move in the right direction for Ponoc, an effort at finding its own voice and its own footing. It may not be remembered decades from now with the same fond fervor as Ghibli’s early projects, but if Ponoc keeps experimenting and keeps branching out, it might well be remembered as the first step toward forming its own distinctive creative legacy, and stepping out from under Ghibli’s shadow. In the meantime, it’s a giddily thrilling experience for young anime fans, a movie aimed at visualizing what it feels like to daydream as a kid, to enter a world of absolute imagination where everything else falls away. </p>

<p data-characters="309" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players have successfully rescued a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-latest-mo-forcing-players-to-choose-between-anti-tank-mines-and-saving-sick-kids-is-going-as-well-as-you-imagine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital full of sick children</a>, rather than unlocking a mine Stratagem. Wow, after typing that out, it really wasn’t much of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfspv6/isnt_that_sweet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moral dilemma</a> after all. Arrowhead is celebrating by donating to charity, while hinting that players can still earn the mines. </p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">The donation news reached divers <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801603873502638151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via a message</a> dropped by CCO Johan Pilestedt on X. Following the liberation of Vernen Wells, Arrowhead Games donated $4,311 to Save the Children. </p> <figure data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">For those wondering, 4,311 looks like “HELL” when punched into a calculator. It’s also the number of kids rescued from the in-game hospital. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The donation to Save the Children was warmly embraced by many members of the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, some of whom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfs2ln/operation_save_the_children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also donated</a> to the foundation not long after hearing the notice. Another member suggested a new cape to celebrate the victory. I have to put my vote in for the one below, for hitting me right in the nostalgia.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-players-get-one-more-shot-at-earning-the-mines-stratagem" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players get one more shot at earning the mines Stratagem</h2> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">Even though <em>Helldivers 2</em> players opted to save Vernen Wells over Marfark, the Major Order still has less than a day before ending — as of this writing. When asked, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801625047418667450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pilestedt confirmed</a> that players can still earn the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines Stratagem so long as they can liberate Marfark in the small window of time. Apparently, the game’s DM Joel said “they never will,” which sounds to me like a challenge.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You will!</p><p>Joel said. If the community does both "which they never will", they'll get both.</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1801625047418667450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players in the community have quickly turned their gaze to Marfark in hopes that they can earn the Stratagem before it slips through their fingers for the third time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="false">I have a feeling that if players fail to earn the Stratagem again, it probably won’t be the last it gets dangled in their faces. At this point, divers unable to unlock the Anti-Tank Mines have become something of an inside joke, possibly to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfttao/well_unlock_them_eventually/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chagrin of the devs</a> who worked on the Stratagem. There’s always next time. Maybe.</p>

It claims those disputes will be processed by Asus’ own staff rather than outsourced customer support agents.</p><div><p>And, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader">failing to even acknowledge the ROG Ally handheld’s SD card reader issues</a> for over a year, the company will be finally be issuing a formal statement about the defect next week, <em>Gamers Nexus</em> is reporting.</p></div><p>One month ago, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7pMrssIrKcY"><em>GN </em>revealed</a> that Asus could in some instances charge customers for unwanted and unneeded repairs, among other issues. Following the company’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DI3DwhTc7Z4o">tone-deaf response</a> to that investigation and additional pressure by the YouTube channel, Asus customer support higherups sat down face to face with <em>GN</em> this week. </p><p>Here’s the list of concrete promises that resulted from that sitdown, according to <em>GN:</em></p><div><blockquote><p>ASUS now has a new inbox called “<a href="mailto:executivecare@asus.com">executivecare@asus.com</a>” that they have created specifically to re-process prior RMAs that customers feel were unfairly classified, were misclassified, or charged for a service that should be free</p><p>ASUS has published a timeline for improvements: June 14th, today, is the publication of this email and template. ASUS has promised us an email this month with other changes.</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunds of service charges for unnecessary repairs which customers felt compelled to accept in order to have a warranted repair covered, such as unrelated or misclassified CID [Customer Induced Damage]</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunding shipping charges in scenarios where a warranted repair was part of the RMA. For clarity, if a customer has both an out-of-warranty repair and an in-warranty repair in the same claim, shipping will be covered by ASUS</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunding labor and taxes related to these aforementioned qualifying disputes</p><p>ASUS has created a Task Force team to retroactively go back through a long history of customer surveys that were negative to try and fix the issues</p><p>ASUS has removed the power from the repair centers to claim CID. Now, CID claims must go through ASUS’ team. This will remove some of the financial incentive to fail devices. There still is one, but now it won’t be motivated as much by speed</p><p>ASUS is creating a new support center in the US. This will enable customers to choose between a repair of their board or a faster swap with a refurbished board. This solves an issue where refurbs were the only option in some scenarios previously</p><p>After over a year of refusing to acknowledge the microSD card reader failures on the ROG Ally, ASUS will be posting a formal statement next week about the defect, resulting from this series</p><p>ASUS will publish a more transparent repair report template in September of 2024</p><p>ASUS is changing the Advance RMA language to reduce emphasis on physical damage</p></blockquote></div><p>Also, here’s an email template you can use when emailing that executivecare@asus.com address, as provided by Asus itself:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Your Name (as listed in your RMA):&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>RMA Number:</em></p><p><em>Serial Number:</em></p><p><em>RMA application country:</em></p><p><em>Please describe your previous RMA dispute:</em></p><p><em>Supporting Documents (e.g., charged invoice, quotation notification, photos):</em></p><p><em>Additional Feedback (optional):</em></p></blockquote></div><p>Asus says it should respond to emails sent to that address within a week. </p><p>The company is also apologizing today for previous experiences you might have had with repairs. “We’re very sorry to anyone who has had a negative experience with our service team. We appreciate your feedback and giving us a chance to make amends.”</p><p><em>Gamers Nexus</em> says it’s not taking Asus at its word. “[W]e already have devices in their RMA centers under pseudonyms and plan to continue sampling them over the next 6-12 months so we can ensure these are permanent improvements,” writes editor-in-chief Steve Burke.</p><p>Asus had previously laid out a handful of promised customer support improvements <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fsite%2Fsupportupdates">at this link</a> (pdf).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Yacht Club Games just announced a new mainline game in the hit series that started as a retro-inspired 2D platformer, and the studio says this new game will “launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming,” <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/what-s-next-for-shovel-knight/">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough of a clue about the move to 3D, the Yacht Club Games’ Friday livestream celebrating the 10th anniversary of <em>Shovel Knight</em> featured an even more pointed hint: a 3D version of the Yacht Club Games logo.</p><p>The studio is staying mum about many specifics — there’s no release window — but did tease that “the game will bring electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a <em>Shovel Knight</em> title.” </p><p>While you wait for that new game, Yacht Club Games will have a lot of new things you can play. The studio also <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-shovel-of-hope-dx-announcement/">announced <em>Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</em></a>, the “definitive edition” of the original <em>Shovel Knight</em> title that adds things like online multiplayer, stereoscopic 3D, a rewind power, in-game cheats, and the ability to play as 20 different Shovel Knight characters. Yacht Club Games says the game is “coming soon.” <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-dig-wicked-wishes-launches-summer-2024/"><em>Shovel Knight Dig</em></a> and <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-pocket-dungeon-paradox-pack-releases-summer-2024/"><em>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon</em></a> are also getting free DLC this summer. </p><p>The developer also shared <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db5MbAFiFlOA">new footage of <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>, its upcoming game that looks to be heavily inspired by the Game Boy classic <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Mina</em> also has a vague “coming soon” launch date, and I look forward to a more specific release window — the game looks fantastic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m guessing this isn’t an easy feat. Just getting them all in there to begin with sounds hard enough. And then you have to carry all that weight and plastic on your chest while trying to look normal. I’m not sure I could do it. And I guess neither could the woman caught by Chinese officials. </p><p><strong> .</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">A lot has changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>. Among some of the changes that will affect your game as you grind toward high-level content is how Exotic armors are divvied out going forward. The old way of unlocking new Exotics, by playing through Lost Sectors, is over. Instead, you'll need to earn reputation with Rahool, the Tower Cryptarch, if you want access to those spiffy new armor pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's a quick rundown of how Exotic armor works now, how things have changed, and what it'll take to rank up with Rahool enough to get access to his new wares.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Out_With_The_Lost_Sectors">Out With The Lost Sectors</h2><p dir="ltr">Destiny 2 has added a lot of new Exotic armors over the last few years, and The Final Shape has two new armor pieces for each character class. You can earn one of them by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-campaign-missions-list-and-how-long-to-beat/1100-6524012/" data-ref-id="1100-6524012">completing The Final Shape's Legend campaign</a>, but the other will remain locked until you either complete the campaign again, or gain access to a new brand of Exotic focusing: Tier 3 focusing.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, to gain new Exotic armor, the trick was to complete the daily, rotating Lost Sector on Legend or Master difficulty. Each day featured a different kind of armor, so if you were missing an Exotic helmet from your collection, you'd wait for the head armor day to come around and play through the Lost Sector until you got the helmet you wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">From now on, though, that method is over--while the daily Legend/Master Lost Sector still rotates around the map, it no longer drops a specific type of Exotic armor. You can still play Legend and Master Lost Sectors to earn high-end materials and Exotic engrams, but you won't earn any specific Exotic armor from them.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Rahool_For_All_your_Exotic_Armor">Visit Rahool For All your Exotic Armor</h2><p dir="ltr">Instead, apart from what you get from the campaign or specific Exotic missions, all new Exotic armor pieces go through Rahool. He's the guy who decrypts Exotic and Prime Engrams for you in the Tower. Rahool now has a reputation system, so the more Engrams you decode, the more points you get, unlocking rewards along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Rahool also offered "Focusing" services that let you pick what piece of Exotic armor you would get out of an Exotic Engram. You had three options: You could decrypt the Exotic Engram normally and get a random piece of armor at no cost other than spending the Engram; you could focus the decryption on a specific expansion or seasonal release to narrow the random pool down to just a few Exotic armors, but at a cost of Glimmer and Enhancement Prisms (called Tier 1 Focusing); or you could pick the specific piece of armor you wanted, if you were willing to pay more Glimmer and Ascendant Shards (called Tier 2 Focusing).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319626" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319626"></a><figcaption>Tier 3 Focused Decoding, otherwise called Novel Decryption, lets you buy any Exotic armor in the game as long as you have an Engram and an Exotic Cipher.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With The Final Shape, Rahool adds Tier 3 Focusing, which allows you to buy "novel" pieces of Exotic armor to add to your Collections tab. These will cost you one Exotic Engram as well as an Exotic Cipher, which you can earn from ranking up with Rahool or from Xur when he shows up each weekend. Xur will offer you an Exotic Cipher quest so you can earn one each week, and you'll get another for resetting his reputation rank. There are also a small number of Exotic Ciphers available as rank rewards on the Season Pass. You can hold up to five in your inventory.</p><p dir="ltr">All that said, you don't start with access to Tier 3 Focusing--you have to reach Rank 17 with Rahool in order to unlock it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Increase_Your_Cryptarch_Rank">How To Increase Your Cryptarch Rank</h2><p dir="ltr">This part's easy, although it can be either time-consuming or expensive. To increase your rank with Rahool, all you need to do is decrypt Engrams. The more specific your decryption, the more reputation points you earn for each one, so Tier 2 decryption gets you the most points (500), Tier 1 decryption gets you a little less, decrypting an Exotic Engram drops it even more, and decrypting a Prime Engram gets you the least.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to rank up quickly, then, you should knock out some Tier 2 Focusing decryptions. These can get expensive in a hurry, but they will rank you up <em>fast</em>--many of the Cryptarch ranks are only a few hundred points, and even at the top end, ranks cost around 800 points, so you can climb this in minutes if you have materials and Engrams stockpiled.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you reach the top of the reputation ranks for Rahool, Tier 3 Focusing unlocks for all your characters, and you no longer have to worry about it. You'll now be able to purchase new Exotic armors, including the ones from The Final Shape's Legend campaign, as long as you have Engrams and Exotic Ciphers.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape guides hub</a> for many more answers about what's new in Destiny 2, and read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a> while you're at it.</p>

<p data-characters="220" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ysyNfkYWGW4?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yacht Club Presents</a> stream, Yacht Club has announced the <a href="https://youtu.be/raR31fIgTPY?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next DLC update</a> for <em>Shovel Knight Dig</em>. The <em>Wicked Wishes </em>DLC is free and will arrive alongside a slew of balance and bug fixes sometime this Summer.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The <em>Wicked Wishes</em> expansion has you enter Hoofman’s Guild Hall to rub elbows with other elite adventurers and rise in their ranks. It includes new missions and challenges, relics and buffs, bosses and music; the whole nine. If you’re unfamiliar, <em>Shovel Knight Dig</em> is the roguelite spinoff to 2014’s <em>Shovel Knight</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Shovel Knight Dig Wicked Wishes DLC Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raR31fIgTPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="118" data-injectable="false">I don’t mean to tease, but on the stream, they refer to the additional challenges as “rip-roaring.” It’s cute.</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Alongside the DLC, they’re also promising over 100 bug fixes, a rebalanced algorithm, and localization fixes. Considering that quite a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shovel-knight-dig-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few player complaints</a> seem to be just about things that need to be tightened, rebalanced, or tweaked, hopefully, this will be exactly what the game needs.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Yacht Club is also saying that this will be the last updated for <em>Shovel Knight Dig</em>. They’re putting a ribbon on it and calling it done. Or however that saying goes. To top things off, they’re releasing ports for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="false"><em>Shovel Knight Dig</em> is currently available for Switch, PC, and mobile platforms. The <em>Wicked Wishes</em> DLC and PS5 and Xbox Series X|S version are aiming for this summer.</p>

<p data-characters="381" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A world with rival houses, big medieval battles, court intrigue, and dragons is undisputedly a fantastic setting for a board game. Many publishers have created tie-ins with both the <em>Game of Thrones </em>TV show and the <em>Song of Ice and Fire </em>book series to bring the stories of Westeros to the game night table. Some of these iterations are quite good, and others are downright fantastic.</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">To celebrate the start of <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 this weekend, we’re counting down the best <em>Game of Thrones</em> card and board games. Each of these games is a fun way to transport yourself back to Westeros, without having to relive the pain of <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 8.</p> <h2 id="h-6-a-game-of-thrones-b-twixt" data-injectable="false"><strong><a href="https://geni.us/8esdum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>6.

 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/8esdum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>A Game of Thrones: B’twixt</em> </a>is a relatively straightforward party game with a healthy dose of strategy, particularly when it comes to outbidding other players for cards. You’ll need to collect a cast of iconic characters from the books for each of the two councils you have in your play space, which are in part shared with the players to your immediate right and left. The player with the most powerful small council wins the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-word-meeple-is-being-trademarked-in-the-us.901968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/word-meeple-is-being-trademarked-in-us<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The word meeple refers to a certain game piece in the tabletop community. A tiny, stylized, painted, wooden human-shaped figure. They can be used in worker placement games or even rolled in games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/meeple-rolling-board-game-rolling-heights-reaches-to-skies-of-kickstarter"><em>Rolling Heights</em></a>. And a German publisher is going to trademark the term in the US.</p>
<h2>The Meeple Trademark situation</h2>
<p>For context, the reason for the meeple trademark is due to a crowdfunding campaign. According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/06/14/the-word-meeple-is-being-trademarked-in-the-us-in-reaction-to-cease-and-desist-activity-from-carcassonne-publisher-hans-im-glueck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BoardGameWire</a>, a Gamefound campaign called <em>Meeple Inc.</em> was successfully funded in March. It was developed by Cogito Ergo Meeple and successfully raised about $230,000.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-inc-meeple-game-board-set-up.jpg?itok=am1vwwr7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-inc-meeple-game-board-set-up.jpg?itok=S0ZCmJqt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank goodness some slight changes in terms happened.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the game and the publisher has undergone rebranding. The project is now called <em>Tabletop Inc</em> and studio's new title is Cotswold Games. This is because they were sent a letter on the behalf of <em>Carcassonne</em> publisher Hans Im Glueck requesting the project be removed.</p>
<p>This is because Hans Im Glueck owns the German and European trademarks for the word meeple across various use cases. including the classic meeple figure from the 2000 release of <em>Carcassonne</em>.</p>
<p>Tabletop Inc,'s designers, Joe and Maddie Adams, wrote a campaign update about the meeple trademark stating they were, "a little surprised as the term is used so frequently in the hobby."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We thought Meeples belonged to all board gamers, it appears they don’t. We of course have zero interest in using anyone else’s IP so we think the best option is to do as they ask.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, whilst it creates a fair amount of work for us in the short term, this will not affect the game very much – all gameplay will remain exactly the same and the artwork will only be changed to replace the meeples with our new characters… Mumans.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation has lead to similar reactions in the greater tabletop community. It is a widely used term in the hobby and this trademark hasn't been heavily enforced in the past. As such, a US trademark application for the word meeple has been sent by Board Games Insider podcast co-host Corey Thompson and GenCon Event Manager Marian McBride.</p>
<p>Thompson went on record saying he and McBride have no plans to make any profit from doing this. Stating, "“The side effect of this is that we intend to protect the US trademark from predatory action. We would really love for the wordmark to be usable by anyone.”</p>
<p>Overall, it's a forward-thinking legal move. Over the years, dozens of board games have been released featuring the word meeple. Which means if Hans Im Glueck were to become more aggressive with enforcing their trademark, it could mean a lot of messy legal action in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/survival-fountain-of-youth-review-%E2%80%94-a-journey-through-a-timeless-legend.901965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/survival-fountain-of-youth-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tale of the fountain of youth is one passed down through the generations. Magical water that can stop and even reverse aging, allowing one to live forever. This is the foundational narrative for&nbsp;<em>Survival: Fountain of Youth.</em>&nbsp;Mixing the story of Juan Ponce de Leon with exploration focused quests and survival mechanics has produced an entertaining indie title.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Take to the Seas in<em> Survival: Fountain of Youth</em>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Washed ashore a small island after the destruction of your ship, you find yourself without any recent memory. Your aim is to travel throughout the four regions and reach the Bimini Belt where the fountain of youth is rumored to be hidden while tracking down the crews of the other two ships and Ponce de Leon.</p>
<p>Travelling throughout the regions you'll be managing hunger and thirst. This means finding fresh water and building ways to cook food. You'll also need to craft vessels capable of navigating between the islands and ultimately make it through the turbulent waters of the Bimini Belt.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-island-of-hope-statue.jpg?itok=agw3a4za 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-island-of-hope-statue.jpg?itok=ZkL7tV-n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The hardest part of surviving the islands is not dying to the creatures, especially if you don't focus on acquiring large amounts of ore to craft advanced weapons. Perfecting blocking helps, but ranged weapons are the way to prevent taking damage. Melee against crocodiles or bosses can quickly rack up the death count. With limited <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5f26e7e5-15f8-46f9-9955-1771d0b9e223" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-fountain-of-youth-living-water-locations-map-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Living Water</a> to remove max help debuffs, not dying in the first place is a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Quest Driven Narrative</h2>
<p>While there are survival and crafting mechanics in&nbsp;<em>Survival: Fountain of Youth,</em>&nbsp;they aren't the strongest part of the game. The quests and the lore they impart on the player are. Each quest reveals a part of Ponce de Leon's journey through the area in his quest for the fountain. They expand to the fates of your fellow sailors and launch a nefarious plot that you must unravel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the quests are the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1536a34d-cb93-427d-80e2-84225e3b86d1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-fountain-of-youth-chronicles-locations-map-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chronicles</a> hidden in each region. When found, each Chronicle details the history of the Bimini tribes and their fate. You even get to meet one member of the Snake Tribe towards the end of the game. These pieces of lore solidify the world you playing in.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-iron-island-chronicle.jpg?itok=m31jIMGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-iron-island-chronicle.jpg?itok=p3RBozNs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Unfortunately, since it is so quest-driven, additional playthroughs are heavily discounted. I couldn't see myself playing through the title a second time as the story has a definite ending, and any surprise the plot threw at you are no longer impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Base building in <em>Survival: Fountain of Youth</em> is sparse, with decor primarily centered on hunting trophies and some nautical items. Personally, it doesn't provide enough of a draw for repeated playthroughs. What kept me going through the game to reach the end was the want to find out who you're actually playing as and if the fountain is real.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the lack of creative base mechanics, there's really no innovation when it comes to crafting. You have a smoker and a campfire, a tanner, and farms. While there are game-specific crafters, such as the saltpeter, there's nothing unique about the implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-alcohol-crafting-recipe.jpg?itok=V8ANU-aR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-fountainofyouth-alcohol-crafting-recipe.jpg?itok=fJ1dWxGx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Survival: Fountain of Youth</em>&nbsp;presents a compelling narrative, it's a standard survival crafting game that borders on an RPG. The story is well executed and entertaining, but many of the title's mechanics offer nothing new to the genre. After an initial playthrough, while being provided many hours of entertainment, I wouldn't be amenable to a second save.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Survival: Fountain of Youth is a creative take of the story of Juan Ponce de Leon, but more RPG than survival crafting game. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

Exotic missions have come and gone to much acclaim, such as The Whisper and Zero Hour (which returned to the game via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918"><em>Into The Ligh</em></a></span><em>t </em>some months ago), but Dual Destiny is the first one to have a real gimmick outside of a timer and some light puzzling. Dual Destiny can only be completed by two players, requires them to adorn certain subclasses—one Dark, one Light—and demands a certain amount of communication. The reward at the end is pretty significant: an Exotic class item that can roll multiple perks, including ones previously accessible via class-specific equipment, meaning <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-subclass-prismatic-dread-1851398657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-subclass-prismatic-dread-1851398657">classes can now share abilities</a></span> with one another.</p><p>That’s a pretty game-changing incentive to complete what appears at first glance like a neat, but missable mission, and players are a bit incensed about the requirements to acquire such a transformative piece of equipment. Fans of <em>Destiny 2</em> have gotten upset about secret Exotic missions like this before, because of their difficulty or the timed nature of them, but the ire around Dual Destiny is entirely different. There’s a guaranteed way to make the mission appear , meaning you can only miss out on it by failing to commit to the process, at which point you should know what you’re getting into.. Folks who play <em>Destiny 2 </em>simply don’t want to have to do this mission with another player in order to get the Exotic class item, and they’ve been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ddwyub/i_love_the_dual_destiny_mission_itself_but_i_feel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ddwyub/i_love_the_dual_destiny_mission_itself_but_i_feel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very loud about it</a></span>.<br></p><p>I totally understand disgruntled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-server-error-offline-1851523773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-server-error-offline-1851523773">solo players</a></span>. I’ve been playing <em>Destiny </em>for all ten years it’s been around, and I’ve largely played the game solo. I’ve never had a <em>Destiny </em>static (a reliable group of folks to play with) and probably won’t for a while still. There are six-player raids and three-man dungeons I <em>still </em>haven’t completed, and yes, I’m occasionally upset about the fact that I haven’t been able to experience some of the game’s best content due to lacking a fireteam. Even now, I’m not stoked that such a pivotal item is locked behind a quest I need to find someone else to complete, but believe it or not folks, this is not Bungie’s problem. It’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/rocketbiscuits/status/1800942292041072859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/rocketbiscuits/status/1800942292041072859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mine, or yours</a></span>.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>has always been a multiplayer-first game. Even if large chunks of it can be completed solo, it’s entirely valid for the developer of a <em>multiplayer</em> title to make content specifically for audiences to engage with it on those terms. I don’t think the game needs to cater to an audience that wants to turn it into something it isn’t.</p><p>Not to mention, <em>Destiny</em>, as well as its community, have largely circumvented the issue at the heart of this situation. There are numerous forums and Discords where people can meet other players to play with. Over the years, I’ve met at least a couple of friends through <em>Destiny </em>like this. Nowadays, there’s a full-fledged system in the game called Fireteam Finder that allows you to make or search for posts in lieu of matchmaking, and while it’s far from perfect, it is largely functional. Find a lone player, get on the mic for about half an hour to communicate some puzzles to one another, and then complete the mission and move on. It is actually as simple as that. It is a mission like any other, and when there’s a challenge in front of you, the goal is to overcome it.</p><p>As someone who’s got anxiety about playing games with literally anyone other than the friends I’ve played with for years, I understand how engaging in these systems may be asking a lot of certain folks. I’m sympathetic to the person who’s riddled with second thoughts and doubts about putting themselves out there, but I’m also not going to enable them to remain closed off. Nor am I going to join the chorus of players demanding that missions like Dual Destiny never be made in the first place because it chafes against what they believe should be allowed.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>has always excelled when it’s pushed itself and the people who play it. Without the kind of experimentation on display in Dual Destiny, we wouldn’t have much of its best content, which includes the numerous secret Exotic missions over the years, every Raid, and the game’s dungeons, which are my personal favorite. We wouldn’t have all of the community-based ARGs that the <em>Destiny </em>community has been privy to over the years. There’s simply so much we’d be missing if Bungie didn’t occasionally ask its players to come together for unique experiences. My advice is to lean into it the few times it happens. I don’t think you’ll regret it.</p><p>Inevitably, Bungie will introduce an alternative way of getting the Exotic class items that isn’t tied to Dual Destiny. This was never going to be the <em>only </em>method to get them, it was just an interesting and novel way to handle things, while also testing the functionality of Bungie’s new services and the willingness of its community. It’s been heartening watching folks give it a try despite hang ups and disabilities, such as some Guardians who are either <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1de3dq6/fellow_mute_guardians_you_can_complete_dual/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1de3dq6/fellow_mute_guardians_you_can_complete_dual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mute</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dec81o/dual_destiny_is_genuinely_great_fun_and_highly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dec81o/dual_destiny_is_genuinely_great_fun_and_highly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deaf</a></span>. Though the <em>Destiny </em>community can be as toxic as any, seeing many offer to carry communication-averse players, or those who simply aren’t comfortable with the more involved mechanics of the encounter, is a reminder that these communal experiences <em>are </em>worth having in these games.<br></p><p>I hope Bungie takes that to heart. I’ve no doubt there’s reasonable criticism to be made about Dual Destiny, but its existence is actually one of the best things about games like <em>Destiny 2</em>. It is hardly a problem that needs expunging. Rather, it’s a promise of what the game can look like when it and its team are allowed to fire on all cylinders, and continue to create novel experiences for this community all these years later.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The E3 replacement included multiple online showcases and onsite events, each aimed at drumming up excitement for a flood of upcoming games. Which games rocked? Which ones sucked? Which ones will become video game industry touchstones while the rest fade from memory? We tried to play as many of them as we could to find out.<br></p><p>After flying back from LA, throwing all our dirty laundry in the corner, and passing out, we started gathering every single game we got a chance to actually go hands-on with during Summer Game Fest, from <em>Marvel Rivals</em> to <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, and all of the indies in-between. In some cases, we only got mere minutes with the the games as their developers and brand managers pitched us on what made them great. But for other games, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, we were able to roam new worlds at our leisure and chew on them for a while. </p><p>We saw loud monster truck races, real-time strategy battles, Souls-likes, sidescrollers, hotly anticipated <em>Overwatch</em> knockoffs, and much, much more. Every game we got a chance to try out is here for your perusal, along with details on where they’ll launch and when. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC </p><p>Amazon Games’ <em>New World</em> has had an interesting few years. Billed as an MMORPG and launched in 2021 on PC, it’s now being repackaged and re-released as <em>New World: Aeternum </em>for a console drop. Weirdly, Amazon is also shifting the marketing approach for <em>New World: Aeternum</em>: it has all of the base game material, the <em>Rise of the Angry Earth e</em>xpansion, and a slew of new content—and the team is calling it an RPG, not an MMO, even though it’s still an MMO. Yes, I am also confused.</p><p><em>Aeternum</em> clearly wants to court new players while also attempting to not alienate the exist fan base, but I’m not sure how well this will work out. My hands-on was fairly brief, but showed off the new story content and new characters. At first, the RPG elements were obvious—there’s a cool story at play here, your build can be varied, your approach diverse, but then after getting through the on-boarding process, it hard-pivots back to an MMO. And a kind of boring one at that.</p><p>If you already play <em>New World</em>, you won’t be annoyed by the tedious crafting and leveling that comes standard with an MMO. But if you haven’t (and that’s clearly who Amazon is trying to court here), why the hell would you sign up for an RPG just to play this? If the full game launch is more fleshed out in terms of solo gameplay that isn’t as tedious, <em>New World: Aeternum </em>could be a solid RPG. We’ll have to wait and see. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Early Access July 30</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>If you loved <em>StarCraft II</em> you’ll probably like <em>Stormgate</em>, a real-time strategy revival project led by some ex-Blizzard developers. It’s free-to-play with an emphasis on 1v1 competitive modes, though additional content and campaign missions will be available in the paid version. The team recently revealed its third faction called the Celestials which turn the traditional resource extraction, base expansion, army creation loop on its head due to an intricate set of mechanics that allow players to explore, expand, and attack all at once.</p><p>I was able to demo the game ahead of the event and chat with the team at Summer Game Fest and it looks good and plays great. I’m still not sold on if it can break out beyond the hardcore, esports-minded crowd it’s initially pitched at, but it’s snappy, matches are quick, and I’m excited to play more. I never got into <em>StarCraft</em> but love the genre, and have been on the hunt for an old-school RTS that can fill that void in my life. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> fans, we are so back. After playing half a dozen matches against AI-opponents, I can’t wait to get my hands on <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and relive all of my favorite DBZ highs and lows while getting ultra sweaty online, if the netcode allows it. It sucks that local versus is limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber but it’s better than none at all. I have a sneaking suspicion that I’ll find plenty of things to complain about once I’ve spent dozens of hours with the finished game, but that’s also part of the <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> legacy. A flawless series it was not, but what I saw of <em>Sparking Zero </em>made it feel like Bandai Namco is serious about making it more than just a next-gen nostalgia cash-in. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>Hands-On: Shaping Up To Be The <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3 </em>Sequel Fans Deserve</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 29, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>The newest game in the <em>Monster Jam </em>series, <em>Showdown</em> is exactly what it says on the label: you drive around massive monster trucks across several different game modes and three major locations. There are 1v1 races, traditional multi-truck races, and a destruction mode that rewards you for—you guessed it—demolishing shit.</p><p>During my Summer Game Fest hands-on, I struggled a bit with steering my monster truck, and flipped over <em>a lot</em>. Luckily, there’s a simple “respawn” button that blinks you back a few feet and sits you upright, but I did not do well in any of my races because I couldn’t keep the damn thing from tipping over. I was told that I could use the right joystick to better control my truck, as <em>Showdown</em> has independent suspension, but that just made me even wobblier.</p><p>I can see <em>Monster Jam Showdown</em> being a fun game to pick up and play with friends while having a few brewskis, and for fans of the series, this will probably satisfy them, but this isn’t really my jam. Teehee. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>TBD (beta this summer)</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>Battle Aces</em> is another RTS led by ex-Blizzard developers. You might have caught it during the Summer Game Fest showcase where it debuted with a flashy anime trailer that set many viewers up for crushing disappointment when the words “real-time strategy” eventually followed. But <em>Battle Aces</em> isn’t your standard RTS. It’s much closer to something like <em>Clash Royale</em>, the mobile deck-building tower-defense game.</p><p>In<em> Battle Aces</em> you unlock new units, build a “deck” out of the ones you want,” and then go into battle against opponents on a super small map where matches are only expected to take about five minutes or so. Resource extraction is all automated outside of investing in a limited set of additional base nodes, and building units is almost instantaneous. Where the strategy comes in is trying to counter-play against your opponent’s army, capitalize on big swings to cripple their resource extraction, and incrementally build up advantages until you crush their final base <em>Dota-2</em> style. As with <em>Stormgate</em>, competitive play isn’t where my RTS love lies, but<em> Battle Aces </em>felt approachable and low commitment enough to peak my interest once it’s out. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date</strong>: July 19, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, PC</p><p>I love tower defense. I love Capcom action games. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> combines the two into a Japanese folklore-inspired adventure where you guide a maiden from one demonic gate to another across a mountain until all of the evil spirits have been banished. It was one of the best demos I played at Summer Game Fest, and luckily most players won’t have to take a risk on buying it to find out what’s so special about it since it’s coming to Game Pass. As someone who put dozens of hours into the original <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>, I’m so glad tower defense sickos are about to get what feels like a big-budget action strategy game with some of the visual flair of <em>Okami</em>. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can't Wait To Return To&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can't Wait To Return To"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</em> Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can’t Wait To Return To</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>I am very much not an RTS person, so perhaps I won’t do <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>justice, and for that, I’m sorry. But even I can understand the excitement around <em>Retold</em>’s release, as it’s finally bringing back a 22-year-old RTS classic with modern graphics, improved mechanics, and a chance to fight through Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons. And instead of having just swords, shields, spears, and other typical classic RTS weapons to fight with, you’ll get some sick powers as well: Zeus’ lightning, a barrage of meteors, dragons, centaurs, crocodiles, cyclops—you name it, <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>probably has it.</p><p>During my playthrough, I quickly picked up on some of the hotkeys to make this RTS really sing, like selecting the entirety of my troops in one click so I could direct them to destroy an enemy stronghold, or pressing F3 to heal everyone in the vicinity. There is a zen-like appeal to RTS games that my hands-on has allowed me to understand, and I zone out almost immediately. Before I know it, the preview is over. A rep for the dev team said that the goal with <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>was to attract non-RTS players, and it could very well do that—it’s available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Series X/S and PC. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 16 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I played<em> Flock</em> for about 15 minutes and in that time I discovered six new specimens of exotic indie game creatures and managed to get four of them to follow me back to my quest giver. Think <em>Pokémon Snap </em>mixed with a chill flight sim. I’m not sure how much deeper the game will go, but I enjoyed spotting new, weird little animals and guessing what they were based on their appearance and behaviors. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em> is a game about taking pictures, I think. It doesn’t really tell you want to do, which is good because I was happy to just spend my time walking around mountain paths like I was on a hike. There’s an incredible soundtrack of chill licensed tracks that made me feel oddly meditative. The first-person view made me a little motion sick, but I did not expect any of my demos at Summer Game Fest to lead me down a trippy trance of existential reflection. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>TBD</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I did not like <em>Bounty Star</em> at all for the first eight minutes or so, which involved a tutorial of walking around a ranch following glowing markers and making items like I was trapped inside a survival crafting sim. Then I got into an actual mech and fought through my first mission and fell in love with the crunch robot combat. Getting hit felt a little wishy-washy and there’s a lot of room to improve on the overall look and level of polish, but I could definitely see getting hooked on a <em>Borderlands</em>-style loot loop of blowing up bandits and customizing my mech. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Early 2025</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Mac</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is like <em>Overwatch</em> if it snorted a line of adderall off the TTRPG table in a comic book store. The free-to-play superhero PvP shooter aims to fill a gap left by Blizzard’s struggling hero shooter, and boasts a massive cast that will only get bigger, but it’s unclear if this will strike the right cord. There are so many aspects of this that feel directly lifted from <em>Overwatch</em>—Doctor Strange wields a shield like Reinhardt, The Punisher has a turret form like Bastion, Luna Snow can send heals across the map to a single teammate like Zenyatta. Hell, even the modes are similar, with opposing teams either fighting to maintain control over an area or one squad attempting to escort a hi-pri mobile object across a map.</p><p>But there is just <em>so much going on</em> that it’s immediately overwhelming. The roster is huge, the voice lines are constant, the colorful explosions and flashes of light as every Marvel hero fires off their abilities makes matches hard to read with all the visual noise. I only had a little bit of time with <em>Rivals</em> (back-to-back Summer Game Fest appointments that almost all run over make for an intense experience), but it took me more than half of my appointment to get a feel for everything. By the time I did, I was quite good at Luna Snow, who felt like the perfect character for me, a perpetual support player (though I did notice that NetEase and Marvel Games had to scrape the bottom of the hero barrel for a solid support character, as Luna was introduced into Marvel canon via the mobile game <em>Marvel Future Fight</em>).</p><p>I’m not sure if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will have any legs. <em>Overwatch </em>has, indeed, left a gap in the hero shooter market, but <em>Rivals</em> feels clunkier, busier, and less inspired than Blizzard’s hero shooter once was. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>If you liked <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, don’t sleep on<em> Robots at Midnight</em>. It’s another action-RPG Souls-lite that takes the edge off punishing combat with cartoony robot enemies and a whimsical world. In addition to the standard stamina bar and dodge roll, there’s also an air dash that lets you quickly retreat from combat. I still got my ass-kicked, especially at night when, as the title implies, the stakes ramp up with extra and tougher enemies. I enjoyed what I played and it’s definitely on my radar now. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Sky of Tides</em> is a narrative-driven sci-fi game where you try to navigate a world torn apart by revolutionary politics and heal its divides. There’s a slick-looking series of animated shorts attached to it that expand on the story, while the game itself was described to me by one of its developers as an “anti-RPG.” Instead of trying to min-max stats and role-play as a particular character, your aim is to progress by building stats and choosing dialogue responses that help your character grow in a balanced way. It’s an interesting idea though I’m not sure how compelling it will be in practice. Still, it’s the most interesting approach to subverting the traditional CRPG structure I’ve heard of since <em>Disco Elysium</em>. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>What if <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was a survival crafting game that looked (even more) like <em>Princess Mononoke</em>? You might get something like <em>Fera: The Sundered Tribes</em>, a gorgeous and ambitious looking sandbox monster fighter where you can hookshot and paraglide around a massive map. It’s a huge pivot from Massive Damage’s last game, the pixel-art strategy roguelite, <em>Star Renegade</em>. The world looked really cool even if the game felt a bit messy to control at times and very chaotic during boss fights. It’s a tall order for the studio to pull off, but if it can it could be a really fascinating addition to the exploding (and quickly overheating) survival crafting genre. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I’m by no means an old-school <em>Fatal Fury</em> head or a  fighting game aficionado but I liked what I played of <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>. Like, a lot. It’s definitely not as approachable as <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, but it certainly feels like that’s where part of SNK’s attention is in brining the direct sequel to 1999's <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em> into the world of 3D animations. There’s even a new simpler control scheme you can select that makes pulling off super moves a lot easier, even if some of the full-gage attacks are still locked behind some intricate manual button presses. </p><p>A lot of the tactics revolve around cancelable “Rev” moves and defensive advances that make City of the Wolves reward skilled and cautious play. Mostly I just had a ton of fun beating up on CPU opponents as Preecha, a brand-new addition to the SNK roster and a  Muay Thai fighter who brings a bubblier energy to the brooding dude-fest. Everyone should have “their” fighting game and I think I’m not determined to make <em>Fatal Fury </em>mine. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 19, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, PC</p><p>I will admit to approaching this hands-on with a heavy amount of bias. <em>Enotria</em> is an Italian folklore-inspired Soulslike from a small team of nine people based in Milan, Italy, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/colin-farrell-penguin-show-hbox-max-set-pics-1850213829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/colin-farrell-penguin-show-hbox-max-set-pics-1850213829">I love Italian shit</a></span>. </p><p>I spent about half an hour with <em>Enotria</em>, and boy, did I struggle. The developer on-hand promised me that the team will be making it more accessible for launch, as it absolutely whooped my ass, but I enjoyed every second of it. The beautifully vibrant, over-the-top world and all its Italian influences (from the music to the bosses, like the multi-faced, batshit worshiper Vermiglio the Red Prior) were a delight to behold, even if I had to get help beating every one of the demo’s bosses.</p><p>And while <em>Enotria</em> feels and behaves a lot like a <em>Souls</em> game, Jyamma Games has gone to great lengths to add layers of customization that might surprise you. You can set up three loadouts and swap between them on the fly and apply aspects to the masks you wear that will adjust your stats and give you certain buffs and debuffs. There’s a lot going on under the hood here, which is really impressive considering how small the dev team is! — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> has never looked so good or featured Shadow as a playable character. That’s the long and short of my take-away from the remaster of the PS3/Xbox 360 era action platformer. I will say that the linear 3D spin on the speedster’s traditional formula has aged remarkably well, and feels focused and even somewhat fresh in comparison to a lot of the genre-scrambling bloat we sometimes see these days. Game was good. Game still good. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Switch, Mobile (Netflix exclusive), PC</p><p>No gaming expo is complete without that one puzzle game that lowkey scrambles your brain and blows your mind after just a few minutes with it. For me this year that was <em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em>, a beautifully illustrated top-down adventure where you maneuver through mazes by sliding their tilesets. It’s simple at first, but the gimmick quickly reveals clever tricks and unexpected challenges. It was made by a surprisingly large team of over a dozen people, one of whom was the artist on indie darling <em>Braid</em>. There’s a bit of how <em>Crypt of the Necrodancer</em> was remixing<em> Zelda </em>for music junkies, except this time around it’s puzzle logic sickos who are benefiting. It was another one of my top demos from Summer Game Fest. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 16, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>This is probably the most beautiful game I played at Summer Game Fest. Animated with a lithographic style and set music that oozes neo-noir vibes, <em>Phoenix Springs </em>has you point-and-clicking through objects in the environment for clues about your missing brother. As a reporter, you try to tease out information from strangers and uncover the tools needed to progress by chaining together nouns. Instead of building up an inventory of stuff, you collect ideas that can be combined to initiate new interactions or strings of dialogue that advance the plot. As someone who doesn’t really gel with point-and-click adventure games, I wish there was another way to play through <em>Phoenix Springs</em>’ world and story, but both of them were irresistible enough that I am going to struggle through it regardless when it eventually comes out. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><em>Replaced</em> is an ‘80s homage that feels like <em>The Lost Boys </em>met <em>The Warriors</em> in an arcade cabinet. The 2.5D cyberpunk platformer tells the story of R.E.A.C.H., an AI that was trapped in a human body and is now on the run through a dystopian world marred by corruption and littered with outlaws. I didn’t get a huge taste of what <em>Replaced</em>’s combat will be like in my half-hour demo (I got a gun towards the end of my playthrough, which I could charge up by using my melee ability to whack baddies), but I was immediately entranced by its set-dressing.</p><p>Though <em>Replaced</em>’s graphics are hyper-pixelated and decidedly retro, small details like flickering light particles, incredible audio design, and seamless transitions from side-scrolling movement to animated cutscenes adds a slightly modern twist. At one point, when I’m prompted to access my inventory, the camera zooms in on R.E.A.C.H.’s back and then through it for a tight shot of his “Wingman,” an obvious spin on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walkman retro music player</a></span>. This game is <em>beautiful</em> from top to bottom, and my brief demo left me wanting a whole lot more. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 18, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>UFO50</em> is the latest game from <em>Spelunky</em> maker Mossmouth and one fans have been waiting a while for. The title refers to a collection of 50 retro-inspired games built from the ground up to look and feel like a library of long-lost NES cartridges. I tried to flip through as many as possible in my short 10 minutes with the game, and found an RPG in the vein of<em> Dragon Quest</em>, a beat-em-up reminiscent of <em>Double Dragon</em>, and a space golfing game that is unlike anything I’ve played before.</p><p>There’s local co-op and a meta-story that runs through each game about the fictional company that made them. None of the ones I came across seemed like something I might end up spending hours playing, but I’m excited to dig into the full collection and pretend I’m back in my neighbor’s basement grinding through the same five games we had lying around over and over again because we were too poor to buy more. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2025</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>While Waiting</em> is what it says on the tin. The game is on a timer and will automatically move along from one day-in-the-life-style vignette to another. What you do while waiting for each new scene to arrive is up to you. Most of it consists of making messes, annoying people, or making up imaginary games to play with yourself like pretending your finger is a spaceship dodging asteroids as you move it along a window pain as rain drops run down it. It’s a clever idea with a perfectly suited visual style and lots of hidden achievements to collect. — Ethan<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 5, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>People have been waiting a very long time for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-s-delay-is-personally-painful-because-1848362882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-s-delay-is-personally-painful-because-1848362882"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>.</a></span> The immersive FPS from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-russia-invasion-ukraine-release-date-delay-1849061092&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-russia-invasion-ukraine-release-date-delay-1849061092">Ukrainian studio GSC Game World</a></span> was delayed in 2022, when the team had to flee their country after it came under siege by Russia.

After several delays, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>is set to launch this fall, and I got a chance to try out a demo build at Summer Game Fest. Though my build wouldn’t let me invert my Y-axis and I embarrassed myself in front of Phil Spencer (who was behind me while I wheeled the camera about wildly trying to unlearn years of inversion-brain), it’s clear that GSC has made something special.</p><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>looks incredible. The game world is incredibly dark, not so much so that you can’t clearly see where you’re going, but just enough that the bizarre electrical anomalies chasing you through a sewer will overwhelm you and make a scary situation even more terrifying. Then there’s the resource management, which you’ll quickly learn is crucial if you’re going to make it through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Enemies are smart and painful, ammo dwindles fast, radiation poisoning stacks quickly, and you can very easily get over-encumbered with shit. You need to have your head on straight to succeed in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2</em>, as it offers a level of immersive FPS that surprised me. This game is going to be brutally fun when it launches in the fall, and it’s an instant cop for me (though it’ll be day one on Xbox Game Pass). — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Q3 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC</p><p><em>After Love EP</em> is an adventure game where your dead girlfriend talks to you as you explore and try to recover from the grief of her passing. There’s rhythm gameplay when you’re jamming with your band, which I didn’t get to play, but the other part of the game is navigating conversations with friends and the daily toil of living in a beautiful, bustling part of Jakarta, Indonesia. The game is partly a tribute to <em>Coffee Talk</em> creator Mohammad Fahmi, and based on his work before passing away at the age of 32 a couple years ago. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Q1 2025<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>Play as a house, roll around lo-fi PS1-looking environments, flirt with other buildings. That’s the crux of<em> Building Relationships</em>, an indie game from a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ttanatb/status/1799230341594673575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ttanatb/status/1799230341594673575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single developer</a></span> named Tanat Boozayaangool. The part I like best is how all of the dialogue feels like someone downloaded their messiest group chats and text message threads and boiled them down into the funniest moments. It’s deeply personal but with the breezy nonchalance of a modern online dating profile. Boozayaangool said it’s about two hours and was partly inspired by the brief meditative journey<em> A Short Hike</em>. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 29, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>fans, rejoice, <em>Akimbot</em> is coming later this summer and bringing with it a whole shoebox full of love letters addressed to the PlayStation platformer. Evil Raptor, the team behind the <em>MediEvil</em>-inspired <em>Pumpkin Jack</em>, has proven once again that they can take a winning formula, replicate it, and add some extra toppings to sweeten the deal. <em>Akimbot</em> follows two robots, Exe and Shipset, who have just escaped the clutches of the Roboglioni mafia family and are on the run from the very Italian-coded ‘bots (they even wear funny little old-school hats).</p><p>The platforming is incredibly fluid and seamless, with a double-jump and dash allowing you to move through the beachy environment with relative ease. It’s simplistic, but effective, and the level design feels like it’s gently nudging you in a direction rather than strapping you to rails. Combat is similarly simple: Exe can melee enemies with a blade, shoot them with an AR, and pick from one of four special attacks from a merchant I encountered almost immediately in my demo. You’ll need some firepower here, too, as one set piece where a giant, turreted ship rained hell down upon me was quite difficult.</p><p><em>Akimbot </em>is fast and fun, and feels like the perfect game for <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>fans looking for some light platforming, fluid combat, and an unlikely duo leading the way. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Late 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p><em>Shantae</em> maker Wayforward has teamed up with Atari to bring back <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>, a 1980s space shooter that was one of the best selling games on the Atari 2600. <em>Yars Risin</em>g tries to build that out into a <em>Mega Man Zero</em>-style action platformer with hacking mini-games (the developers really didn’t want me to call them that) where you complete challenges modeled after the gameplay of the original. It’s a neat homage that I didn’t feel any particular attachment to, especially because the presentation of <em>Yars Rising</em> feels quite distinct from its ‘80s source material. It certainly doesn’t seem like a bad game but I’d need more time with it to have a sense of whether it’s more than just a competent exercise in brand revival. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 6, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>was hands-down the best thing I played at Summer Game Fest. It is more<em> Astro Bot</em>, but it is not <em>only</em> more <em>Astro Bot</em>. I recently described it to someone as PlayStation’s version of a Nintendo game except that unlike a lot of those it doesn’t feel like it was trying to copy anyone’s homework. The platforming is tight, the secrets on each level are delightful, and challenge levels made me sweat just enough to want to keep coming back. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387">Hands-On With <em>Astro Bot</em>: Pure Joy</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Holiday 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Switch, PC</p><p>If you’ve played one of the many recent licensed Lego games you’ll know exactly what to expect from <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>. It’s retelling the events of the <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in a slightly different and much funnier way, and prioritizes two-player co-op with streamlined controls and straightforward combat. It reminded me a lot of <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em>, which is excellent. Hopefully there’s enough meat on the <em>Horizon Adventures</em> bone to make it feel similarly fulfilling. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713">Hands-On With Horizon Lego Adventures: A Perfect Fit For Nintendo Switch</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 30, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5</p><p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894">hands-on with Ubisoft’s upcoming open-world game, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span>. I hoped that it would showcase a beautiful <em>Star Wars</em> world, and that it would play nothing like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>—and I was pleasantly surprised. Though my demo was on rails, it’s clear that there will be a variety of gameplay options and features at protagonist Kay Vess’ disposal, from blaster gunfights to stealth options to leaning on her sidekick, Nix, to distract Stormtroopers or fetch objects. There’s hacking, lock picking, dogfights in space, sabacc matches, and more.<br></p><p>The world Ubisoft has crafted is steeped in reverence for George Lucas’ galaxy, and Kay is a fantastic protagonist, a loveable scoundrel who feels rooted in <em>Star Wars</em>’ seedy criminal underbelly. I wish I could have gotten a feel for just how open this game will be when it launches later this summer, but from what I did get a taste of, I am hungry for more. — Alyssa</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Hands-On: Good Gameplay, Wonderful World</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>June 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch<br></p><p>What can I say? It’s more <em>Super Monkey Ball,</em> folks, just with a lot of additional bells and whistles this time around. The game did not visually look that great running on Switch, though maybe that’s because it was blown up on a massive Samsung TV. The gameplay was decent and I never felt like I was slipping off stages or floating in the air for too long (the Sega rep told me there was a conscious effort to make the controls weightier this time around following some complaints about the recent remaster of the original games).</p><p>Did I mention you can play as Sonic? He, Knuckles, and the rest of the gang are part of a season pass players can pick up to expand their roster of characters, and a lot of the push behind the game seems to be inspired by things like<em> Fall Guys</em>, including a multiplayer mode featuring 16-player activities. There’s also a spin-dash move this time around that lets you store up momentum and fling your monkey around like a pinball. It was perfect for trying to cheese levels. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Fall 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Mac</p><p>This ‘90s-inspired low-fi horror game from a two-person development team (Cozy Game Pals) was so vibey when it first launched, Blumhouse Games noticed it and offered money to expand upon it. <em>Fear The Spotlight</em> will return to Steam (and other platforms), later this year, and if you’re interested in vibey, VHS-quality visuals and creepy liminal spaces, I highly recommend it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fear-the-spotlight-blumhouse-horror-game-hands-on-1851528992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fear-the-spotlight-blumhouse-horror-game-hands-on-1851528992">My hands-on with <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> </a></span>was an incredibly gripping and satisfying experience, like playing through an old point-and-click PC game with a throwback <em>Resident Evil </em>twist.

The S-Game project promising a 30 hour campaign with tons of different weapons and exploration looks years away still, but what I played much more like a PS3-era action game. Cool combos and flashy animations, complete with long range attacks and parrying. It didn’t blow me but I’m interested to see what the rest of the game ends up looking like once it exists. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 11, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC</p><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>wasn’t quite what I was expecting. I went into my demo thinking it would have more real-time action flavor, but it is very much <em>Persona</em> in a fantasy setting. There’s a calendar system and social interactions to build deeper relationships with your party (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">but no romances</a></span>), and transformations in battle to cast spells or use extra powerful attacks that feel a lot like summoning <em>Persona</em> in suits of armor.</p><p>You can perform attacks out in the world, but only against weaker enemies. The stronger ones still require a familiar turn-based battle to defeat. None of this is bad. In fact, with <em>Persona 6</em> nowhere in sight at the moment, Atlus RPG fans are lucky to have something so meaty and stylish to dive into this fall. I was just hoping to see the formula shaken up more. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> plays like a great, if conservative, <em>Persona </em>spiritual spin-off. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 8, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p>The newest side-scrolling robot tactics game from Thunderful Development was my final appointment at Summer Game Fest 2024. I felt completely dead while sinking back into the blue couch I was sitting on for the demo, but not so dead that I didn’t immediately get stoked for the new possibilities coming in the sequel. The first <em>SteamWorld Heis</em>t was XCOM in 2D, with players lining up ricocheting bullets and collecting rewards from surviving successful battles.</p><p><em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em> doesn’t change what’s not broken, but it does add some big twists. There’s now overworld exploration via a submarine you can upgrade and battle other ocean enemies with in real-time. Each character can also train in various classes and share abilities between them similar to the job systems popularized in Final Fantasy Tactics and other strategy RPGs. The result seems like a much deeper tactical experience that I’m really looking forward to checking out the full version of when it drops later this summer. — Ethan</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can also opt to turn off <strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong> or <strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong>, but <strong>I’d personally leave these on</strong>. There’s no compelling performance gains by disabling them.</p><p>That said, <strong>if you have the Steam Deck hooked up to a Monitor or TV, you can increase the game’s resolution to enjoy some superior visuals</strong>. To do this, before you select the “Play” option on the game’s main page, press <strong>the Cog icon</strong> on the right side of the screen (pictured above), then select <strong>Properties &gt; General &gt; Game Resolution</strong>. Here you can manually select what resolution the game will launch in, even if it’s past the Steam Deck’s default resolution. <strong>The resolution in-game needs to match whatever you select here, so make sure to review the Graphics settings in the Options menu to make sure everything is in order.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-recommend-id="image://c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-recommend-id="image://c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Based on my testing experience, here’s how the game runs at the following resolutions:</p><p><strong>1368 X 768</strong>: This is, for the most part, just a clean visual upgrade. The game typically ran between 55 - 60 FPS, and did not meaningfully dip below 50. It’s not a big graphical boost, but it’s “free” if you’re on a TV.</p><p><strong>1600 X 900</strong>: I found this to be a good, balanced option. The game typically maintained a resolution above 50 FPS, with only an occasional dip below that. If you’re not particularly sensitive to frame rate issues, this should look good and feel smooth.</p><p><strong>1920 X 1080</strong>: Believe it or not, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>generally runs okay at 1920 X 1080! You’ll spend more time in the 40 FPS range, with occasional drops below that. However, the game was still perfectly playable and never dipped below 30.</p><p><strong>I personally preferred playing at 1600 X 900</strong>, but your mileage may vary. Some areas of the game may be more taxing than others, so you may need to adjust the resolution depending on where you’re at. Either way, the Steam Deck’s performance is leaps and bounds superior to the Nintendo Switch version, so keep that in mind as you select which version of the game you’d wish to play. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware is preparing to bring players the highly anticipated first and last DLC for Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, on June 21, 2024. Just a week before the DLC drops, the developers have announced an exciting upcoming patch that will introduce new features for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, along with bug fixes and balance adjustments. The latest patch will be released on June 20, with server maintenance scheduled for 7:00 to 10:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree patch is designed with players in mind, introducing inventory features to help you better manage your items. Any new item you obtain will be marked with a ‘!’ so you can spot them more easily on the menu. Also, a new tab called ‘Recent Items’ will be available for all your recently acquired items to sit.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the new Summoning Pool features, players have received more control over the tools. Active Summoning Pools are now available in New Game Plus. In the upcoming patch, you will be able to enable or disable individual summoning pools through the new Map Functions Menu. Lastly, the Small Golden Effigy will allow you to select only Active Summoning Pools.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree patch will bring exciting new customization options for players. Among these additions are five fresh hairstyles that will be made available. These new styles can be accessed through the character creation section using either the Clouded Mirror Stand or Rennala’s Rebirth feature. Furthermore, FromSoftware has announced that they will introduce even more features as the update nears its release.&nbsp;</p>
