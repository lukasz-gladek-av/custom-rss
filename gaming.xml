			<p>The latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-pc-ray-tracing/">major update</a> for GTA Online has been released and is now available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The update is called Agents of Sabotage. There is plenty of content to get stuck into in this new update, with the Darnell Bros Garment Factory being a major focus for the update. To be able to get started with this mission, answer Pavel's call, then take a trip to the Garment Factory in east Los Santos. Alternatively, you can use the Maze Bank Foreclosures in-game website to get started. When you arrive, you'll notice that the Garment Factory has a Mk II Weapon Workshop, Personal Quarters, a passive income safe, ten Personal Vehicle storage slots, and much more to make this HQ yours to enjoy.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA Online: Agents of Sabotage Now Available" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YW9VXUgoG6w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with this is The FIB Files, which is a set of four new multi-stage endeavors, where players are tasked with taking down an IAA-protected aircraft while stealing military tech from Fort Zancudo, participating in a break-in to recover missing artwork, and getting access to Maze Bank's secret slush fund. Players will be able to participate in these missions once they've introduced themselves to the necessary NPCs in the factory space. You'll also need the Darnell Inc. app installed on your iFruit, which will then give you access to The FIB Files.</p>
<p>While these are the main focuses of the Agents of Sabotage update, there are also new vehicles for you to enjoy. This includes the Banshee GTS (free to claim for GTA+ Members through January 8), Chavos V6, Dinka Jester RR Widebody, as well as law enforcement versions of the Canis Terminus Patrol and Vapid Caracara Pursuit.</p>
<p>Jodi is now able to add several new upgrades to the Benefactor Terrorbyte, which is now also able to be stored inside the Garment Factory thanks to the latest update. By teaming up with Jodi, Bureau Tech allows you to have exclusive mods to the Terrorbyte, which can make undertaking certain missions easier, as well as avoiding the attacks of other players. This includes a Collectible Scanner, which will alert you to Playing Cards, Action Figures, Movie Props, and more. The Terrorbyte will now also be able to have a Missile Lock-On Jammer, which prevents other players from locking on to the vehicle. This has added compatibility with 50 popular vehicles in the game.</p>
<p>For more information about what the Agents of Sabotage update has in store for GTA Online, you can check out the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/399a19ka9935ok/gta-online-agents-of-sabotage-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newswire on the Rockstar Games</a> website, which goes into some of the finer details of the major update for the game, as well as providing some screenshots of cosmetics that you'll be able to obtain in the new update.</p>

Annette’s feelings seem reasonable considering how Erzsebet’s right hand woman Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson) is back in action despite appearing to be killed by Alucard (James Callis) in <em>Nocturne</em>’s first season. But with Alucard now working with Richter Belmont (Edward Bluemel), Richter’s grandfather Juste (Iain Glen), and a hardened Maria Renard (Pixie Davies), the vampires won’t exactly have an easy time plunging the world into darkness.</p><p>The trailer features a handful of shots — Maria is <em>finally </em>going to summon <a href="https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon">her dragon</a> — that make <em>Nocturne</em>’s second season look like it’s trying to top the first in terms of utterly batshit action. And while the trailer doesn’t exactly spell out just what Erzsebet’s up to this time around, we won’t have to wait long to find out for ourselves because <em>Castlevania: Nocturne </em>is set to return on January 16th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I feel guilty about comparing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a> to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 
</p>
<p>
Being a "true" 3D real-time space strategy game, it looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nebulous-fleet-command-is-the-hardcore-version-of-homeworld-i-didnt-know-i-wanted">barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship</a>, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.

Slated to arrive 10th January 2025, the Carrier update "adds a completely new dimension to the game's approach to hard sci-fi space warfare", according to Rear Admiral John F. Press Release. Yes, they're being metaphorical: the game hasn't gone 4D, though I really wouldn't put it past this developer to start dabbling in non-Euclidean geometry.
</p><p>
"The titular Carriers arrive in the form of both dedicated hulls and self-contained modules for existing hulls for both the game's factions, and with them come launchable craft across a range of archetypes," Rear Admiral John F. Press Release continues, with his trademark gravelly brusqueness. "Each faction gets three unique spaceframes, with a seventh spaceframe representing a shared design. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether you're deploying scouts, missile bombers, utility craft, or Top Gun-style fighters, each spaceframe is customizable via the dedicated in-game editor. Craft can also have multiple customizable loadouts as well, which can be selected and refitted should players need to switch up their tactics mid-battle."
</p>
<p>
The update will accompany a "barrage" of complementary changes, including rebalanced ship weapons and defences, anti-fighter missile tech, and unguided cluster bombs and rockets.</p>
<p>Nebulous: Fleet Command is currently shy a final release date. I think what I'd most like right now is a proper story mode with a hefty tutorial component - the early access version currently promises "a singleplayer campaign mode involving a persistent fleet, narrative thread, and objectives". Give me a 20 hour yarn dedicated to fleshing out the intricacies, because it feels like there's brilliance at work here, for those brave or mad enough to commit.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there's always - shudder - the multiplayer. You can follow Fleet Command's early access development via the developers' <a href="https://trello.com/b/ZNxJIGSQ/nebulous-public-roadmap">public trello</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mongolian-cs2-team-makes-history-at-shanghai-major/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At the Perfect World Shanghai Major, a Mongolian Counter-Strike 2 team is doing the unthinkable. The MongolZ have accomplished a feat that no other team from the Asia region has ever done before, in a manner that no team in the world has done in more than half a decade.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks prior, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mongolz-wins-thunderpick-world-championship/">The MongolZ claimed their largest prize pool winnings ever</a> at the Thunderpick World Championship. But something even more unimaginable is still possible for them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-job-s-not-done">Job’s Not Done</h2>



<p>By qualifying for the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, The MongolZ became the first Asian Counter-Strike team to do so in Major history. Dating back to 2013, the playoff field has always been dominated by European teams, with one or two North and South American teams sneaking in regularly. Asian teams typically compete alongside Oceanic teams in Major qualifiers, but in the rare occasions were an Asia-Pacific team reaches playoffs, it’s always been an Australian roster until now.</p>



<p>The fashion in which The MongolZ reached the playoffs is also a historical feat. The Major utilizes two 16-team Swiss stages to determine who goes to playoffs. The MongolZ went 3-0 in both the Opening Stage and the Elimination Stage, beating the likes of Heroic, GamerLegion, MOUZ, and G2 Esports. The last time a team went 3-0 in two Swiss Stages at the same Major was at the FACEIT London Major in 2018, when Team Liquid accomplished that feat. G2 did it as well at the ELEAGUE Boston Major prior, which was the first Major to utilize the two Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fittingly, The MongolZ made playoffs at the first Counter-Strike Major to be held in Asia. The team’s 19-year-old rising star Sodbayar “⁠Techno⁠” Munkhbold <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40498/techno-on-playing-in-front-of-the-asian-crowd-its-a-big-advantage-for-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the crowd has been “a big advantage”</a> for the team. That advantage should increase as the event transitions over to the larger Shanghai Oriental Sports Center for playoffs.</p>



<p>Do you have The MongolZ going all the way in your pick ‘ems? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-focuses-on-customization-and-expressing-yourself/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-focuses-on-customization-and-%E2%80%9Cexpressing-yourself%E2%80%9D.1057002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-focuses-on-customization-and-expressing-yourself/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CD Projekt Red has announced full details for Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2. Releasing Today (December 10), Update 2.2 is known as the “Express Yourself” patch that adds a number of capabilities for players in areas such as car customization, photo mode, and character creator. </p>



<p>The update is available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Starting with car customization, players will now be able  to update more cars with more colors and designs. There’s also a new “Twintone” feature that allows players to scan any car in the world, and transfer the scheme and color over to their own vehicle. Lastly, in regard to vehicles, Johnny Silverhand can now be a passenger in  your car.</p>



<p>With Photo mode, the developers have added a number of new options for players including a new drone mode that allows for more range and movement when setting up a photo. There are also new lighting updates along with the ability to add up to three NPCs to  your photo. Once you’re happy with your pictures, you can hang them in your apartment or upload them to a gallery for other players to see.</p>



<p>The game’s character creator has been updated to include over 100 new assets as well as a complete character randomizer. There were also updates that the team didn’t want to talk about during the reveal stream. </p>



<p>The full patch notes are available via <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/update-2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While players will no doubt be a bit disappointed to not get any PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements or a New Game+, the additional customization features should breath some extra life into the four-year-old game. </p>



<p>With Update 2.2, CD Projekt Red didn’t confirm that this will be the final update for Cyberpunk 2077. They did say that that “maybe” there would be another surprise or two in the future. However, as the team puts the focus on the game’s sequel Project Orion, it could be assumed that time working on the first game is winding down. </p>



<p>Speaking of the game’s sequel, the game likely won’t arrive until after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-production-cd-projekt-red-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment of The Witcher</a>, currently known as Project Polaris.</p>



<p>What do you think of the features coming to Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Monument Valley 3, the third entry in the indie puzzle game series, is out today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monument-valley-3-announced-exclusively-for-netflix-games-at-gamescom-with-prequel-ports/1100-6525992/" data-ref-id="1100-6525992">exclusively on Netflix Games</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/making-a-monument-valley-for-the-netflix-generation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, developer Ustwo spoke about its history with mobile platforms and how introducing live-service elements to Monument Valley 3 was a natural transition. Usetwo is planning to release new content for Monument Valley 3 with every real-life season, along with new activities and puzzles on a regular basis. Previous games in the series had DLC.</p><p>"But for Monument Valley, [we've] always done downloadable content. It's just less rhythmic, less predictable, when they come out," explained director Jennifer Estaris. "And so for me, it was about. How do we make that a healthy habit for players, where they can know that something is coming and they get excited about it? But also tied to the themes of the game about caring for the world, not just being a one-and-done experience."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ew6PCGzOk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E9ew6PCGzOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ustwo's other games have been on Netflix and Apple Arcade before, including Assemble with Care and Desta: The Memories Between, so the developer is comfortable working on mobile platforms. Monument Valley, after all, is a series that started on mobile devices before coming to PC.</p><p>"Personally, I don't think Monument Valley 3 would be a Monument Valley game if it had to mould itself to the requirements of a free-to-play model in order to survive," said lead producer Jonathan Lau. "So it could only have survived on a subscription service, regardless of who that was with."</p><p>So far, Monument Valley 3 is sitting at around a 70 average on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monument-valley-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a> with three reviews in. Both Monument Valley and its sequel are available on Netflix as well. Given that they also received PC versions later on, it's possible Monument Valley 3 might too, but as of now, it's exclusive to Netflix.</p>

Epic Games will continue to support <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the game's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a>-style mode developed by Harmonix, for the forseeable future. 
</p>
<p>
The confirmation comes today, as Festival celebrates its first anniversary this weekend with access to play all of the mode's 285 tracks for a limited time. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, Epic Games expanded Fortnite beyond its shooter origins with the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, which has performed particularly well, plus Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing - the arcade racer mode made by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a> studio Psyonix. 
</p>
<p>
In October, Epic Games quietly announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">Rocket Racing would no longer receive regular themed content updates</a>, and the mode currently does not offer any further cosmetic rewards to unlock.
</p>
<p>
All of Fortnite's player experiences show public play counts, and from them it's easy to see the game's main modes - Battle Royale and Zero Build - with hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. Lego Fortnite typically ranges in the tens of thousands. Fortnite Festival usually sits around 15,000 players. Rocket Racing sits in the single digit thousands.
</p>
<p>
Festival also has a clear monetisation route, with a seasonal pass that features a particular music star, plus the option to purchase music tracks to keep and play whether a song is in the mode's current rotation or not. 
</p>
<p>
The mode kicked off by spotlighting The Weeknd, before subsequent seasons were headlined by genuine music giants like Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Metallica and Snoop Dogg. 
</p>
<p>
"While that's officially a wrap on the first year of Fortnite Festival, the Festival roadies and stage crew are already hard at work to make 2025 and beyond even bigger," Epic Games wrote today. "That said, 2024 isn’t over just yet, and we have some surprises to help see the year out in style!" 
</p>
<p>
The Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Colombian singer Karol G are getting reskinned "platinum" versions of their original skins, plus there are XP quests for playing their music in the coming days.
</p>
<p>It's a very busy time for Fortnite, which recently launched its permanent Fortnite OG offering. This week sees the arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">social sim Lego mode Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a> plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-goes-first-person-for-new-5v5-mode-ballistic">the Valorant-inspired Fortnite Ballistic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/project-breach-update-for-the-outlast-trials-now-live-introducing-amelia-collier/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, The Outlast Trials received a brand new major update named <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-barrels-announces-the-outlast-trials-project-breach-at-pc-gaming-show/">Project Breach</a>, which introduces the story of asylum escapee Amelia Collier, a character who is fueled by grief and anger and purposefully infiltrates the Murkoff Corporation to try and take them down to stop their grotesque experiments. Amelia is voiced by Caroline Dhavernas,&nbsp; best known for her role in Hannibal, as well as being the narrator in the game Child of light. This update has added a ton of content for those who want a brand-new challenge, as well as those who like to get more of the story. If you want to see what you're in for, make sure to check out the Project Breach trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials - Project Breach | New Update Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWjTZldpEjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This large update for The Outlast Trials includes a brand new trial for players to explore, called "Pleasure the Prosecutor." There is also a new environment that takes you Downtown, where you get to see Franco "Il Bambino" Barbi in action as the murderous man-child he is with his teeth-filled shotgun. There are also new challenges to participate in for those who like to be kept on their toes during intense scenes of survival. This includes reuniting the orphan with their mother and father in Reunite the Family, and de-cluttering your mind in Deface the Futtermans.</p>
<p>This update also adds a new player ability, which will be highly beneficial for those trying to survive in the Trials provided by Murkoff. This ability is called the Jammer Rig and allows you to disable electronic devices. This is good for players who know how to stay calm under pressure and will enable you to make strategic plays in the Trial.</p>
<p>Project Breach sees a new enemy added to The Outlast Trials, with the enemy being called The Molotov. This enemy has the ability to use a powerful ranged weapon that hurls Molotov Cocktails at the players, which explode on impact, creating large areas of fire that are a danger to those involved in the Trial.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy cosmetics, there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Unholy Night DLC pack</a>, which includes a set of eight Legendary Outfits, items, and art that you can use to decorate your cell, as well as some player icons to utilize in The Outlast Trials. If this is something that interests you, it can now be purchased for $19.99.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are also limited-time Trial variations thanks to the Winter Kills event that is currently taking place in the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-update-adds-boss-rush-mode-and-more.1056951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GameScience has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>update, and it's introducing a boss rush mode into the game, as well as a new Journeyer's Chart feature and more.</p>

<p>Two different challenge modes have been introduced in this update: Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. The former allows you to take on previously-fought bosses in single combat and features "three levels of difficulty", but if you haven't fought that boss in the main game, you won't be able to take it on here.</p>

<p>Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, is a boss rush mode in which you can fight "multiple opponents in succession" with different modifiers to make things more interesting. Some bosses will also sport new moves, so you'll need to be on your guard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-fight.jpg?itok=v3SrQtTV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-fight.jpg?itok=s07HZ7V2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s new challenge modes will let you take on previously-fought bosses.</figcaption></figure><p>Completing these gauntlets will net you special rewards, including new medicines, new drinks and soaks, and new curios, as well as new weapons and equipment for the Destined One to use.</p>

<p>As well as these new combat challenges, the latest&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>update is also adding a Journeyer's Chart feature to the game, which allows you to chart areas "for guidance and marking". You'll need to reach the Black Wind Mountain area and meet the Keeper to unlock this feature.</p>

<p>To celebrate the Chinese New Year (early, of course), GameScience has also gifted all&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>players with a special set of armor, which you can redeem through the Trailblazer's Gift feature at Keeper's Shrines.</p>

<p>You can read the full list of changes in this update <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's been released on the Epic Games Store first, and other platforms will follow "gradually".</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience. It follows the Destined One, a simian warrior who seeks to follow in the footsteps of the great fallen trickster king Sun Wukong.</p>

<p>The game was hugely popular upon its release back in August, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">topping the Steam charts</a> within a handful of hours and reaching 18 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">within two weeks</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

Lewis books about kids, witches, and talking lions. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>We already knew that Greta Gerwig—the director behind last year’s mega hit <em>Barbie</em>—was working on Narnia adaptations for Netflix, but thanks to an interview with the project’s producer, Amy Pascal, we now have a bit more color on what exactly those will consist of. The first of the movies will begin filming in 2025 and is “a very new take on Narnia,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/video/amy-pascal-interview-challengers-venom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/video/amy-pascal-interview-challengers-venom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Deadline</em></a></span> this week<em>.</em> “It’s all about rock and roll.”</p><p>Come again?</p><p>For anyone unacquainted with the seven-book series, Lewis’ Narnia is a fantastical world children can occasionally access where time moves differently and the mundanities and horrors of normal life are replaced by magic, monsters, and a lion as Jesus allegory called Aslan. There is no rock and roll in Narnia, at least as we currently know it, or even much music. </p><p>So does this mean Gerwig’s take on the famous series will be a musical? Or will it be more subtle than that, like Sofia Coppola’s pop music-laced <em>Marie Antoinette</em> from 2006. We did get more than that in last year’s <em>Barbie</em>, which despite some full-blown numbers like “I’m Just Ken” sung by Ryan Gosling, stopped short of being a traditional musical. </p><p> “I don’t know,” Gerwig <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/greta-gerwig-interview-narnia-movies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/greta-gerwig-interview-narnia-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Gamesradar</em> last year</a></span> on the subject of the upcoming Narnia movies. “I haven’t even really started wrapping my arms around it. But I’m properly scared of it, which feels like a good place to start. I think when I’m scared, it’s always a good sign. Maybe when I stop being scared, it’ll be like, ‘Okay. Maybe I shouldn’t do that one.’ No, I’m terrified of it. It’s extraordinary. And so we’ll see, I don’t know.” </p><p>If 2024's <em>Wicked</em> is any indication, a rock and roll musical adaptation of one of the Narnia books is probably just what the century-old books need to get people reading them again. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following its week post-launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> has its first patch of fixes, which will help with many of the environmental and audio issues currently in the game. The free-to-play online shooter pits some of Marvel's biggest guns--pun intended--against each other to take down Dr. Doom and Doom 2099. Patch 1 handles a lot of on-the-surface issues, but affects a few heroes including Dr. Strange. You can check out the full list below.</p><p>The big issue that was addressed involved players getting stuck on certain maps after being hit close to the edge. However, as the bug happens across multiple maps and areas, it might still be an issue elsewhere now.</p><p>"However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue," the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent blog post</a> read. "So we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on a way to prevent this from happening again."</p><p>The general minor bugs NetEase managed to resolve completely were issues like removing a lag when dealing with playing back highlights and recordings. There were also some textual errors, with more fixes on the way in a future update. Some common crash issues were also fixed, especially when dealing with saving Highlights. After the game crashes, the game had a chance to freeze for a long time before closing, but now the game will close after crashing.</p><p>Other small fixes include properly showing heroes' equipped costumes after joining a Quick Match as a replacement, and displaying mission progress correctly on the Season Event screen.</p><p>There were also minor console and PC issues that were resolved. On PC, when using FSR 3 frame-generation technology to modify the resolution, it could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. For PlayStation, when players have the Scarlet Spider costume equipped, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. Both issues have been resolved.</p><h3>Maps and Game Modes:</h3><ul><li>On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player's character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. That particular issue was mostly fixed, but as it happens in multiple stages, it could still happen somewhere else now.</li><li>In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, Birnin T'Challa: The fog would disappear from Hela and Storm's perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Frozen Airfield, during Competitive play, if a player was KO’d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lighting to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn't walk through). This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Eldritch Monument, when the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela's team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle's effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy.</li></ul><h3>Heroes</h3><ul><li>When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability's line would play. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>After Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow's settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In certain situations, Black Widow's Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>In certain extreme situations, Captain America's Ultimate wouldn't end as intended. This issue has been resolved.</li><li>When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution.</li></ul>

<p>The bundle also includes an 85 percent discount for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mythforces-wonderful-cartoon-co-op-nostalgia-is-held-back-by-skeletal-action">Mythforce</a>, Beamdog's roguelike adventure inspired by Saturday morning cartoons.</p>

<p>The Girls Make Games Scholarship Fund "provides need-based financial scholarships as well as mentorship to girls and young women interested in pursuing video game development summer camps, workshops and undergraduate degree programmes".</p>
<p>"Rogue Trader nails the 40k setting and provides an appropriately massive narrative filled with meaty tactical combat, though some bugs and poor performance hold it back," reads our Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warahmmer-50k-rogue-trader-review">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader review</a> from earlier this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, developer and publisher Owlcat Games has officially announced that Patch 1.3 is available for Warhammer 40,000:<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-traders-first-expansion-void-shadows-moved-to-september-24/"> Rogue Trader</a>. The game has officially turned a year old and is celebrating its first anniversary, and what better way to do so than with a massive update that benefits PC and console players? If you prefer to find out about the new update for Rogue Trader in a video, then make sure to check out the Rogue Trader Anniversary trailer below. Throughout the year, the team has made sure to take on feedback from the dedicated community and make their voices heard by making necessary changes and adding new content to keep the game fresh for new and returning players. Today, the new patch brings in a ton of new changes and quality-of-life improvements. Most importantly, the co-op mode in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is now available for up to 6 people on console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Birthday report from Abelard | Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9Qm6RBj6G0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patch 1.3 is the biggest update in the game thus far and has added over 1000+ visible and internal changes, which include adding lots of new cutscenes to the game for players to enjoy, as well as significant improvements to the pre-existing cutscenes in the game. There are also new items for players to experiment with, providing those who are playing Rogue Trader with a further diversified experience that isn't reliant on just a couple of items.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new voiceover has been added, which will be experienced predominantly in dialogue with Kibellah as well as companion banter with Kibellah. Alongside this, the character models for both Heinrix and Abelard have been updated.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg of content that has been added to the game, with a lot of it being focused on improving pre-existing content in the games, such as the Conviction point rebalance, as well as improvement of loot tables in Act I and II, so that players get to have better item progression, as well as a diversified experience, which is also helped by the large quantity of items added to the game.</p>
<p>If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of every change that has been made to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you can read all about it on the <a href="https://roguetrader.owlcat.games/news/en/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Rogue Trader page</a>, which goes into detail about every change that has been made in this patch. Of course, the trimmed-down version on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> covers the most significant changes, if you prefer to read it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Space Engineers 2 Announced, Release Date Coming Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-engineers-2-announced-release-date-coming-next-week.1056909/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>developer Keen Games) has revealed&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, a sequel to the popular space sandbox building sim&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>.</p>

<p>The game was revealed in a rather nondescript-sounding video simply titled "Concordia Research Facility for Modular Engineering", which, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers&nbsp;</em>fan, is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect a sequel announcement to appear in.</p>

<p>Said teaser shows off a number of features you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, the ability to partially copy certain elements of a construction, and "instant undoing of mistakes", as well as the ability to redo anything you've accidentally undone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-announcement-window.jpg?itok=dm1w2ngN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-announcement-window.jpg?itok=4x7qCSE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>promises all-new tools to play with.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the complexity of these new tools, the voiceover in the new trailer reassures players that said tools have been made "intuitive enough for anyone to grasp", even though they're "sophisticated enough to build wonders".</p>

<p>The trailer concludes by bidding players to "prepare for an experience unlike anything before", so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers&nbsp;</em>fan, it sounds like this is exactly the kind of sequel you'd want for the first game.</p>

<p>A livestream will be held on December 19th at 6pm UTC (that's around 1pm Eastern) with more&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>info, including an extended gameplay showcase and a reveal for the game's Early Access release date as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>, its developers describe it as a "sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration, and survival in space and on planets".</p>

<p>Released in February 2019 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-release-date-set-for-february-with-major-overhaul-to-survival" rel="nofollow">after five years of Early Access development</a>, the game allows you to build ships, space stations, outposts, and various other structures, using what you've built to carve out a life for yourself in the harsh wilderness of space.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll learn when you'll get to play it on December 19th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4.1056903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The PlayStation 5 has long since replaced the PlayStation 4 as the de facto Sony gaming console. However, if Marvel Rivals is on PS4, it would incorporate a ton of extra players who are yet to upgrade to the latest generation of hardware.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a technical…marvel. It looks stunning and its cel-shaded graphics pop on modern-day consoles and the latest PC rigs. Not only this, but a 6v6 match featuring a constant stream of projectiles, moving parts, and superhero taunts requires a lot of manpower. If you want to play Marvel Rivals on the PS4 though, it opens up a new line of questioning.</p>



<p>NetEase surely wants as many people playing the hero shooter as possible, but technical limitations are a constant barrier for many AAA games nowadays. Let’s see what the developer decided for Marvel Rivals and its PS4 fate—we already know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> compatibility.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-on-ps4">Is Marvel Rivals on PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re Doomed, all Doomed. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is not available to play on PS4. Developer NetEase has restricted the free-to-play shooter’s platform releases to the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a sad, harrowing reality of gaming in 2024. The PlayStation 4 (and its Pro upgrade) were once considered the pinnacle of console gaming. Now, they are becoming relics companies hardly take time to consider. Marvel Rivals isn’t alone in this neglect—so think twice before harboring a grudge!</p>



<p>I’m no expert, but I think it has a lot to do with developers unwilling to devolve their vision for a title. For example, a PS5 has a lot more power than the PS4, and therefore the main development is done with the PS5 in mind. A PS4 is very limited compared to its younger brother, and sacrifices need to be made.</p>



<p>As we’ve seen with Switch ports trying to imitate titles released on superior hardware, a dumbed-down version of a game isn’t necessarily worthwhile—or reflective of its quality. Therefore, many new releases are kept for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It doesn’t necessarily a PS4 port is dead as stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20241205/40185_1198415.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals release FAQ</a> mentions “Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Epic Store, and our official website (Loading Bay)” as the available platforms—not specifying which versions of those platforms. So if you’re a PS4 user desperate to yeet Captain America’s shield like a boomerang, all isn’t completely lost. We’ll update this guide in case anything changes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-update-adds-new-boss-rush-mode-journeyers-chart-and-plenty-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has issued a new update for the record-breaking action game, adding a number of new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.0.12.16581 adds a new boss rush mode called Challenge, which can be found at any Keeper’s Shrine after beating the game at least once. Two types of challenge are available: Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return of Rivals lets players challenge a defeated boss to a duel, choosing from three levels of difficulty. Gauntlet of Legends lets players fight against multiple opponents in succession, using customized curses to tailor the difficulty. As with Return of Rivals, if any opponents remain undefeated in the main game, the related gauntlet will be unavailable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This mode can be difficult, as some old opponents may surprise with new moves,” Game Science warned in a <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “Proceed with caution!” There are unique rewards tied to Challenge, detailed below in the patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the patch adds the new Journeyer's Chart, which is unlocked when the player first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper. Afterwards, for each new territory reached, a Journeyer's Chart can be bought at the Keeper's Shrine. There’s new equipment, too, to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year, and new music library functions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-dev-game-science-teases-surprises-for-later-this-year">Game Science teased “some surprises” for Black Myth: Wukong</a>. Accepting the Game of the Year award via video message at the Golden Joysticks, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji encouraged people who have yet to buy the smash hit action game to now do so. He then added the tease: “Of course, you might have already completed our game. That’s perfectly fine too. Keep following us, and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year.” It seems these new additions, designed for players who have beat Black Myth: Wukong already, are the surprises in question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong launched on August 19 and sold an eye-watering 18 million copies in just two weeks across PC and PS5, reportedly making over $700 million in revenue in the process. That was enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development. It did so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-points-to-black-myth-wukong-success-in-big-playstation-quarter-after-concord-disaster"><u>Sony pointed to Black Myth: Wukong as making a significant contribution to revenue</u></a> during its last financial quarter., making up for the Concord disaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DLC is set to follow. In September, Game Science investor Hero Games confirmed plans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-following-elden-rings-lead-with-dlc-expansion-before-any-sequel"><u>to release an Elden Ring-style expansion for Black Myth: Wukong ahead of any sequel</u></a>. Perhaps we'll get a first look at The Game Awards 2024 later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>Black Myth: Wukong review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Despite some frustrating technical issues, Black Myth: Wukong is a great action game with fantastic combat, exciting bosses, tantalizing secrets, and a beautiful world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re here, IGN has plenty more Black Myth: Wukong guides to help you out, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Essential Tips and Tricks</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Things_Black_Myth_Wukong_Doesn%27t_Tell_You"><u>Things Black Myth: Wukong Doesn't Tell You</u></a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Boss_List_and_Guides"><u>Boss List and Guides</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Myth: Wukong update 1.0.12.16581 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What to Know Before Patch Installation</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Due to the platform's update mechanism, your computer will need to reserve a larger amount of free disk space for temporary storage of the update files.</li><li>If you have installed any mods in the game, installing the patch may cause compatibility issues.

As NetEase noted, while these issues are largely resolved with today’s patch, the bug may be present elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've had a look at the entire map and have done our best to fix this bug,” <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase said in a blog post</a>. “However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue, so we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on a way to prevent this from happening again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase added that it’s keeping an eye on the frequency of different bugs and fixing them “as fast as we can.” Another patch is in the works, this time with new content, the developer promised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> is a smash hit for NetEase, securing 10 million players in just three days. The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. While Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation or Xbox player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available, and it’s there that Marvel Rivals is enjoying a particularly massive release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in Steam’s top five most-played games. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals has a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating, with 76% of the 35,000 reviews tagged as positive. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</u></a> to find out what we think. And keep an eye on the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-codes">Marvel Rivals codes</a> for free skins, and vote on the strongest Marvel Rivals characters in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Marvel_Rivals_Characters">community tier list</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Rivals update 20241210 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>All Platforms</strong><br>
<strong>General</strong></p><p>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Players joining a Quick Match as a replacement may not be able to see heroes' equipped costumes. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Mission progress on the Season Event screen would not display correctly. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Fixed some textual errors. More fixes will be coming in a future update.<br>· After a crash, the game had a chance to freeze for a long period of time before closing. This issue has been resolved, and now the game will close after crashing.<br>· Fixed some relatively common crash issues.<br>
<strong>Maps &amp; Game Modes
</strong><br>· On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player's character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. These issues have been largely resolved, but as this affects multiple maps and areas, this bug may be present elsewhere. We will work to continue fixing such issues and develop a solution to thoroughly prevent them.</p><p>· In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T'Challa:<br>    - Fog would disappear from Hela and Storm's perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</p><p>· In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Frozen Airfield:<br>    - In Competitive, if a player was KO’d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lightings to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn't walk through). This issue has been resolved.</p><p>· Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Eldritch Monument:<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela's team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</p><p>· When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle's effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy.<br>
<strong>Heroes</strong></p><p>· When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability's line would play. This issue has been resolved.<br>· After Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.<br>· When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.<br>· The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow's settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.<br>· In certain situations, Black Widow's Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.<br>· In certain extreme situations, Captain America's Ultimate wouldn't end as intended. This issue has been resolved.<br>· When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution.<br>
<strong>PC</strong></p><p>· Using FSR 3 frame generation technology to modify the resolution could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. This issue has been resolved.</p><p>———————————————————————————————————————<br>
<strong>Console</strong></p><p>· After equipping the PlayStation bundle's Scarlet Spider costume, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. This issue has been resolved.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p dir="ltr">No longer are YouTube Playables titles relegated to solo experiences. Google has revealed that it's testing out multiplayer functionality for the free games library, which is found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playables" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the YouTube website</a> or in the app.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&amp;msgid=312398093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> is seeing how real-time multiplayer works with two Playables titles: Ludo Club and Magic Tile 3. The former is similar to the Sorry board game and can be played with three other people from around the world. There is even simple chat functionality, such as selecting an angry emoji or saying, "Hello." This new feature works in browsers and on mobile devices, and Google teases there is more stuff on the way for Playables, too.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been over a year since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-is-testing-out-playable-games/1100-6517522/" data-ref-id="1100-6517522">YouTube first rolled out Playables to select users</a> in September 2023. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youtube-introduces-new-playables-game-library/1100-6523785/" data-ref-id="1100-6523785">YouTube formally introduced the Playables games library</a> with over 75 titles for people to play. No downloading is required to check out games like Angry Birds Showdown, Cut the Rope, and Gin Rummy. YouTube will automatically save your progress, meaning you can return to a title wherever you left off.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, this isn't Google's first foray into gaming.

Xbox studios boss Matt Booty has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">the wait for PlayStation 5 owners to play Bethesda's hit new Indiana Jones game</a> is "as much a production decision as it is anything else".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tech-review">which by all accounts is excellent</a> - is out now on PC and Xbox, including via Game Pass.  A Playstation 5 launch was publicly confirmed back in August, though won't actually arrive until the spring of 2025.
</p>
<p>
So, why the wait? Was six months not enough time to get a PS5 version running well enough? Or was the decision purely business related - that, this side of Christmas, it was an advantage to still keep Indy off Xbox's main console competition?

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-video-game-plot-details-1236233902/">Variety</a>, Booty began by reiterating a line we've heard from Xbox chief <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> previous - that every game's launch on PlayStation or Nintendo consoles is an individual decision.
</p>
<p>
"We are very much making the [exclusivity and windowing] decisions on a game by game basis," Booty said. "And each of our studios is in a little bit of a different position."
</p>
<p>
For Indiana Jones, Booty suggested the extra time taken to launch the PS5 version was designed to ensure its original release for Xbox arrived as a "great experience".
</p>
<p>
"There's also the production timeline on a game, so the decision on spacing comes there first," Booty continued. "We want to make sure there's a great experience for our Xbox players, and then the gap between [when it becomes available on PlayStation] is as much a production decision as it is anything else."
</p>
<p>
That said, Booty did finish by noting Indiana Jones was "a game that was in production before we acquired Bethesda, even", which is an interesting point to raise. Was it not in development for PS5 back then?
</p>
<p>
Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-hasnt-pulled-any-games-from-playstation-following-redfall-ps5-reports">Microsoft said it hadn't "pulled any games from PlayStation"</a> after a kerfuffle over comments from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/redfall">Redfall</a> game designer Harvey Smith, who said Microsoft's stance on Redfall's development was "no PlayStation 5" after its takeover.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this was in the era before Xbox multi-platform publishing was as much of a thing - a stance that only shifted earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment</a> arrived on Nintendo and Sony platforms.
</p>
<p>
So, which Xbox franchise joins PlayStation next?
</p>
<p>
"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> Obelisk update is here, and it’s the biggest update for the game to date, bringing a new map for the Operations PvE mode, a new Chaos enemy, and a Dark Angels cosmetics pack for those with the Season Pass. The update is out now across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> (with new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support), <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Obelisk Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNMrZ7_l9NM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Return to the burial world of Demerium in the new Operation, Obelisk. Here you’ll battle against the new Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, who have fast paced attacks and zip around the world on a flying Disc of Tzeentch. However, they won’t be limited to just this map. As a new Majoris enemy, they can be found in every Operation that features the Thousand Sons from now on.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Season Pass has some new goodies with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, which includes a new Champion skin for the Bulwak class, and new skins for the Plasma Pistol, Auto Bolt Rifle and Power Sword. You’ve also got a new Storm Shield skin and over 40 unique cosmetics celebrating eight of the Dark Angels Successor Chapters.</p>
<p>The Obelisk update brings some enhancement for PS5 Pro and PC gamers, with the patch adding new maximum resolutions for both the 60FPS Performance Mode and 30FPS Quality mode, using PS5 Pro’s PSSR upscaling technique to hit 4K in both situations. PC players will now also have FSR 3 upscaling support, and DLSS 3 with frame generation support.</p>

<p>Saber is committed to bringing more content to the game through 2025. This will include both free updates that add the Neo-Volkite pistol, more new PvE opeartions, PvP maps and modes, and a new Horde Mode in a later update. The Season Passes will then have more premium cosmetics to unlock for your Space Marines, so you can represent your favourite chapters.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">our Space Marine 2 review</a>, Dom said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

It turned out that the 2022 agreement wasn’t binding, but the 2023 one was, and yet we’ve nearly run out of 2024 and still nothing’s started! We’ve now learned that the intervening time was spent agreeing to “creative guidelines,” which is actually more fun than it sounds—see below. I hope it was done over a game, GW playing Space Marines, Amazon playing Cultists, and Henry Cavill running around the room going “Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”</p><p>Back in 2022, poor, lovely Henry Cavill announced he was leaving Netflix’s adaptation of <em>The Witcher</em> to reprise his role as  Superman, moments before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568"><em>Black Adam</em> bombed so hard</a></span> that it destroyed the entire DC cinematic universe. James Gunn took over the franchise and made clear Cavill wasn’t part of his vision, and the actor was left standing at the altar, droopy flowers in his hands, his former fiancée now hooked up with Liam Hemsworth.</p><p>But then in swooped <em>Warhammer 40K</em> to sweep him off his feet, although it’s been a very drawn-out engagement. While today’s announcement at least confirms that projects can finally go ahead, the GW statement concludes, “Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.”</p><p>Meanwhile, over on the less corporate face of the company, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer Community</em></a></span>, there’s a story that better details what’s happening right now, and what the last year entailed. They explain,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell... yep, we said <em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun - sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p></blockquote><p>“Enormity” is probably not the right word, unless they <em>really</em> hate it, but what splendid news! It wasn’t all lawyers and eyebrows, but proper planning to get a whole bunch of different shows (and maybe movies?) out of the license. </p><p>Next up, the site says, is scripts. The average time spent in a writers’ room for a prestige streaming show at the moment is around eight months, before anyone touches a camera or a paintbrush, so it doesn’t seem likely that filming would begin before 2026.

Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though—more to come in time!”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Out June 20, 2025, the movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and a ripped Ralph Fiennes, among others.</p><p>The most effective part of the trailer is a recitation of Rudyard Kipling’s  poem “Boots,” about marching during the Second Boer War in South Africa. “Try—try—try—try—to think o’ something different—Oh—my—God—keep—me from goin’ lunatic!” the voice over goes. “(Boots—boots—boots—boots—movin’ up an’ down again!) There’s no discharge in the war!”</p><p>The biggest mystery about the movie might not be why the rage virus is back, but what Murphy’s role will be. The central protagonist of the first movie, he’s set to appear in the third film but it’s not exactly clear how. In a split-second near 1:47 in the trailer there’s an emaciated zombie body that looks like Murphy, rising out of a field of wild flowers. Maybe he’s infected. Maybe he’s found a way to overcome the virus.

He later appeared as Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies and the hit series <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. Murphy returns to the zombie franchise after winning an Oscar for his performance last year in <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s 5.0 update introduces an Obelisk Operation, a new enemy and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-details">Space Marine 2 Obelisk Update Details&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Operation takes players to Demerium. Here, their goal is to disrupt the flow of energy protecting an Aurora device. To do that, you must rotate a replica of the obelisk. However, the console control of the device is placed deep into the heart of a “tomb plunged into darkness”. The operation is set to occur “parallel to the final events of the campaign.”</p>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Update also introduces a new Majoris enemy called Tzaangor Enlightened. This disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid enemy will be found in all Operations featuring the Thousand Suns and should be considered a formidable opponent when in great numbers. The way to bring them down is to catch them after a parry or during a long animation; the developers have advised using a Target Lock when facing this enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the update also brings new Season Pass content with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack. Season Pass owners can grab Dark Angels Successor Chapters cosmetics, including Dark Angels Champion skin (Bulwark) and weapon skins for Auto Bolt Rifle, Plasma Pistol, Power Sword and Bulwark’s Storm Shield.&nbsp;</p>
