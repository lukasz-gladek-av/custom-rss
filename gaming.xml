He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, accessory maker Genki showed off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed mockup</a> it said was based on the Nintendo Switch 2’s official dimensions just days before the console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">first official reveal</a>. The company has since started offering Switch 2 accessories that it says will be compatible with the system at launch. Now, Nintendo is suing the company, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/">reports <em>The Game Post</em></a>.</p><p>Filed May 2nd, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">Nintendo’s complaint</a> alleges that Genki is guilty of five counts of “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising,” and that its actions violated multiple laws, including the Trademark Act of 1946. It claims that Genki’s use of Nintendo’s trademarks is confusing to buyers, who are “likely to impute any shortcomings, defects, or lack of quality in Genki’s products to Nintendo” itself.</p><p>Nintendo’s lawyers write that although Genki has promoted its products as compatible with the Switch 2 at launch, it has been inconsistent about whether their designs are truly based on unofficial access to the console itself. Nevertheless, they claim customers will probably think the products are Nintendo-authorized, and that Genki is “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Nintendo asks that the court require Genki to stop selling products marketed with Nintendo’s trademarks, and for compensation for any damages Nintendo sustained from the the alleged offenses, and more.</p><div><p>Genki addresses the lawsuit in a statement <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231">posted to X</a>, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-began-working-on-switch-2-shortly-after-the-release-of-switch-1-new-genki-lawsuit-papers-reveal"><em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.</p><p>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.</p><p>While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week.</p><p>We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers. —Team Genki</p></blockquote></div><p>Genki isn’t the only company that unveiled accessories for the Switch 2 before Nintendo officially revealed it. Dbrand announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">Switch 2 case</a> in December, and before that, smaller accessory makers announced things like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">screen protectors</a>. These sorts of early accessory announcements aren’t unusual in the world of smartphones, where case makers turn to leaked specifications to make risky bets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23892671/iphone-15-pro-action-button-case-maker-problems">that don’t always pan out</a>. But for Nintendo, Genki at least seems to have crossed a line that it simply isn’t willing to tolerate.</p><p>Nintendo did not immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epic%E2%80%99s-tim-sweeney-%E2%80%93-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded.1180803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games president and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney discussed Unreal Engine 6 for the first time (alongside several other topics) in a massive interview featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Lex Friedman podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney said that the next big iteration of the Unreal Engine technology will unify the parallel development threads that Epic is currently working on. The goal is to get the first UE6 previews out to developers in two to three years.</p>
<p><em>We have these two different tendrils of progress. There's Unreal Engine 5 for game developers, and there's Unreal Engine 5 targeting the Fortnite community. And there's different bits of development that are only in one area that aren't applied to both. Not all the Unreal Engine 5 features are actually available in Fortnite, because some of them we haven't figured out or haven't gotten to the point where we can deploy them to all seven platforms in a platform-independent way. </em></p>
<p><em>The place where all of these different threads of development come together is Unreal Engine 6.&nbsp; </em><em>And it's a few years away. We don't have an exact timeframe, but we could be seeing preview versions of it perhaps two to three years from now. We're making continuous progress towards it.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Epic president admits that the technology is currently being hindered by the company's decision to stick with single-threaded simulations. That choice was made to simplify things not only for Epic itself but also for all game developers, but it is a limitation that Sweeney plans to overcome with Unreal Engine 6, which should finally fully embrace multithreading.</p>
<p><em>The biggest limitation that's built up over time is the single-threaded nature of game simulation on Unreal Engine. We run a single-threaded simulation. If you have a 16 core CPU, we're using one core for game simulation and running the rest of the complicated game logic because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude easier than multi-thread programming, and we didn't want to</em><br>
<em>burden either ourselves, our partners, or the community with the complications of multi-threading.</em></p>
<p><em>Over time, that becomes an increasing limitation, so we're really thinking about and working on the next generation of technology and that being Unreal Engine 6, that's the generation we're actually going to go and address a number of the core limitations that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine and get those on a better foundation that the modern world deserves, given everything that's been learned in the field of computing in that timeframe.</em></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the source of most, if not all, the CPU-related issues we've seen with Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games. It's great to hear Epic is finally going to address it, though it'll be a long while before we see Unreal Engine 6 in any game. As a reminder, the first UE5 preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-preview-updated-to-allow-for-even-bigger-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in early 2022</a>, while the first games that took advantage of the new technology didn't appear on the market until mid-to-late 2023: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layers of Fear remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a>, to name a few. As such, we might have to wait until late 2028/2029 to play the initial batch of Unreal Engine 6 games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/660272/shotgun-cop-man-review-pc-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shotgun Cop Man</em> is a strange platformer. You play as a square man with a round, bald head who’s chasing Satan to arrest him. At the beginning of each of the game’s nine worlds, Satan gives you the middle finger. And you don’t just use guns for fighting, but for traversal as well.</p><p>You start each world with two guns: a rapid-fire but weak pistol and a more powerful shotgun that only has three blasts. When you’re on the ground, your ammo constantly refills, meaning you essentially have infinite ammo. But when you’re in the air, if you run out of bullets, you won’t get a refill until you touch the ground.</p><p>This all matters because there’s no jump button. That means you get into the air by shooting your guns: the pistol lets you hover, while the shotgun can rocket you upward to reach high platforms. You can aim in any direction, so the shotgun can blast you backward and forward, too — it’s a speedy and fun way to get around. It’s all a little bit like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9538815/downwell-hp-lovecraft-game-iphone-steam">Downwell</a></em>, but sideways.</p><p>You’ll need to get around quickly to dodge Satan’s minions. Most often, you’ll take on little devils that spit bullets and are generally a nuisance. But there are a few more difficult enemies, such as flying sentient saws with one eye. There are bosses at the end of each world, too, like a flying skull with horns that can manifest a body to attack you with.</p><p>If you get hit by an enemy or stung by a spike, your heart will fly a short distance away from your body. If you get the heart back, you’ll survive another hit and the heart will float away again. It’s similar to a <em>Sonic</em> game, where you can take a hit so long as you have at least one ring. If you’re hit while your heart is out, you’ll die — though thanks to the game’s generous checkpoint system, you usually won’t start too far from where you were killed.</p><p>Each world has 17 short levels that are filled with typical platforming dangers including baddies, spikes, moving platforms, lasers, and block pushing puzzles. (Block shooting puzzles?) Individual levels generally take 30 seconds to a couple minutes to beat, so depending on how skillful you are with your guns, you can zip to the goal quickly and feel like a speedrunner.</p><p>You’ll frequently find new guns, too. I was a big fan of one that made bullets bounce off walls, which doubled as a useful puzzle-solving tool. The sniper rifle was a welcome upgrade because it could blast through multiple enemies at once.</p><p>Visually, the game looks like a platformer in dark mode: black is the primary color, and enemies are generally a shade of red. Throughout the game, you’ll hear a persistent, thumping, and unnerving soundtrack that sounds like what you’d hear at some kind of Satan-worshipping club. The whole vibe makes you feel as if you’re actually descending into the pits of some dark hell.</p><p>My favorite part of the game was that you could accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. My full playthrough was about three and a half hours, and I could get through most of the nine worlds in about 20 or 30 minutes. I appreciated the brevity, because even though I very much enjoyed the game, the intentionally uncomfortable atmosphere got under my skin, and I could only play it in short bursts.</p><p>Once you understand how to navigate just with <em>Shotgun Cop Man’s</em> guns, you can really fly around the levels like some kind of cartoony action hero. By the end, you’ll use those guns to give the finger right back to Satan.</p><p><em><sub>Shotgun Cop Man is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Consider the PlayStation 2. Not all of the PS2 Slim's streamlining came from chip improvements—it also shed a full-sized 3.5-inch hard drive bay and a little-used IEEE 1394 port, and initially required an external power brick. But shrinking and consolidating the console's CPU, GPU, memory, and other components took the console from its original design in 2000, to the Slim in 2004, to an even lighter and lower-power version of the Slim that returned to using an internal power supply without increasing the size of the console at all.</p>
<p>Over that same span, the console's price dropped frequently and significantly, from $299 at launch to just $129 by 2006 (the price was lowered again to $99 in 2009, deep into the PS3 era).</p>
<p>Or look at Microsoft's Xbox 360. Its external design didn't change as much over the years—the mid-generation "slim" refresh was actually only a little smaller than the original. But between late 2005 and early 2010, the CPU, GPU, and the GPU's high-speed eDRAM memory chip went from being built on a 90 nm process, to 80 nm, to 65 nm, and finally to a single 45 nm chip that combined the CPU and GPU into one.</p>
<p>Over that time, the system's power supply fell from 203 W to 133 W, and the base price fell from $300 to $200. The mid-generation 65nm refresh also substantially fixed the early consoles' endemic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems#General_Hardware_Failure_errors">red ring of death</a>" issue, which was caused in part by the heat that the older, larger chips generated.</p>
<p>As you can see when comparing these various consoles' external and internal design revisions, shrinking the chips had a cascade of other beneficial and cost-lowering effects: smaller power supplies, smaller enclosures that use less metal and plastic, smaller heatsinks and cooling assemblies, and smaller and less complicated motherboard designs.</p>

<p>A slowdown of that progression was already evident when we hit the PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch generation, but technological improvements and pricing reductions still followed familiar patterns. Both the mid-generation PS4 Slim and Xbox One S used a 16 nm processor instead of the original consoles' 28 nm version, and each also had its price cut by $100 over its lifetime (comparing the Kinect-less Xbox One variant, and excluding the digital-only $249 Xbox One). The Switch's single die shrink, from 20nm to 16nm, didn't come with a price cut, but it did improve battery life and help to enable the cheaper Switch Lite variant.</p>

<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Court papers filed in California, USA, show Nintendo is formally suing accessories manufacturer Genki for infringing its trademark, as well as alleging unfair competition and false advertising.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited Genki on the CES trade show floor in January</a> after videos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">its dummy Switch 2 console went viral</a> before the system was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">formally revealed by Nintendo on 2nd April</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo has filed its copyright claim against Genki, accusing the company of "capitalising" on demand for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> news and giving "contradictory and inconsistent" statements.</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uGRs-ispRU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Beginning at least as early as December 2024, [Genki] embarked upon a strategic campaign intended to capitalise on the public interest surrounding Nintendo's next-generation console," court papers <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">said</a>,</p>
<p>"In January 2025, [Genki] began advertising that it gained unauthorised access to Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console, which had not yet been released or even revealed publicly by Nintendo. Following its initial claims of access to a genuine Nintendo Switch 2 console, Defendant's statements were contradictory and inconsistent, with Defendant later stating that it was never in possession of a console. Nevertheless, Defendant has since maintained its representation to consumers that its accessories will be compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2 upon the console's release."</p>
<p>Nintendo said that "ensuring the compatibility of Defendant's accessories would not be possible unless and until Defendant has access to a Nintendo Switch 2 console" and insists it neither provided nor authorised a Switch 2 to the company. Therefore, Nintendo alleges Genki either misled consumers by pretending to have a "genuine console" when it didn't, or "unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2, or proprietary technical information about the Nintendo Switch 2, prior to the console's release to the public".</p>
<p>"Genki boasted its alleged early access to the unreleased console and allowed guests to hold and measure the mockups," Nintendo's lawyers said, adding the videos, renders, and images Genki displayed at its CES booth and on its website infringed Nintendo's copyright and "garnered significant attention from the media and public resulting in confusion among consumers as to the validity of Genki's statements and association with Nintendo".</p>
<p>"Public discourse and confusion over Genki's announcements were so significant that on January 10, 2025, Nintendo issued a statement to reporters about the incident, clarifying that 'the gaming hardware that Genki presented as Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by us'," Nintendo added.</p>
<p>Then, on 20th January, Genki posted a picture of its CEO, Edward Tsai, on its official Twitter account with the caption: "Genki ninjas infiltrate Nintendo Kyoto HQ", which Nintendo said was "an apparent attempt to further confuse the public as to whether Genki had access to a Nintendo Switch 2 and/or an affiliation with Nintendo". It then updated its website and advertisements "to boast about its early access to Nintendo Switch 2 information", saying: "Can you keep a secret? We can’t..."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On 1st April, 2025 - the day before Nintendo's Switch 2 Nintendo Direct - Genki allegedly "mass-emailed its marketing list and posted on social media an announcement of its own 'Direct' presentation to be held on the same day as Nintendo's highly anticipated presentation". Nintendo then took issue with the name of Genki's broadcast - Genki Direct - and its branding materials.</p>
<p>"Genki's claims of compatibility would be impossible to guarantee without unauthorised, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2. Thus, Genki has misled and is misleading the public as to its ability to guarantee the compatibility of its products with the Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
<p>Nintendo is asking for Genki to be stopped from using "Nintendo Switch" in its marketing, destroy any products or marketing that does use Nintendo's copyright, and "recover all damages it has sustained as a result of Defendant's infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, and that said damages be trebled".</p>
<p>Interestingly, the court papers also revealed that Nintendo wasted no time designing the Switch successor, saying: "Shortly after the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo began planning its successor console, with formal hardware development beginning around 2019."</p>
<p>The Switch 2 will release on 5th June and cost £396. Nintendo is gearing up for the launch of Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">by releasing a chunky update for the original Switch</a>. Update Version 20.0.0 adds a number of features to the console, including the new Virtual Game Card system, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">allows players to share their digital games with another console</a> or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Half-Life 3 is not just in development, but it's now "playable, end-to-end".</p>
<p>That's according to Valve insider Tyler McVicker, who posits the eagerly-anticipated sequel could be announced as early as this summer (Q3), with a possible release before the end of 2025, probably winter (Q4).</p>
<p>We already had strong evidence - if no specific confirmation - that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, codenamed HLX, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.</p>

<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-reportedly-playable-in-its-entirety-and-could-be-announced-this-year-183030499.html">Engadget</a>, McVicker gave a livestreamed Q&amp;A packed with explosive clues and hints about what's to come, and he has once again stressed: "The game is not VR. Half Life 3 is not a VR title."</p>
<p>"HLX is being playtested so religiously and so widely that there are individuals who will just talk," McVicker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=1300s">said</a>. "I personally have a policy of avoiding any story-related questions or information wherever possible, so I currently have avoided all of them. But I've been offered it by people whom are trustworthy and I know some of my contemporaries have been given it so there is information out there about the plot..."</p>
<p>That said, he did tease that he "actually do[es] think [Portal's] Chell may turn up in Half-Life 3", and stressed: "Erik Wolpaw wants to do Portal 3 so fuckin' bad". McVicker also opined it was possible Portal 3 could be the next single-player project developed at Valve, but that may depend upon who is "gonna retire" after Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>"This is the furthest (HLX) has ever been. Period," he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=8230s">added</a>. "The game is playable - end to end. Period. [Other HL3/Ep3 projects have] never been that far. And they're optimising, polishing, and they're probably content-locked and if they're not then they're mechanic locked."</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=2310s">addressed</a> the procedural generation system, saying it has been "misunderstood" by the general public.</p>
<p>"The way Valve is going about that is akin to taking the [AI] Director from Left4Dead 2 and making it significantly more powerful. It's not changing geometry. It's instead changing entity placement, right [... like] doors, physics props, enemies, items. NPCs of any kind." He also disputes claims the story will be procedurally generated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-cancelled-a-lot-of-games-over-the-last-10-years-including-half-life-3-and-left-4-dead-3">What we <em>do</em> know for sure is Half-Life 3 was in development 2013/2014</a>, and was set to be a procedurally-generated, replayable game that fused <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-inspired gameplay with scripted story moments. It was cancelled because it was built on the unfinished Source 2 engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It's no mystery that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been a great success, given that developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it's already a million seller (despite being available on Game Pass, too). How does it compare to other JRPGs, though?</p>
<p>According to our analyst friend Rhys Elliott, who was often <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously featured in exclusive interviews on Wccftech</a>, it's selling much faster, at least on Steam. Elliott, who recently left MIDiA Research to become Head of Market Analysis at Alinea Analytics, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-more-than-twice-as-fast-as-other-jrpgs-on-pc-analyst-says-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the game's surprising early sales compared to triple-A games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a certified hit, officially selling more than one million copies. The announcement didn't say players reached – it said copies sold. That was a choice, and I applaud the transparency. It's worth noting that two of these are ports, but the data still speaks volumes for how much gamers are drawn to Expedition 33. The low price point likely also factored in, as our Steam data shows that many players bite the bullet when an AAA game goes on sale and drops below $50.</em></p>

<p>The same doesn't quite apply to PlayStation sales, where Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold four times faster at launch. However, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is still ahead of the rest of the pack. Besides, losing to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PlayStation isn't surprising, given the enormous hype surrounding that game ahead of its launch last year.</p>

<p>In the interview mentioned above, Elliott also pointed to the fact that several JRPG fans were waiting for such a realistic JRPG, even with its turn-based combat, in contrast to Square Enix's public statements on the matter:</p>
<p><em>There was also an opening for a modern, realistic-looking JRPG. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has given RPG fans something they always wanted. If you asked Final Fantasy fans from the late '90s/early '00s what the ideal version of a JRPG should look like, it'd be something like this.</em></p>
<p>The reference is quite obvious. Back in June 2022, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it is getting harder to mix turn-based combat and realistic graphics because they create a feeling of idiosyncrasy among some players. Indeed, that game focused strictly on action-based combat, shunning the series' traditional turn-based system.</p>
<p>While I personally don't fully disagree with Yoshida's assessment, there is definitely still space for turn-based combat, especially if it is revamped with key innovations such as in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which features real-time dodges and parries.</p>
<p>Besides, this particular game is just too good at almost everything it does, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's 9.5/10 review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>

Do you ever think to yourself, "gee, I wish that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">LA Noire</a> actually looked like a noir film and also everyone is a furry"? Then boy howdy do I have the game for you: The Shadow Syndicate. It just got announced yesterday at the Gamescom Latam showcase, and I should say it's not exactly like LA Noire in that you don't have to try and read the faces of motion capture actors overperforming their hearts out. What it does have is some detective work, gunplay, and even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payneish</a> bullet-time. How can you not be into that mixture?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game is set in an early 1930s Brooklyn, and you play as private detective Sam Marlowe. According to a press release, Sam's mentor has gone missing, and alongside that there's a weird secret group getting up to no good.

I would like to point out there is also essentially zero mention of the fact that everyone is an anthropomorphic animal anywhere in said press release, the only mention it gets is "evocative character designs", which they certainly are. I'm into it though, this is a hard-boildish Noir we're talking about, everyone being a dog or a chicken is just the way of the world, don't think about it too hard.
</p>
<p>
There's two parts to the gameplay, one being the aforementioned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gunplay, which does seem to borrow from Max Payne's iconic mechanic. The other is talking to citizens to collect clues, as well as interacting with the city at large, all of which gets jotted down in Sam's journal to help open up new dialogue options and story paths.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, The Shadow Syndicate doesn't have an exact release date just yet. It's due out some time in 2026 at the very least, and in the meantime, you can always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

            <p>
I'm not sure how they have time for it, but as part of a livestream held earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> revealed yet another new game. This one isn't a completely new world, it's actually another Honkai game, though right now it doesn't have a name. A very short teaser was shared for it which literally just called it a "brand new Honkai game", but there were a couple of signs that it was one anyway. Namely, the presence of a couple of characters, Kiana and Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Kiana isn't from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Star Rail</a>, she's from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-impact">Impact 3rd</a>, one of the main characters in fact, and Blade is a playable character in Star Rail, so it seems like there's a bit of a crossover going on here. The teaser doesn't have a lick of gameplay, it's just a pre-rendered cutscene, but I think it's a safe bet on being some kind of Pokemon clone. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="547"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1kdsy74/new_honkai_game_announced/">New Honkai Game announced</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable-Feedback11/">u/Vegetable-Feedback11</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/">HonkaiStarRail</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
When Kiana rocks up she's accompanied by the most gelatinous looking dog creature you've ever seen in your life. Blade also has a dog thing with him, though his one's a bit cooler, and the two dogs are shown charging towards each other for a fight. You can see a couple of other characters that also have their own critters with them, so, this really does come across as HoYoVerse starting to stake their claim on Pokemon's cash cow.
</p>
<p>
There's as strong possibility of the game being named Honkai: Nexus Anima as the fan-run account <a href="https://x.com/StarRailVerse1/status/1915725508639179139">Star Rail Universe</a> found that a bunch of Twitter accounts have been registered with that name. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
</p>
<p>
Pokemon doesn't seem like the only game that HoYoVerse is going after, as there's been leaks and other social media accounts spotted to do with a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hoyoverse-stardew-valley-style-game-astaweave-haven-wechat-account-potential-announcement-soon">game that might be in the vein of Stardew Valley</a>. This is what I mean about them being so busy! Guess they really just want to have a game for every genre.

Well, this is all a bit awkward. Yesterday, you might have seen claims that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> writer Yuji Horii accidentally confirmed that a remake of the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> is in the works. It all read a bit suspicious right off the bat, because it initially just came from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?sort=new">Reddit post</a> from someone who attended a panel Horii was speaking at during Napoli Comicon without any video evidence. Then some other posts started cropping up, alongside commenters saying they were also there and that this was true. Except, it isn't true, because it was all a translation miscommunication.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Later on in the day, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2448211166?t=18941s">Twitch VOD</a> was shared of the event, where <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lo7v4b6jdc23">Gematsu</a> was able to confirm that Horii didn't actually mention anything about a remake of Chrono Trigger at all. It seems that somehow the interpreter interpreted something Horii said as confirmation of a remake. I can't tell you how that happened though, as I neither speak Japanese nor Italian. Go figure!
</p>
<p>
It's not exactly a surprise that such a story got people so excited so quickly. After all, on the game's 30th anniversary back in March, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> noted that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">plan to share word of various projects</a> that "go beyond the world of the game" later this year. I can't exactly blame someone for thinking that that's code for "a remake is coming", and for all I know one still is happening. It just hasn't been accidentally revealed by one of its lead writers, that's all.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don't even think it needs a remake. I'd imagine it would be an HD-2D one in the style of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> 3 and Live A Live, which while pretty, just feels pretty unnecessary. Of course, none of you can hold this against me if one does get announced and I think it looks cool, actually, ok? Cheers.

We're not too far off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> now, with the spinoff game due out right at the end of the month. Some of you might have even played some of it already, unlike James, who struggled to play any of it at all when the test was held <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ten-pc-games-i-could-have-played-in-full-during-the-time-i-spent-failing-to-connect-to-elden-ring-nightreign-on-ps5">back in February</a>. Considering how few of us have actually spent any time on it overall though, quite conveniently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> shared a little overview trailer yesterday that dove into what you'll be doing in the Fortniteish Souls game.
</p>
<p>
When you first drop into Limveld, you'll be doing so pretty weak as a level one character. From there, you can fight just regular old enemies, loot some treasure chests, the typical kind of thing you'd do in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. One thing that differs is that you can also sneak into different bases to try to get some info from some maps about the land. And, of course, there's also some big blighters that'll knock you down pretty easily if you're not careful you can try to take a whack at if you're feeling brave enough for some bigger rewards.

<p>
Another big difference is random events that can take place. As you might already know, from session to session the maps change shape, sometimes much more dramatically than others. Sometimes there'll be a volcanic area that erupts, or you'll have to trek through some woods full of rot. That guy that calls you a foul tarnished might rock up too! There honestly looks to be quite a lot of variation.
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite constantly dwindling circle storm aspect of the game isn't just a case of it slowly killing you while you're outside it. By the time nightfall comes, you'll be forced into a very tiny circle, having to fend off some much tougher enemies.
</p>
<p>
You'll also find that this game's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> looks a bit different. It's here where you'll equip relics that have different effects. Just your usual stat buffs and improved skills kind of things from the looks of it, but it wasn't a particularly comprehensive look. 
</p>
<p>
There's an in-game currency called murk that lets you buy different outfits for the preset characters, so there'll be some amount of customisation at the very least. And yes, there is a Solaire of Astora costume, amongst references to other characters too. My favourite's the hunter outfit from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, which won't be a surprise to anyone that knows me.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, despite not being able to make your own character, you can find something called fragments which unlock bits of the respective Nightfarers' backstory. And, of course, there's proper boss fights if you make it to the third day in a session. Wouldn't be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> without boss fights!
</p>
<p>
I'm still not entirely convinced by Nightreign as a concept, it's a smart way to reuse assets that's for sure. I just prefer my FromSoft games to be a little bit more handcrafted. Still, I'll keep my mouth shut until May 30th, when the game launches.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was a strong remaster, not just because it was a great Unreal Engine 5 upgrade for a decade-old game, but because it included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for fans to solve, with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-subway-escape-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858%3Fl%3Denglish&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=49867ab213c4ee089d653e284f7a2968&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">16 of those puzzles</a> being made by fans who collaborated with Croteam on the expansion. So it's no surprise that these are some of the most difficult puzzles to solve in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through how to solve the Castle puzzle in the expansion, one of the more complicated puzzles. If you don't want the whole solution, and just want a hint, then the best hint I can give is that you need to make lasers fly.</p>
<p>If you want the full solution, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Castle Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Gather all the pieces</h3>
<p>When you enter the Castle puzzle area, you'll notice that the tetromino is on an elevated platform that you can only reach by a fan directly underneath it, and that you'll need to get both a red and blue laser to the nodes on either side of this elevated platform to reach the tetromino.</p>
<p>To do that, you first need all the pieces you'll need. Basically, this puzzle is one part gather the pieces, the other part execution.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start by grabbing the fan off the vent below where you fly up to the tetromino, and place the fan on the pressure switch directly in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;With the fan on the pressure switch, you'll be able to reach the first connector (C1). Connect it to the red node and red laser generator that you can see through the window, and the red node on the wall behind you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan from the pressure switch, and use the fan that's activated to fly yourself (with the first fan in hand) over the gate and into the walled-off area with a deactivated fan vent and a second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan on the vent to activate it, grab the connector and use it to get back across to the other room, without having to pass through the purple forcefield between them.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring C2 into the main puzzle area, and grab the fan you used to fly yourself over the gate the first time, and place it on the first pressure switch you activated. Now you're free to grab C1 and carry it to the center puzzle area, so that you have two connectors and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator that's on the left side of the puzzle area, and place it down on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area. Connect it to the red node in the room on the right side of the puzzle area to clear the path to a box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the box and bring it to the center puzzle area.&nbsp;Place the box on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area (removing the fan first) and using C1, connect it to the blue laser generator on the right side of the puzzle area and the blue node on the left side of the puzzle area. Place C1 on top of the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, and the red node that's hidden behind the shield you're deactivating with the blue lasers to release the third connector (C3). Bring the third connector into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you nearly have all the components you need. All that's left is the box stuck behind a shield on the right side of the center puzzle area, with a red and blue node on either side to deactivate it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Take the box off the pressure switch, and replace it with C1. Connect C1 to the red laser generator.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the blue laser generator, and the blue node in the center puzzle area on the right side.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the other side of the shield. Place C3 on top of the box, making sure the box is somewhere that you can angle C3 to hit C1 and the red node.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>If you've done it correctly, your laser layout will look something like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the second box and bring it to the center puzzle area. You should now have two boxes, three connectors, and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Make the lasers fly</h3>
<p>Now you have all the components, you're ready to make the lasers fly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one box, head up the stairs on the right side of the center puzzle area and place it in front of the fan underneath the blue node. Do the same with the other box on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1, and connect it to the blue laser generator, the blue node above the box, and the blue node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on top of the box under the blue node when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the room. Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the blue laser generator. Make sure the angles are set, and when you place C3 down, you should see the box and C1 on top of it flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node above the box, and the red node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on the box when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick the fan back up, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area. Grab C3 and connect it to C2 and the red laser generator. Again, ensuring the angels are right, when you place C3 down, the box and C2 should be flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now you can pick up the fan, and place it down on the vent just below the elevated platform where the tetromino is.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fly up to where the tetromino is, and the shield will be deactivated, letting you grab the tetromino to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's how you solve the Castle puzzle in The Talos Principle: Reawakened's new In the Beginning expansion. A few of the steps can be done differently, but it all leads to the same final shape. At least, I think it does. Let me know if you figured out a different solution.</p>

            <p>As fans come to terms with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> delay - from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kd7oq8/i_built_a_gta_6_countdown_website_because_therapy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">creating countdowns "that are cheaper than therapy"</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kdp5pp/i_think_we_need_to_calm_ourselves_about_the_delay/">pleas to "calm ourselves"</a> - at least one person is delighted by the news: Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 actor, Luke Dale.</p>
<p>Dale, who portrayed Hans Capon in the game, took a glass-half view on the delay, writing on X/Twitter: "WE'RE IN WITH A SHOT! GOTY!", appending the hashtag #KCD2.</p>

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAljLcUMomM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>You see, while players have been salivating for the next instalment of the universally-acclaimed series - so much so that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property</a>" - developers and publishers of other games targeting a similar release window were understandably worried about accidentally butting up against GTA 6's launch. Even Gearbox's Randy Pitchford was forced to strenuously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">deny that bringing Borderlands 4's release date forward</a> had anything to do with GTA 6 (which turned out to be true).</p>
<p>And of course, Luke Dale is <em>not</em> the only person in the games industry to have puffed out a sigh of relief yesterday - he just chose to do so publicly. The silver lining now is that games that have already released in 2025 - and those that had been holding back on solidifying release dates until  GTA 6'a launch was confirmed - can feel more confident about securing an accolade or two in award ceremonies or best games of 2025 lists (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/with-gta-6-delayed-to-2026-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-celebrates-were-in-with-a-shot-to-win-game-of-the-year-2025/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p> <div>

<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 three out of five stars</a>, writing: "This gorgeous medieval RPG continues to be just as divisive, prickly and abrasive as its predecessor."</p>
<p>Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>, mostly recently adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-mod-support-a-barber-shop-and-over-a-thousand-fixes-and-improvements">mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Rockstar announced it was delaying the launch of GTA 6 to 2026</a>. The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026. Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track.</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is doing quite alright for itself, 'ey? The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">J'RPG</a> was awarded Rock Paper Shotgun's coveted Bestest Bests badge by our own Nic in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">review</a>, and by all accounts it's been received well by most everyone else too. Not that sales matter much in terms of a game's quality, but the fact that it's done well there as well at minimum means the lights are staying on at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sandfall-interactive">Sandfall Interactive</a>. In fact it seems things are going better than just keeping the lights on, as it sounds like the developer is considering more of it, whatever that might be.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this week, screenshots of a conversation with the game's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen on Instagram were shared on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good.1683512/">NeoGAF</a>, where she was asked if there's plans for any Clair Obscur DLC (cheers, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dlc-has-a-good-chance-of-happening-according-to-games-lead-writer/">Vice</a>). Unsurprisingly, Svedberg-Yen said that as of now, there's "nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!"
</p>
<p>
The interesting bit followed that though, as Svedberg-Yen continued, "we've always said if there is a strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good." Now, that's obviously not a confirmation of any kind. It's not even the writer saying that there'll be DLC necessarily, just that there's hopes to do more, so it's still probably best to temper your expectations.
</p>
<p>
Still, it's nice to see an underdog do so well, especially in such a busy week for RPGs. Personally I'd love to see some DLC where they pop across the border to Germany, if only to have someone put a JRPG there.
