It's a darker shade of green that references the classic aesthetic of Xbox, and it includes a black PCB and the iconic Xbox button.

Additionally, there is passthrough charging, a 2.5mm headphone jack, and support for most iPhones and Android devices.</p><p>If you're looking to pair this with other devices, 8BitDo also launched a mechanical keyboard and mouse that are also equipped with transparent green shells.

                <p>In the early '80s, the Commodore 64 was at the forefront of the home computer revolution. Now, retro publisher Ziggurat Interactive is bringing back a selection of the classic games from the C64 era in Cosmi: Forbidden Forests, which will also include a new remaster of Forbidden Forests.</p><p>1983's Forbidden Forest and its 1985 sequel, Beyond the Forbidden Forest, are both included in this compilation. But the primary attraction of Cosmi: Forbidden Forests is the modernized version of the title game that transforms the 2D art style into something that resembles a medieval tapestry. Players will have the option of toggling between the original style of Forbidden Forests and the new graphics and audio. A glimpse of the remaster is included in the announcement trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDu0WSdbhww" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nDu0WSdbhww" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The remaining games included in this retro release include Aztec Challenge, Caverns of Khafka, Seal, Delta Man, Chomp!, Chernobyl: Nuclear Power Plant Simulation, Spite &amp; Malice, and Navcom 6: The Persian Gulf Defense. These titles retain their C64 style graphics and gameplay, while adding features like the ability to rewind the action or create save states.</p><p>Comic-book veterans Ant Williams and Andy Lanning's Ideas &amp; Inks provided the compilation's new box art, and oversaw a collection of digital comics based on Forbidden Forests and Caverns of Khafka. This package also includes a digital gallery of the manuals that came with the games as well as their promotional art from the '80s.</p><p>Cosmi: Forbidden Forests will be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on May 27.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Neil Druckmann is "really curious" about how viewers will react when The Last of Us season two debuts next month.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' second season is set to air in just over two weeks time, and will pick up the lives of Joel and Ellie several years after the events of season one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">Along with awards and praise</a>, in 2023 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">first season was reported to be the most-watched HBO Max show in Europe</a>, and as such, there are some pretty high hopes for The Last of Us' second season, mine included.</p>
<p>However, as those who have played Part 2 will know, there are some plot points that may surprise and shock viewers unfamiliar with the source material. So, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> exec and showrunner Neil Druckmann nervous or scared about the reception, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">especially given some of the volatile abuse following The Last of Us Part 2</a>? Well, no, he isn't.</p>

<p>"When we're making it, we're just so focused on making it that I try not to think about what the reaction will be, but I'm very excited and curious to see what the reaction will be from people who are not familiar with the story and people who are familiar with the story, going over similarities and differences," Druckmann told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the">GameInformer</a>.</p>
<p>"I loved that conversation over season one, and I'm very much looking forward to it across season two."</p>
<p>During the same interview, Druckmann said he "used to be more concerned with fan reaction", adding he had "experienced the worst of it when [Naughty Dog] had the leaks and Covid hit with the second game", but has now "stopped caring" about all that.</p>
<p>"I've always operated under that, 'I'm not going to be worried about what the fan reaction is going to be. I don't have any control over that so I'm not going to be worried about it'.</p>
<p>"What I do have control over is the crafting of the thing that's in front of me and leading a team to do that. So I want to make sure that we make something we're extremely proud of, that we're very thoughtful in making. And then we put it out into the world and the reaction is not up to us. That's up to our fans and how they react."</p>
<p>As to <em>that</em> particular moment that may provoke reactions (won't spoil it here), well Druckmann refrained from commenting on whether or not it will feature in the second season. He dodged the Ellie-phant in the room, if you will. </p>
<p>"I'm not confirming or denying anything," Druckmann said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-%E2%80%93-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss.1146213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>From the opening strains of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s beautiful title track, it’s clear that this is an RPG that’s embracing its own sense of style. With French-language vocals and sweeping orchestration, it sets a tone for a game that feels unequivocally French. When you see the twisted remains of Paris, you’ll understand why.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsElVZ0sLtU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur begins in Lumiere, a city set within a fantastical interpretation of France. In this world, the oldest members of society die out, erased by the Paintress, who paints a number on her cursed monolith once a year, erasing everyone of that age. Each year, that number gets lower, slowly but surely edging towards zero. Clair Obscur opens with you bidding farewell to those aged 34, your love amongst them. Gustave, our central character, voiced by Daredevil star Charlie Cox, sets out as part of Expedition 33, a group dedicating the final year of their life to trying to combat this inevitable destruction of the human race, fighting back against the Paintress and her inexplicable taste for number-based death.</p>


<p>Clair Obscur is simply stunning. You should check out one of the game’s early trailers to get a true sense of it, but the team at Sandfall Interactive have captured the fantastical and the unlikely in a way that feels genuinely unique. Sunlight reflects off the dust particles floating through the air, the landscape shifts and shimmers while mist caresses your character. Looking upwards, though, it becomes clear that this is a broken land, with floating rocks and giant growths filling the purple-hued skyline. Beneath it, you soon find the ugly side of this world, coming across the remains of your Expedition, routed beneath the enemy’s banners.</p>


<p>Gustave takes this poorly, sitting amongst the fallen bodies of his bodies and manifesting a pistol that he holds to his own temple. It’s only the interjection of teammate Lune that stops him from joining them. There’s a close-run vein of darkness and depression that Clair Obscur looks to plough, and Cox’s delivery only heightens the sense of pain and loss that lies at the game’s heart. You can expect the drama and emotion to be maximised by the stellar voice cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and Final Fantasy XVI’s Ben Starr, and I found myself hanging on every word of dialogue during the preview.</p>
<p>The Expedition’s health and safety is at the centre of your experience. You can heal the entire group using Chroma Elixirs, as well as keep a watchful eye over the Expedition’s status and key objectives at any time, and this plays into the idea that this quest isn’t just about one person, it’s for every remaining member of the human race.</p>

<p>Combat is played out via turn-based battles, and the same attention to visual design found in the environment has made its way into these encounters. The UI experience has to be the most stylish we’ve seen since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio’s</a>, with your battle wheel letting you access Attacks, Skills, and Items, all of which you’ll need to utilise to prevail against Clair Obscur’s fantastical enemies.</p>
<p>There’s an active element to these turns, though, where pressing the dodge button at the right time might see you escape from damage. If you time it at the last moment, you’ll gain a Perfect Dodge and earn additional charges on your Overcharge Meter.</p>
<p>That Overcharge Meter lets you perform your most powerful attacks, and here too Clair Obscur wants you to be involved, giving Skills extra damage if you successfully time the right button press with your attack. You might wonder about the return of QTEs, or hark back to your favourite Mario RPGs, but they serve to keep you on your toes, unable to look away for a moment.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Parrying, which rather than getting you out of the way, sees you hitting a smaller window of opportunity to repel enemy attacks. If you’re able to successfully Parry multiple attacks in a row, you can answer back with a devastating counter. Parrying feels excellent here, maybe even a little overpowered, but successfully pulling one off gives you a shot of endorphins that most turn-based RPGs can only dream of.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Clair Obscur doesn’t want players to be passive observers during its turn-based battling, and it feels closer to an action title than many other RPGs. You have to be well prepared and engaged if you want to get the most out of it, getting your party through encounters in the quickest time possible, while incurring the least damage.</p>
<p>Giving you something else to think about, some characters can inflict Stains on enemies. These elemental marks can cause additional damage if you’re thoughtful about the order in which you attack, and single attacks might produce multiple effects. Lune’s Ice Lance skill inflicts both an Ice Stain and a Light Stain, and you can then consume them with opposing skills, such as a Fire Skill like Immolation. These also play into Elemental Affinities, and while some might cause additional damage, you might heal enemies if you choose the wrong one.</p>
<p>Tonally, there are aspects of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that remind me of Eternal Sonata, the JRPG set within the dying mind of Frederic Chopin. There’s the same quiet sense of the inevitable that creeps into every moment here, while the exquisite orchestration brings both melancholy and grandeur to the incredible events. There’s a darkness here that’s utterly unmatched, and while some might find the atmosphere oppressive, there’s a kernel of hope to wrap yourself around.</p>

<p>There’s plenty to juggle in Clair Obscur’s combat systems, and I came away from our preview thoroughly invested in the world and its turn-based action. For fans of role-playing games, this is one Expedition you don’t want to miss.</p>

			<p>This week, NVIDIA has added twelve games to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. This includes an exclusive first look demo at Sunderfolk, a rather unique game developed by Secret Door and published by Dreamhaven. In Sunderfolk, up to four players share the magical and dangerous world of Sunderland in a turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. The game was designed with a couch co-op experience in mind. Each player chooses one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set order of player turns, so your strategy can change on the fly to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to work together to find the best path to success.</p>
<p>In the First Look Demo (which is available on GeForce NOW through April 7), players will find:</p>
<ul>

MicroProse or whatever currently prospers under the decades-old MicroProse banner have announced that they're publishing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strategos">Strategos</a>, a real-time tactics wargame set in classical antiquity. I hadn't heard of the game before, and my first reaction to the above screenshot was "oh hey, Total War: Rome". Then I veni, vidi, vickied on over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3064810/Strategos/">Steam page</a>, and it turns out that might be a flawed comparison, not least because Strategos is the creation of a single designer and programmer with artists working on contract. Here's a trailer.

Strategos appears much more focussed on battle reenactments than Total War, with seemingly no overworld manoeuvring to worry about, though it does feature some kind of campaign element. It's also an absolute mess of factions and subfactions. There are 120 (!) armies to choose from, encompassing 250 individual units. I don't recognise most of them - Meroitic Kushites, anyone? Spanish Celtiberians? It's like watching somebody fashion shieldwalls from Haribo's back catalogue. There are five different flavours of Macedonian army alone, divvied up according to the lifespan and legacy of Alexander The Great. 
</p>
<p>
The Steam progress notes are heavy on insights about the different playstyles cultivated by these factions, and the corresponding granularity of the AI. Here's a representative excerpt from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3064810/view/621036698051019444?l=english">a post earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>"The AI has undergone various improvements to behavior and deployment. They are able to pick auto drop flanks better, move and maintain their line better, deploy and use horse archer armies more intelligently, and I've added more and better bespoke AI for Lancer lines, overwhelmingly light foot armies, medium foot armies, and bowmen deployments (including some bespoke deployments for bowmen armies that mix staggered lines of bowmen and infantry to protect their shooters, and for certain medium foot armies that will post up in terrain and draw you in with light troops/shooters). There are fixes to pursuit to charge, pursuing and evading with intervening routed units, moving and attacking coherently in formation, using more reserves, having multiple units coordinate against single targets, more intelligent evades based on matchup, pursuers pursuing other pursuers, and fixes to pathing around combats."</blockquote>

<p>
Speaking as somebody who is weary of kiting AI generals in Twarhammer, I like the sound of these intricacies, though the proof will naturally be in the pudding. I also like the sound of the game's army control system, which requires you to place generals within bellowing distance of units you wish to command, or else send a courier on horseback with their marching orders.</p>
<p>You can't, in other words, just micromanage a frontline two miles wide from the sky, like in Total War. I'm definitely more PC strategy gamer than wargamer, but this gives me pleasant memories of the old <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/close-combat">Close Combat</a> series, in which you had to worry about losing radio contact with troopers during straggly, unpredictable engagements.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, here's a rundown of bulletpoints for Strategos:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Simulate Large-Scale Battles - Command thousands of soldiers on-screen in meticulously crafted historical and speculative engagements.
</p>
<p>
- Master A New Scale Of Tactics - Experience the depth of tabletop wargaming in thrilling moment-to-moment gameplay. Strategic unit formations, morale shocks, fog of war, terrain effects, flanking maneuvers, and an advanced command and control system inspired by classic wargaming.
</p>
<p>
- Lead Armies from Across the Ancient World - Choose from over 120 factions and 250+ unique unit types, spanning nearly a thousand years of history--from Greek hoplites and Persian Immortals to the legions of Rome and the rise of the Sasanian Empire.
</p>
<p>
- Customize Your Experience - Conquer alongside the great generals of history in the Campaign mode, reenact specific historical battles, or set up custom battles within the Historical Battle Simulator. Select your army list and allies, units, maps, difficulty levels and AI behavior, or relive historical clashes such as the Battles of Issos and Raphia, with more to come!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A quick chaser: Strategos is also the name of a military training simulator created by Charles A. L. Totten for the United States Army. Published in 1880, it was revived in the 20th century and has influenced a bunch of table-top games. I imagine you can trace its impact forward into video games as well.

In the real-world card game, these are enormously popular, thanks to their rarity and novelty. Collectors love ‘em, so it’s not the loveliest move to make one of the most desirable cards locked behind such a hefty paywall.</p><p>What’s even more frustrating is that these bundles don’t even offer value for money. (Well, relative “value,” given the entire store is based on the conceit of us paying real money for imaginary “gold,” in turn to buy sealed packs with incredibly poor pull-rates. We’re paying to gamble, but the prizes don’t tangibly exist.) Inside you get 120 Poké Gold, then a bunch of meh cosmetics (coin, playmat, sleeves, a frame), and the Mewtwo card. To buy 120 Gold at the regular price would cost $20, so you’re not even getting a discount!</p><p>And to reiterate, that “Gold” doesn’t guarantee you <em>anything</em> new. I recently made a sucker of myself and bought some so I could open a bunch of packs at once—I spent $20 and got not one single card I didn’t already have, and only duplicated <em>two</em> special art cards across 20 packs. (I had seven packs in a row contain nothing but two-diamond or lower cards!) That’s the nature of gacha.</p><figure id="" data-id="104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-recommend-id="image://104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The contents of the new bundle, screenshotted from the app." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The contents of the new bundle, screenshotted from the app." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-recommend-id="image://104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The contents of the new bundle, screenshotted from the app." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you load <em>Pocket</em> today, it’ll ask for an update, which adds Shining Revelry to the app. As has been the case for the last few new sets, there’s no celebratory offer of bonus hourglasses, or fun new challenges to unlock the same. You either spend a small fortune, or you open you’re usual one or two packs. Weeeee.</p><p>There’s another small change: the game has tweaked how Wonder Picks work. The good news: it’s now far faster, without that pointless pause before shuffling. The bad news: for some godforsaken reason it now reveals the other four cards you didn’t “pick” first, so you learn you didn’t get the card you wanted <em>before</em> it reveals the bulk crap you actually got. Wow, great stuff guys. Really thinking this through.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that of the two packs I’ve opened, and the <em>eighteen</em> I can see in my Wonder Picks, not a single one of them features a shiny Pokémon. But at least you can pay $25 to guarantee getting <em>one</em> of them!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right now, no additional platforms have been confirmed or announced for <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> beyond Steam, with iOS and Android being announced (and launching) [today]. The PlayStation Store listing was simply a placeholder.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Relive the game that started it all! The original Backyard Baseball ’97, now enhanced to run on Steam. Whether you’re picking your dream team, hitting home runs, or just here for the witty banter, step back into the backyard and experience the game that made baseball fun for everyone!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Play pick-up games, practice batting, keep track of stats, compete in single games or a whole season – you can even set the rules! Backyard Baseball ‘97 features all of the realism and statistics of adult baseball games but with simple, intuitive controls that anyone can master.</p><p><strong>Batter Up, Playground Style</strong></p><p>The rules for Backyard Baseball are a hybrid of Major and Little League rules:</p><ul><li>No leading off</li><li>No Injuries</li><li>Bunting is allowed</li><li>Tagging up is allowed</li><li>You can also practice batting</li></ul><p>To get into the swing of things, choose a batter and face Mr. Clanky for some batting practice. This is where you’ll learn just when to click to make your chosen batter hit that ball!</p><p><strong>One Nation Under Pablo</strong></p><p>For many fans, this is the game that debuted one of the most iconic video game characters of the 90s or any era—the legend himself, Pablo Sanchez. Build a roster from a cast of 30 hilarious child athletes who made Backyard Baseball a cult classic.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Random Pick-Up</strong> – A quick way to jump right in! The computer chooses a random team for you and itself, and the game starts immediately.</li><li><strong>Single Game</strong> – You take turns with the computer, choosing players from a random pool of characters.</li><li><strong>Season</strong> – You create a team and manage the team through a 14 game series. The opposing teams are computer generated. At the end of the season the best two teams advance to the BBL playoffs (best of three). The playoffs winner advances to the championship series which consists of the Super Entire Nation Tournament (best of three) and then the Ultra Grand Championship of the Universe Series (best of five)!</li></ul><p><strong>Global Leaderboard</strong></p><p>Compete globally! Steam’s Leaderboard system lets you compete with friends and players around the world. Track your home runs, strike-outs, grand slams, season wins and more in real-time. See how you stack up and strive to reach the top!</p><p>At our core, we are fans first–not just of video games but of the Backyard Sports franchise. Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original Backyard titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t support gamepads, nor the Steam deck, in these original titles. We can’t use the original 32bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p><p>We can make the game run buttery smooth, stack it with Steam achievements to test your mettle and give you a chance to batter up to compete in the Steam Global Leaderboards for Home Runs. Baseball 1997 runs well, looks better than ever, and creates a new installation for digital preservation within the Backyard Sports catalog that allows the next generation of fans to fall in love with the title that started it all.</p><p><strong>Development</strong></p><p>With the original source code lost in the years since the 1997 release, Playground Productions has teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the original titles and bring them to modern devices. Forming a team of avid gamers and <em>Backyard Sports</em> enthusiasts, Mega Cat accomplished a near-impossible feat by hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds to be compatible with current generation PCs. It was a meticulous process that took a considerable amount of time and effort to revitalize the game. Given the intricacies involved in this remaster, <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> is only compatible with PC devices at this time, but both Mega Cat and Playground Productions are working diligently to ensure <em>Backyard Sports</em> becomes available on multiple platforms moving forward.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>So, it turns out that I've been pronouncing Balatro wrong all this time, and now feel like a total spade. I really don't know how to <em>deal</em> with this revelation, it's left me rather <em>flush</em>-ed. </p>
<p>I have been saying B-<strong>LAH</strong>-tro, but that's not exactly how the deckbuilder's anonymous developer pronounces it. According to Naman Budhwar - that is to say, the head of video marketing at Balatro publisher Playstack - LocalThunk puts the emphasis on the 'Bah' in Balatro.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-to-say-balatro">GameFile's Stephen Totilo</a>, Budhwar said LocalThunk pronounces the name of his roguelike deckbuilder thus: "<strong>BAH</strong>-luh-trow."</p>
<p>So, my almost throw away effort on the B is not what its maker calls the game. Whoops!</p>
<p>Not that it sounds like LocalThunk will really mind my poor pronunciation, though. Budhwar said it was kind of like "a 'gif/jif' situation", and people can just say Balatro the way that feels right for them  (for the record, I say gif with a hard G).</p>
<p>"He doesn’t really mind how people say it," Budhwar said of LocalThunk, to which Totilo jokingly asked if pronouncing it "<strong>BAY</strong>-la-tro" would still fly.</p>
<p>"Sure, you can say BAY-la-tro, yeah," Budhwar replied, but I am not sure that will ever stick. To paraphrase Regina George, stop trying to make BAY-la-tro happen.</p>
<p>I am curious, what do you call it?</p>

            <p>A voice actor from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> has been recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike, causing others to come out in support.</p>
<p>John Patneaude was the voice of Kinich in the free-to-play adventure from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a>, but in a statement shared on social media they revealed they have been recast due to the strike over AI protections.</p>
<p>"I've been withholding voice-over services during the SAG-AFTRA Interactive Strike because Hoyo/Cognosphere wouldn't offer AI protections in the form of a SAG Interim Agreement," they said. "They'd kept my character's dialogue silent for months, all the while I had made the difficult decision to continue not going in until an interim agreement was signed and this ultimately was why I was recast."</p>

<p>They continued: "Now obviously, a recast is not what I wanted. I'd hoped that any progress behind the scenes would be made and I could come back safely, or that if recast auditions went out my colleagues wouldn't read for them. Unfortunately, I was wrong."</p>
<p>Patneaude described Genshin Impact as a "comfort game during the early parts of the pandemic" and called the role a "dream".</p>
<p>"I would and can return if Hoyo invites me back and signs an interim," they concluded. "I stand by my choices regardless of the outcome. Also, the strike is still ongoing - please don't believe disinformation on the internet."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following Patneaude's recasting, other voice actors from Genshin Impact have come out in support.</p>
<p>Paimon voice actor Corina Boettger has been particularly vocal, <a href="https://x.com/thebirdzulu/status/1904948378838167802">stating on social media</a>: "There is a HUGE difference when you take the role of an actor who is striking for AI protections. You are no castmate of mine."</p>
<p>Replying to a response asking what to do in Hoyo's shoes, Boettger said: "I would sign the SAG interim agreement so that all my actors can have AI protections and then they could come back right away to voice these characters with no gap."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1904969482675884332">Albedo actor Khoi Dao</a> said: "Any video game can bring back their FULL voice cast IMMEDIATELY during the strike, once they agree to enforceable AI protections via a SAG interim agreement, and the game CAN still keep its non-union actors after doing so.</p>
<p>"This is not a union actor vs non-union actor conflict. The goal of the strike is to ensure that this craft isn't lost to AI. We've got a common goal, which is why so many NU actors are holding the line alongside their U cast mates, despite having no obligation to do so."</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">similar situation with HoYoVerse's other game, Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, both Emeri Chase and Nicholas Thurkettle were recast due to the ongoing strike, and only found out once the game's latest patch went live.</p>
<p>Recording studio Sound Cadence Studios responded to the news at the time, stating: "Every contract at our studio features explicit AI protections, regardless of union status. Much of our staff are actors themselves, and could not in good conscience offer other performers work we would not be willing to take."</p>
<p>It added: "We respect the decisions of all actors in navigating the ongoing strike, and fully support SAG-AFTRA in its AI negotiations."</p>
<p>HoYoVerse itself is yet to publicly comment. Eurogamer has contacted the company for a statement.</p>

			<p>Mario Kart 9 may not be an instant smashing success on Nintendo Switch 2 due to the incredible popularity its predecessor still enjoys today, according to former Nintendo of America employees.</p>
<p>In a new video, former Nintendo of America employees Kit and Krysta discussed the next entry in the series, which was the only game shown during the brief Nintendo Switch 2 reveal back in January, saying that it may have a hard time matching the success of Mario Kart 8, at least in the beginning, due to how successful the game is and how it continues to be an extremely popular game due to the support it has received for years after release. Given how difficult it may be for a kid, for example, to convince a parent to purchase a brand-new system just to play Mario Kart 9, which may not look that different from its predecessor to the uninitiated eye, the two former Nintendo employees think that it will be difficult for the game to do better than the 75 million copies the game sold to date combining the sales of the original Wii U release and the Deluxe Switch release. An amazing result, considering how the Switch port was almost an afterthought after the sales of the Wii U release, which were far from amazing.</p>

<p>While much of the Nintendo Switch 2's launch success will likely rely on Mario Kart 9, it's unlikely the new entry in the series will be the system's only<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/"> first-party launch title</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars Of Eternity</a> turns 10 years old this week, and developers Obsidian are celebrating with a patch that "addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more". Oh, and they've also announced plans to give the real-time-with-pausing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> a turn-based combat mode. 
</p>
<p>
What did you get for your 10th birthday? If it wasn't a turn-based combat mode, then your parents officially love you less than Obsidian does Pillars Of Eternity. You might want to bring that up at the next family gathering. I'm already texting my dad.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The forum post revealing all this shares little about how the new turn-based system will work, but I think we can all agree that developers should capriciously add turn-based modes to games more often. I, for one, hope to see more development teams digging up ancient real-time games and sadistically grafting on initiative stats and order bars, like Frankenstein wannabes going through a Clockwork phase. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine if instead of a bunch of cannabis-skinned AK47s and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">seemingly AI-generated anime women</a>, the next Call Of Duty content plop transformed Warzone into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. Imagine if Street Fighter had a dual-turn system derived from deckbuilders, with players queuing up attacks simultaneously. (This has been done, yes? Surely it's been done. One of the Puzzle Fighter variants, perhaps.)</p>
<p>With hand on heart, I cannot think of a real-time game I wouldn't love to rediscover as a turn-based game - it worked out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-review">wonderfully</a> for Gears Of War. Admittedly, this is partly because I am very elderly for a games journalist and now fear and despise any game that expects me to outmaneouvre anything faster than a soap bubble.
</p>
<p>
The other positive here, I guess, is that it's a smidgeon of reassurance for people who worry that the Pillars universe will be first-person real-time from here on out, given the apparent success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. Perhaps Avowed will get a turn-based mode next? Something in the vein of Sega's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, perhaps? Anyway, Obsidian will be soliciting playtesters for their new mode "in the near future". As for that new patch, <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the full changelog is here</a>.

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will get additional content for free sometime in May, the game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543353138838503653?l=english"> Dev Note post</a> detailing the game's very first balance patch, Creative Director Junho Lee confirmed that a free DLC content update will be released sometime in May. As the new content is still in development, more details will be shared once it's closer to completion. Additional updates featuring some unspecified improvements will also be released in the near future, some of them as early as next week.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new The First Berserker: Khazan balance patch was released today to mark the game's official release following a few days of early access. As part of an effort to keep the game challenging yet fair, the developers introduced some balance adjustments, which include increased damage for the Greatsword Brutal Attack skill, a resource cost adjustment for the Phantom: Heatwave Spear skill, some boss balance adjustments, such as reduced difficulty for the Viper and Maluca boss fights, increased power of certain bosses that felt weaker than they should have, improved benefits for Easy Mode and more.</p>
<p>While I found The First Berserker: Khazan to be a balanced game overall, I had very little doubt that the Maluca boss fight would be adjusted following release, as it was one of the most difficult bosses in the game, requiring excellent knowledge of all the defensive options the game has to offer. Hopefully, these balance adjustments will help more players get into the game, as it is an action RPG that is more than worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/"> review.</a></p>
