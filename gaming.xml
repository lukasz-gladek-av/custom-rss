			<p>What’s the deal with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/contraband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contraband</a>, the Xbox-published co-op game coming from Just Cause and Rage 2 developer Avalanche Studios? The project was announced back in 2021, and that’s about all we’ve heard about it. That said, with a big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> coming up, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-is-targeting-2025-contraband-might-launch-this-year-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old rumors that Contraband may be targeting 2024</a>, some have got their hopes up that we may see the game soon.</p>
<p>Well, you may want to cool your jets. On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Oc0705wD0WA?si=qWrLIOzeNi4Gafzy&amp;t=3705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent episode of Colt Eastwood’s Xbox News Cast</a>, one of the hosts Magg said Contraband isn’t coming until “well into” 2025 as the game is still in a rough state.</p>
<p><em>“I've been told it's been delayed. It's going to be delayed well into 2025, could be the end of 2025. But, the people that I know, the footage that I saw, the people that played the game and sent me all their [...] impromptu reviews of what they played, they said the game is fun, it was great. It was a very early build. [...] Like, the cars didn't have drivers in them, you couldn't see their heads, it was literally ghost cars driving around.”</em></p>
<p>Now, this Magg doesn’t necessarily have much of a leaking track record, but during the podcast, The Verge’s Tom Warren, who does have a long, reliable track record, popped up in the comments section to confirm “Contraband is a ways off, for sure.”</p>
<p>Of course, take this all with a grain of salt for now, but it sounds like Contraband is not something Xbox is preparing to launch in the immediate future. In related news, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/just-cause-developer-avalanche-closing-two-studios-and-laying-off-50-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche recently announced the closure of two North American studios</a> located in New York and Montreal, resulting in around 50 layoffs (that represents around a 10th of their total workforce). This leaves Avalanche with three main European studios located in Stockholm, Liverpool, and Malmo, Sweeden. Whether this downsizing has anything to do with the somewhat slow progress being made on Contraband is unknown.</p>
<p>Contraband is currently slated to release on PC and Xbox Series X/S. An official launch window has not been announced.</p>

                <p>Harvest Moon: One World is getting a new Complete Edition for Nintendo Switch that will bundle the base game with all post-launch DLC for $30. Harvest Moon: One World Complete launches on <strong>August 13</strong>, and preorders for the physical edition are now available online. You can even get a limited-edition plush with the game while supplies last.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Harvest Moon: One World preorder bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4305529-oneworldplush.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305529" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4305529-oneworldplush.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305529"></a><figcaption>Harvest Moon: One World Comeplete Yeti plush preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4305529-oneworldplush.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first batch of physical edition Harvest Moon: One World Complete preorders will include a special plush character based on the Yeti creature you can encounter in-game. So far, the Yeti plush is only listed as a bonus if you preorder directly from Natsume; the Amazon listing does not mention the bonus plush. However, since Amazon doesn't charge for preorders until your order ships, you could secure your copy early at both locations and wait to see if the plush is confirmed for Amazon, then cancel one of the orders before launch.</p><div title="6523580 - Harvest Moon: One World Complete" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2391" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523580 - Harvest Moon: One World Complete" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Harvest Moon: One World Complete</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Harvest Moon: One World Complete is an expanded version of the game, which originally launched in 2021 for Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The initial release featured five explorable world regions and 10 romanceable NPCs, but the post-launch paid DLC boosted that content to six total regions and 12 romanceable characters, alongside additional house decorations, pets, and other items to collect. All that extra content is included with the new Complete version. You can preorder Harvest Moon: Complete Edition for $30 at Amazon, or at <a href="https://natsumestore.com/products/pre-order-harvest-moon-one-world-complete-with-free-sasquatch-plush" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Natsume's online store</a>. </p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Harvest Moon: One World iterates on the long-running series' farming and life-sim gameplay, turning it into a more exploration-based adventure with elements that seem heavily inspired by Pokemon. Players create their own character and then embark on a quest to collect Harvest Wisps hidden throughout the world that unlock new crops in their "Vegedex" that can be farmed with the new portable "expando-farm."</p><p dir="ltr">While the game was met with mixed reception from critics and fans, this new Complete edition's $30 price tag and comprehensive content package will likely be the best way to experience the game for Switch players. That said, if you don't want to wait--or don't play on Switch--you can also grab the original release at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-One-World-Xbox/dp/B09BDWPNKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 on Xbox One</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-One-World-Standard-PlayStation/dp/B08FBVCGPF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>.

<p data-characters="449" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you are a frequent player of <em>Destiny 2</em>, you’ll be caught up and ready to go as soon as you are able to get into <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. However, if you’ve never played <em>Destiny 2</em> or haven’t played in a long time, tons of content has been added and it can be a bit difficult figuring out how to get into the new expansion content. This is the fastest way to start <em>The Final Shape</em> for those new and returning <em>Destiny 2</em> players.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-skip-ahead-to-destiny-2-the-final-shape-content" data-injectable="false">How to skip ahead to <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> content</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="true">As a new player who has not played <em>Destiny 2</em> at all, you will have one extra step over those that are returning after a long hiatus. Create your character and start <em>Destiny 2</em> which will plop you into the Cosmodrome region on Earth. This is essentially the beginning of the game, but don’t worry; you only have to do the first mission. Once you reach the end, you’ll get a quest that tasks you with speaking to Commander Shaw which is also located in the same Cosmodrome region as you and should be highlighted on your map.</p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Once you have completed the initial tutorial mission, here is the fastest way to start <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion content in <em>Destiny 2</em>:</p> <ol data-found-items="4" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false"> <li>Find Commander Shaw.</li> <li>Skip the New Light quest and acquire your New Light Kit at the Tower.</li> <li>Visit Commander Zavala at the Tower and reach Guardian Rank 2.</li> <li>Return to Zavala to start The Final Shape quest and unlock The Pale Heart.</li> </ol> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">Here is a detailed walkthrough for each step you must complete to unlock and access <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion as soon as possible:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-find-commander-shaw" data-injectable="false">Find Commander Shaw</h3> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Speak to Shaw and he will tell you to sync up with his ship, which is located right behind him and to the left. This will unlock two new quests, one titled A Guardian Rises which tasks you with progressing through the original <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign, and another called Learning Light which is what you are looking for. Once you start the Learning Light quest you can return to the flag where you synched with Shaw’s ship, and you will now see the option to Skip New Light.</p>
 <h3 id="h-skip-new-light-and-acquire-your-new-light-kit" data-injectable="false">Skip New Light and acquire your New Light Kit</h3> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Doing so will skip ahead and allow you to bypass completing the story missions, which will unlock the Tower and a new campaign quest specific to your class. Visit the Tower and head to the class NPC marked by your quest objective to acquire your New Light Kit which is essentially a set of starter gear that you would normally have the equivalent of if you actually played through the original campaign story missions.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-visit-zavala-at-the-tower-and-reach-guardian-rank-2" data-injectable="false">Visit Zavala at the Tower and reach Guardian Rank 2</h3> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="813" data-injectable="true">Afterward, you will be tasked with heading to Zavala to continue the Spark of Hope questline. It will seem as though it’s making you go through the entire quest line, but I assure you it’s not. Zavala gives you the objective of hitting Guardian Rank 2, which simply requires you to open your Character screen, hit the Journey tab, then click to level up to Guardian Rank 2. Head to the Ironwood Tree right next to you at the Tower and you will officially progress to rank 2 and complete the objective.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-return-to-zavala-and-start-the-final-shape-quest-and-unlock-the-pale-heart-destination" data-injectable="false">Return to Zavala and start The Final Shape quest and unlock The Pale Heart destination</h3> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Finally, head back to Zavala which is nearby on the Tower and speak to him. Confirm you’ve reached Guardian Rank 2 and as long as you have purchased <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> expansion, he will now give you the breadcrumb quest to start the expansion titled The Final Shape and will also unlock the new area for the expansion called The Pale Heart.</p>
 <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="98" data-injectable="false">Congratulations, you’re all caught up and ready to start playing <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>!</p>

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em> is the game’s final major expansion and adds everything a fan could want and more. There are new enemies, a brand new location to explore, and a showdown with the biggest baddie the universe has ever seen, The Witness. </p> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Players will battle against The Witness in the new raid that <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> adds. This raid, Salation’s Edge, will see players head out and face The Witness in a colossal battle between light and darkness. It’ll settle the fate of this universe once and for all. However, before players can even contemplate jumping into the raid, they’ll need to reach the right Power Level. This is the in-game level of their Guardian and is based on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their gear</a> and weapon levels, meaning we’ve all got some grinding to do. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-power-level-do-you-need-to-play-the-salvation-s-edge-raid-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">What Power Level do you need to play the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">To play the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salvation’s Edge raid</a> in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, players must be at least <strong>Power Level 1965</strong>. Players have three days to reach this level, which will not be easy. Playing through the entire campaign on Legendary will get you most of the way, but there’s also an Exotic Quest and, of course, a lot of grinding you can do in the new activities in The Pale Heart to help you reach that lofty Power Level. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to grind Power Levels in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">To grind Power Levels in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> in preparation for the Salvation’s Edge raid, players need to log in daily and complete every activity that will give them powerful rewards. This includes weekly and daily rewards for activities everywhere in the game, be that Crucible, Gambit, Strikes, or The Pale Heart. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Note that you should be doing this after completing <em>The Final Shape</em> campaign on Legendary. If you don’t, you’re going to struggle to hit the required Power Level in time for the raid’s launch. If you don’t mind, you can grind away in the background without stressing. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">These rewards will give you gear that’s guaranteed to be stronger than what you currently hold, so equip your most powerful items every time you close in on a powerful reward. The new location will also be filled with new activities to complete for your profile, many of which could end up giving you more of the gear you seek. </p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">The one thing I always do is make sure I have as many bounties as possible. These help you grind out Season Pass levels but also count towards powerful rewards with all vendors. The more you complete, the higher your chances of getting a random yet very strong piece of gear that’ll help you close in on that raid-ready Power Level. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">Finally, keep on top of your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-artifact-perks-coming-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifact</a>. This item opens up some great mods you can use on your gear and weapons, and every level you earn for it counts towards your Power Level. If you’re grinding for the raid, even a single Power Level added here counts for those desperate to play on day one. </p>

You should be able to find it in The Pale Heart location, which is inside of the Traveler in the middle of the screen. </p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="false">Note that the raid won’t be available until <strong>June 7, 20224, at 1 p.m. ET</strong>. This is when Contest Mode will be enabled for all the registered teams to hop in and try to be the first in the world to complete it. It’s unknown what will happen once the raid has been completed, but recent raids have all changed the game world in some way, opening up new activities. So it’s worth keeping an eye on the standings even if you’re not playing. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced.889782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the TTRPG community, Roll20 is one of the largest virtual tabletop platforms on the market. It boasts one of the largest libraries of resources and hosts millions of games every day. Now, that platform will have more resources with an official Roll20 Demiplane acquisition.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition was covered in a report by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/roll20-announces-purchase-of-demiplane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comicbook.com</a>. According to the report, the purchase goes into effect today, providing Roll20 with a suite of character creation tools that can work in tandem with the VTT and online marketplace DriveThruRPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=roQyzWMV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=tRvN-0Rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of convenience may be coming to Roll20.</figcaption></figure><p>For those unaware, Demiplane is a VTT known for its robust suite of character-creation tools and RPG resource compendiums. Its closest competition in terms of convenience and usability on the market is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-buys-up-dd-beyond-from-fandom">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. Demiplane's supported titles include Paizo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus">Pathfinder</a>, Paradox Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane"><em>World of Darkness</em></a>, and Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/demiplane-partners-with-darrington-press-to-launch-candela-obscura-nexus"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>In an interview with Roll20's CEO, Ankit Lai explained the reason for the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition. Lai explained that it was to further Roll20's goal of creating a seamless user experience. This aligns with the platform's past partnerships, providing user-created content through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dms-guild-content-now-on-roll20">DMs Guild</a> or easy battlemap creation through <a href="https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/16979743281943-Getting-Started-with-Dungeon-Scrawl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeon Scrawl</a>.</p>

<p>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition won't have any immediate impact on users, but Demiplane CEO Peter Romenesko noted that merged companies will look to close the difference between their two platforms very quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What you'll see is a very concentrated effort to bring the distance between each of these different solutions that are now under the Roll20 brand, really start to bring them closer. Both in digital proximity so that all of a sudden you can start to use these things across the whole platform, whether you're playing in person or online....You may not notice [these changes] one by one, but it's something that we're really committed to. In addition, we'll continue to bring out a whole bunch of great games on our platform and find out really unique ways to bring Demiplane into DriveThruRPG and the virtual tabletop."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing which game systems will support Demiplane character sheet integration on Roll20. However, it is confirmed this acquisition will allow the support of playtest material for upcoming systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> fast approaching, the development team at Square Enix are doing everything in their power to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-begins-testing-cross-region-data-center-travel-later-this-month/">ease the expected congestion</a> when it comes to logging in around release.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The latest move is to provide players with more choices for their home world by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/93750e4b0d6d5a4faf6a00dee199082392f1a754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating four new worlds</a> on the existing North American Data Center, Dynamis. The DC has been running at half capacity since its launch in 2022, with four worlds, as opposed to the normal eight per DC.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The four new worlds will be added on June 11 at 3 a.m. PDT / 6 a.m. EST, bringing the following new worlds live and ready for new or existing players to populate:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Cuchulainn</li> <li>Golem</li> <li>Kraken</li> <li>Rafflesia</li> </ul> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">On top of boosting the capacity of North American servers, the four new worlds will also have completely empty housing districts, which is potentially the most exciting aspect of this news for a lot of people.</p> <h2 id="h-how-housing-works-on-new-worlds-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How housing works on ‘new’ worlds in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it, getting a house in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is never easy, even with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-housing-lottery-explained/">Lottery system</a> which was introduced in patch 6.1. However, being an early entrant into a brand new world can significantly boost your chances of getting your dream Eorzean home.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">All of these up for grabs plots will all be subject to the same conditions as any other as part of the Housing Lottery, with wards 1 to 9 being exclusively available to those seeking a base for their FC, while wards 10 to 24 will be reserved for players wanting a private residential oasis.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">For those who are interested in transferring to one of these new worlds but worried about giving up any property they already own on your current world, don’t fret. If you choose to up sticks, you’ll actually be eligible for a pretty hefty boost in funds. Not only will the full price of the estate you own be fully reimbursed, but you’ll also get 3,000,000 Gil for your willingness to leave your old world behind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">In the case of apartments, you’ll get the 500,000 Gil that you paid for the apartment back and also a bonus of another 500,000 Gil.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">However, it’s worth noting that if you choose to do this, you’ll need to keep hold of your current property while going through the Home World Transfer process. If you give up the rights to your property before the process is completed, you won’t be eligible to receive any bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">On top of these housing perks, there are also some other good reasons to transfer to a new world:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"> <li>The <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/option_service/world_transfer_service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home World Transfer Service</a> is free of charge (usually costs $18.00 USD)</li> <li>You’ll receive 10 Gold Chocobo Feathers, which can be exchanged for the following: <ul> <li>Managarm mount (8 feathers)</li> <li>Amber Draught Chocobo (8 feathers)</li> <li>Twintania Neurolink Key (15 feathers)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Double EXP bonus until level 80 is achieved</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="151" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 2024 World Series of <em>Warzone</em> has officially kicked off, and it didn’t take long for chaos to ensue in the first round of qualifying matches. </p> <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzon</em>e pro Fifakill posted a clip on <a href="https://x.com/Fifakill_/status/1798024779175543030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> of CHOWH and his teammates getting killed by a loadout drop during a <em>World Series of Warzone</em> EU qualifying match. Despite driving in an LTV, one of the best-armored vehicles in the battle royale, the trio stood no chance against a loadout drop that fell from the sky. Upon driving into the crate, the vehicle blew up and all three players got downed. To add insult to injury, the squad got finished off by an airstrike. CHOWH could do nothing but sit in disbelief as he saw his team fall victim to quite an unfortunate turn of events. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">BubbleCT and his trio called in the loadout drop, and he <a href="https://x.com/BubbleCT_/status/1798030870814814539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “Shout out to our loadout, lmao.” Bubble had no intention of using the loadout drop of a weapon, but he certainly won’t apologize, as every kill matters in the <em>World Series of Warzon</em>e. From June 4-12, NA and EU qualifiers take place. Out of the 80 teams for both regions, only 68 will move on based on their performances throughout 15 matches. </p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="false">That group of 68 is divided even further based on their performance during the qualifying stages, so every game matters. Hence, losing one of those 15 matches like this is unquestionably frustrating. Unfortunately for CHOWH, his trio currently sits in 30th place with 28 points after the first five matches. And that’s before the second group of 40 teams play their first five matches. Luckily there are still 10 matches left, and CHOWH has plenty of time to regroup. </p>

Players sent thousands of emails to Valve and outlets like <em>Kotaku </em>and <em>IGN,</em> trying to get attention on the issue. And it worked! Valve, the company behind Steam and <em>Half-Life</em>, acknowledged the bot problem and said it was working on fixing things. That was about two years ago and uh...well, the bots are still here and still making the game hard to play. </p><h2 id="h191593"><a id=""></a>Fans want Valve to save <em>Team Fortress 2</em></h2><p>On June 3, a new fan campaign started up. And like last time, players are trying to get Valve to step in and do something about all the annoying bots. This time, the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://save.tf/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fix TF2" campaign</a></span> is asking for player signatures, which will be delivered to Valve in the future. So far the site has collected over 210,000 signatures and the number keeps climbing. </p><p>“There’s no putting it lightly, <em>Team Fortress 2</em> is in an unacceptable state, and Valve’s apathy in dealing with the issue is nothing short of appalling,” claims a message on the “Fix TF2" site. </p><p>The campaign’s mission statement asks Valve to implement updated anti-cheat measures for the aging <em>TF2</em>, which still makes money every year via microtransactions. The fans also want an open line of communication with Valve about the state of the game and the bot problem.</p><p>As someone who has spent years emailing Valve for comments and answers as part of my job and received very few responses, I wish you all good luck with getting them to communicate more. Speaking of which, <em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Valve about <em>TF2</em>'s bots. </p><p>To help get Valve’s attention, the website is asking fans to share stories, screenshots, and clips of bots in <em>TF2 </em>on social media. It is also asking fans to share the campaign’s website, too. Nowhere on the site does it ask fans to review-bomb <em>TF2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but that’s also happening right now as well</a></span>, likely as a result of angry players wanting to get Valve to do something. </p><p>Valve has yet to officially respond to the campaign as of June 4, 2024. The official <em>TF2 </em>Twitter account’s last tweet was... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last time Valve replied</a></span> to fans complaining about bots in 2022. So we shall see if <em>TF2</em>'s second tweet in nearly two years is yet another promise that fixes are coming. Last time that worked to calm fans down. This time...I’m not sure.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I tend to have an indie or two each year that I don't shut up about. Five years ago, Blue Manchu's roguelite strategy-shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/void-bastards/" data-ref-id="5000-489272">Void Bastards</a>, was <em>that</em> game for me. Now, studio Blue Manchu is back with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-bastards/" data-ref-id="5000-611497">Wild Bastards</a>, a spiritual successor that retains the sci-fi of the first one but adds a western element to it while expanding and deepening the game's systems. On top of that, the replacement-level characters, who served Void Bastards satirical story well, are swapped out for a Dirty (baker's) Dozen of voiced characters, each of whom has their own personalities and relationships with others in the gang.</p><p>Put it all together, and you have a game that seems, in my admittedly limited sample, to be even better than its excellent predecessor. With the full game due to launch later this year, I caught up with Blue Manchu's creative director Ben Lee to talk about how the team landed on another game in the loose "Bastards" series, what lessons it learned from that first game that made Wild Bastards better off, and where the studio may go from here as it continues to create visually captivating and mechanically complex games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEmsVc9GxrE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cEmsVc9GxrE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>GameSpot: Wild Bastards has a lot of the same DNA as Void Bastards, but it's not a sequel. Can you talk about how this game found its shape in the years since Void Bastards? When did the team decide to develop another game in the same genre?</strong></p><p>Lee: We started pre-production about three months after the release of Void Bastards. We started out with a fairly broad remit, and the game took a long time to fully take shape.</p><p>Wild Bastards is all about playing a myriad of distinct characters, instead of a procession of random prisoners. We put a lot of effort into their unique playstyles, visuals and fully-voiced dialogue as you play through the narrative campaign.</p><p>Wild Bastards certainly has strategy/shooter DNA, but we have focused on much more complex combat encounters this time. The combat spaces are no longer just corridors and rooms, and the strategic factors that tie into each encounter go much deeper. Most importantly, the enemy variety and behaviors are significantly more varied and nuanced than the monsters in Void Bastards.</p><p><strong>Were there any obvious successes you knew would carry over from Void Bastards when you were developing Wild Bastards? On the flipside, were there any lessons VB taught you that you sought to rework or even remove in WB?</strong></p><p>There were plenty of both! The main thing we carried over was probably more on the technical and production side. We didn’t have to completely rethink the way we built the game thanks to all the problem solving we did on Void Bastards.</p><p>Outside of that, we often internally referred to things that we felt did or did not work well in Void Bastards, but we did not think of this game as a Void Bastards variant or sequel. We wanted it to be unshackled from that game as far as our design space went.</p><p>The initial versions of the game did not even have space travel as it is implemented now. It was much more of a huge planetary map exploration thing. But as time went on, we felt that we had more to offer in the strategy hybrid area and we leaned back that way instead of going a more RPG route.</p><p><strong>More broadly, the roguelite/roguelike space is so densely populated--on PC especially. What's it like sharing digital real estate with so many games trying to appeal to similar players?</strong></p><p>There is not quite yet an oversaturation of strategy-shooter hybrid roguelikes as far as we see things. Maybe that will change in future, but for now I think there’s plenty of room for different takes on the games in this loose genre.</p><p><strong>Void Bastards was inspired by BioShock and System Shock 2. What are the main inspirations for Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>I can only speak on the thematic influences to the look and feel. I was raised by a mother who loved sci-fi and a father who loved westerns. Wild Bastards creative direction was inspired mostly by cinema. Namely the Sergio Leone Dollars trilogy, The Magnificent Seven (1960), Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), MTV’s Liquid Television from the late '90s, Muse’s Knights of Cydonia music video, Suspiria (1977) and Mandy (2018).</p><p><strong>Does Blue Manchu have aspirations beyond games of this size and scope or might you always want to create games such as Void Bastards and Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>As long as we can make games, we will make games. If we end up in a position where we can make games with more resources, it's certainly something we’d be open to.</p><p><strong>To that end, is there a future third Bastards game in the team's mind? After space sci-fi and westerns, is there another narrative genre you'd like to explore?</strong></p><p>Yes. But it’s a secret for now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311282-enemies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311282" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311282-enemies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311282"></a><figcaption>Each gunslinger has their own ultimate ability and can otherwise be kitted out with buffs and gear to suit different situations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311282-enemies.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311283-wildbastards-bayoumap.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311284-wildbastards-warp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311285-wildbastards-outlaw.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311286-wildbastards-equip.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311287-wildbastards-hostilenohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311288-wildbastards-bayounohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311289-wildbastards-desertnohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311290-wildbastards-roulette.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311291-spiderrosaexplosion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311283,1300-4311284,1300-4311285,1300-4311286,1300-4311287,1300-4311288,1300-4311289,1300-4311290,1300-4311291" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311283-wildbastards-bayoumap.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311284-wildbastards-warp.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311285-wildbastards-outlaw.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311286-wildbastards-equip.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311287-wildbastards-hostilenohud.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311288-wildbastards-bayounohud.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311289-wildbastards-desertnohud.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311290-wildbastards-roulette.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4311291-spiderrosaexplosion.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311283-wildbastards-bayoumap.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311284-wildbastards-warp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311285-wildbastards-outlaw.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311286-wildbastards-equip.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311287-wildbastards-hostilenohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311288-wildbastards-bayounohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311289-wildbastards-desertnohud.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311290-wildbastards-roulette.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4311291-spiderrosaexplosion.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Both games have a certain sense of humor that prevents them from feeling gloomy or serious, even when I'm running for my life. Can you talk about why the team leans toward this lighter tone and why you think it works for these games?</strong></p><p>Void Bastards was originally very serious and quite depressing in tone. Midway through the project, we decided to keep it quite dark but approach it from a more comedic angle. Cara and I both have a lot of appreciation for Douglas Adams, Terry Gilliam, and Red Dwarf, so that was what got us to bring her on board to write.</p><p>Wild Bastards was originally supposed to be more serious, but once we began the writing process with our old friend Jerry [Holkin, writer for Void Bastards], his sense of humor naturally worked its way into the fiction and dialogue. None of us complained.</p><p><strong>Did you ever consider moving away from the comic-book art style for Wild Bastards? Why did you end up back with this style in the end?</strong></p><p>The conceptual designs come from the same person (me), but Wild Bastards is actually less directly a comic book than Void Bastards. There is no cover page, no panel borders or visual onomatopoeia sound effects for example. Wild Bastards is more in line with a kind of acid trippy traditional animation as visual style. I would still be keen to return to a more intricate comic book/graphic novel look for a future game, to see how much further we could push it.</p><p><strong>WB's systems feel so intricate and layered. Is there ever a point in development when you must rein it in to avoid overcomplicating the game? How do you know when the game's systems have the right depth without becoming too deep?</strong></p><p>Short answer: Yes. I think all our games are too complicated at some point in development and it’s that editing process of trimming and refining that is so important to arriving at a final experience that feels right.</p><p>We had a lot more playtesting and user feedback on Wild Bastards, which had a much stronger impact on the final game than previous titles. Sometimes it’s the things you take out that have a bigger positive impact than all the stuff you cram in.</p><p><strong>The game features 13 playable gunslingers. I assume others were designed but ultimately left out. What made these characters the ones to make the cut? Do you have any favorites, or any expectations as to who players will gravitate toward?</strong></p><p>Ultimately it was how much fun the outlaw was to play and their place in the overall meta that determined which ones we kept. We started with in-game mockups for each one before going ahead with visual design or dialogue. When drawing the concepts, I had definite favorites, but by the time we had them all playable and voiced, I loved them all equally. That’s not a cop-out answer; it’s more of a testament to the way they developed through writing and recording.</p><p>Playtesters have had a really varied spread of opinions over the most effective or favorite character to use, which is exactly what we wanted to see. Some outlaws seem OP until they run into a particular set of enemies, or useless until certain strategies are discovered. It’s this variety and depth that really sets the game apart from our previous efforts.</p><p><strong>Do you have any post-launch plans for Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>We are currently full speed ahead on getting the game ready to ship, which requires all of our attention… But check back with us post-launch for answers to that question!</p><hr><p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist Wild Bastards on Steam</a> before it arrives on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch on September 12.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring's</a> highly anticipated DLC, Shadow Of The Erdtree, is quickly approaching. As we get closer to its June 21 release date, more information about the DLC is beginning to surface, such as how many new bosses lie ahead and how a new feature will allow you to adjust the game’s difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will notice a new menu option called Shadow Realm Blessing whenever they visit a Guidance of Grace. This will serve as a new progression system for their character that will allow them to use the DLC's new powers. It'll even act as a difficulty modifier to ensure players aren't overpowered despite their level. That said, returning characters won't be as strong in the newer areas. So, they'll need to upgrade themselves using Scadutree Blessings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to all these changes, the Shadow Of The Erdtree will see you take on 10 new bosses. Similar to the base game, not all boss fights are required for you to finish the story. But as of the time of this writing, it's unclear which bosses players will be able to skip.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadow Of The Erdtree is scheduled to drop later this month on June 21.

Upgrade your trusty truck and visit a whole world of new destinations together. Discover fresh fruits and vegetables on each island of the Gustum archipelago, learn their customs, and cook meals that will make someone’s day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does one actually capture an engaging snapshot of what cooking is, and what kinds of challenges and unforeseen complications show up in this neck of the woods? Come along on our journey of designing the cooking system for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It sounds straightforward enough: Forage an apple, cut it into bite-sized chunks, and compose with some kind of intent in a bowl. If you are feeling adventurous, you might even add a sliced banana to the mix. Sprinkle a moving truck on top, and it’s bound to be a memorable experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First of all, who makes a salad with fruit? That’s as obscene as interchanging burger and sandwich.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second of all, isn’t it a little early to foreshadow in the introduction?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the menu for tonight are wildcards like:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quantum Entanglement! Compositions! Processes! … and Apple Crouton Soup?</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Prototypes">Early Prototypes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In general, our philosophy was to try to rely as much on physics as we could to provide a solid layer of interactivity with the mechanics.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Cutting">Cutting</h3><p>Dynamic Cutting, lots of pieces. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Frying">Frying</h3><p>Frying up a little piece of Apple. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the earlier stages of the game, we used the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/dynamic-mesh-cutter-208384">Dynamic Mesh Cutter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> plugin, which lets you dynamically cut up objects in runtime. We spliced that together with some basic knife skills and a bit of hand-holding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, you fry the bits and chunks in the frying pan until their “cookedness” is above a certain threshold; push your luck, and it might get burnt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You want an apple and ginger smoothie?” Let me scrap together enough chunks and bits of apple and ginger to make sure I meet the demands imposed upon me by the recipe.</span></p><p>Blend the little bits to make a lil smoothie. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stick your pile of chunks into a blender, and voila. You’ve filled a cup one-third of the way with some weird combination of liquids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Individually any of these prototypes could pass as fun interactions or mechanics. Combine them and, fast-forward, the result is a messy kitchen with the floor full of various bits and chunks of fruit, mysterious liquids, and dubious amounts of state.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How would you represent the taste of a piece of Banana in code? What if the Banana had been fried, boiled and then blended into a liquid, then combined with an apple and ginger smoothie? How many pieces of Banana do you need to contribute to the taste of the dish? How much taste is added by being fried or being burnt? It gets messy and overwhelming quite fast, and it’s so arbitrarily granular.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The old me would have been confused, eagerly plotting out the course for some thin and long pasta shapes. For the new me, it’s simply a fried banana, apple, and ginger smoothie.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the great things that derived from the ideation and prototyping phase we had on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was finding the correct level of zoom or the correct scope for the cooking simulation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feeling</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of cooking that is important, not the preciseness of the simulation. Thomas, our game director, called it “Hollywood Cooking.” Whenever I think of that phrase, my mouth curls into a grin.</span></p><p>Chili and Garlic Stir Fry. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food Processing">Food Processing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A pivotal change in approach occurred in late 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One day, Jonas and I conspired to the whiteboard, and some elements started appearing. The general process was mostly talking through the different steps food would have to take to end up in a dish that could be served and evaluated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought up a dish that would touch upon as many of the previous systems as possible—a sort of minimum viable dish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before we get into that, it’s about time we go down a level.</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Processes.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Verbs that represent the transformations the Food go through. Like Blending or Liquefying.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Appliances</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are the objects that can perform the processes, like a Blender. It requires input to be enabled (Externally, through a button, for example), but after that it can be left to its own devices.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tools</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are processes that can be triggered through Player interaction, like the Knife. It requires repeated input from the Player to perform any action. It also fetches the input directly instead of relying on external systems like an Appliance.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FoodObject</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our representation of an edible object. A food object usually consists of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Archetype</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or the template: the gold standard banana, the pink-lady standard apple.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>State</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the representation of the Food Object (the apple is sliced and fried).</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Visuals,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the visual representation of the FoodObject in its current state.</span></p><p>Ever wondered what an Apple looks like in Fruitbus? Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, lettuce take a little detour into the anatomy of an Apple.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the data structure that represents food in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which defines the archetypical version of that fruit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the apple as an example. It’s quite obvious that it Can Be Desired.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also has a distinct taste, which makes it persist through a multitude of processes, deeming it as Absorbable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And an apple is also Cuttable. Which means that when it is put to the knife, it can transform into a Sliced Apple, or a Fried Apple.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cuttable">Cuttable</h2><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Code for defining what stages a Cuttable object can go through.</span></p><p>On the left, a sliced apple. On the right, diced. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s get back to the minimum viable dish. Here is the recipe to follow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apple Crouton Soup.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Dice an apple and liquefy it. Bake bread. Cut off a slice. Dice that slice. Bake croutons. Boil the apple, and add the croutons.</span></p><p>Apple Crouton Soup, a staple in every home?! Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p>The minimum viable product of Food ProcessingTM: The Apple Crouton Soup. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The example above touches upon something that I find kind of exciting! Equipped with a handful of processes, we can now create a wide variety of dishes. And most importantly, we can talk about new dishes without having to get bogged down with too much technical jargon. We even had the opportunity to talk through a dish in front of a bouquet of Norwegian developers at Spillkonvent 2023, and it seemed that they could follow along with our excessive blabbering about processes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The work ahead of us now is polishing our selection of dishes, juicing it up, and gradually increasing the possibility space. It’s a matter of adding new processes and making the existing processes and dishes look and feel good.</span></p><p>Apple Smoothie. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s a wrap! Or maybe just a tortilla. But in reality, we’re not off the hook just yet.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Interactions and Complications">Interactions and Complications</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> touches upon almost any other gameplay mechanic in the game; funnily enough, even driving the truck has implications for cooking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Physicality is another tenet in the realm of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Everyone knows that moving vehicles combined with dynamic objects are bound to produce some funny bugs. We found out quite early on that we needed a way to simulate the interior of the Truck in a sterile environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enter Quantum Entanglement*, an idea where we separate the simulation and the visuals. All objects that enter the Truck are entangled, which actually means that we have a physical clone of the object on a flat plane somewhere, where we can do all our physics without worrying about the Truck being flipped upside down or barrelling down the side of a volcano with malicious intent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">*Has nothing to do with actual quantum physics, we just crudely borrowed the concept and it sounds cool.</span></p><p>Chop chop, then compose. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to the Quantum Entanglement, we run the composition simulations elsewhere and then apply them to the Object when things are stable. This approach is actually really cool because we just capture a specific snapshot of the simulation when things are stable and valid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Apples have, in fact, been composed neatly in the bowl in a place faraway place, where there are no external factors that can mess up the Physics interaction, and the result is then projected and applied onto the bowl in your Truck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honorable mentions</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that we don’t have the time to talk about in this round:</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Interactions with the Characters, like holding the object in their hands.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Nesting Quantum Entanglement spaces.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Physical money in blenders.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">A deeper dive into the Composition system</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something that I rediscovered while writing this article was that the current version of Food Processing would never have existed if we didn’t make the original scuffed prototypes to begin with. And I’m so thankful that we did.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the major reasons Food Processing ended up being a success for us was that we spent almost the same amount of time on pre-production and planning the rework as the time spent on the minimum viable product.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something else that really worked out in our favor was the trust we got from the lead team. We had time to plan and make our ideas come to fruition. We also got challenged on our ideas, which forced us to solve more unknowns up front, which, in the end, produced a better result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Coders</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: If you have a feeling in the back of your mind that a certain mechanic or system is not performing as intended, have the confidence to challenge the status quo, make a plan, and pitch it to your decision-makers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Leads</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The next time two (or any amount for that matter)of your coders cook up an idea to refurbish one of the core mechanics of the game, as long as it’s somewhat coherent it might be worth it to give them the time to prove their ideas. Poke some holes and challenge some of the concepts that seem loose, and you might end up with a version of that mechanic that could end up being a better fit for your game.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-masterworking-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diablo-4-masterworking-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="249" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s</em> endgame upgrade system is a little convoluted at first blush. Since most casual players are butting up against The Pit and earning Masterworking materials, let’s do a quick rundown of how it all works and why you should do it.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-masterwork" data-injectable="false">How to Masterwork</h2> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">First thing’s first, you’ll need to have unlocked The Pit and completed at least one Tier 1 run-through. The quest “Pit of the Artificer” appears when you reach World Tier 4, and you can check <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Pit unlock guide </a>for more details. Once that’s done, head to the Blacksmith to use your earned Obducite to Masterwork your first piece of gear as part of the questline. </p> <p data-characters="85" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Masterworking requires materials found in the pit, which drop in the following tiers:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Rank 1-4: Obducite; drops in Pit tiers 1-30</li> <li>Rank 5-8: Ingolith; drops in Pit tiers 31-60</li> <li>Rank 9-12: Neathiron; drops in Pit tier 61+</li> </ul> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">These materials can be converted into one another at the Alchemist, with higher level materials converting into increased numbers of lower ones (1 Ingolith will convert into 3 Obducite, for examples). Use this to save time if you’re blasting high-tier Pit runs! Just don’t forget to bring along the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-runeshards-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 required Runeshards.</a></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Masterwork upgrades</h2> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">After this first Masterworking rank, that same item can be upgraded a grand total of 12 times, resulting in the following bonuses:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Each rank gives all base affixes a +5% boost</li> <li>Every fourth rank gives one random affix a +25% boost <ul> <li>This +25% boost can be applied three times to one affix, or spread out across multiple over the course of Masterworking</li> </ul> </li> <li>At Masterwork rank 12, you’ll have gained a 45% increase to all base affixes, plus an additional 75% spread across one to three affixes</li> </ul> <h2 data-injectable="false">Masterworking tips</h2> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Masterworking all your 925 item level gear that has Greater Affixes that suit your build is essential to progressing further into The Pit, but you should focus on reaching rank 4 on all pieces, then rank 8, then finally rank 12. Don’t waste time and effort trying to jack a piece up to rank 12 before anything else is upgraded! The power gains in those early ranks spread across multiple pieces of gear will far outweigh a completed one.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">Don’t forget, salvaging a Masterworked item will return all invested materials <em>except</em> those you used to get it to the current rank. So if you salvage a rank 3 item, you’ll get back 30 Obducite, but lose the 30 you used to get it to rank 3. </p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="false">You can also reset the Masterwork of an item using some materials plus a staggering 5 million gold if you’re unhappy with how the bonus affix boosts pan out, but I’d save that for your tippity-top min-maxing later on. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/why-warzone-players-should-use-the-holger-26-post-dg-58-lsw-nerf/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-warzone-players-should-use-the-holger-26-post-dg-58-lsw-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Raven Software left no stone unturned after nerfing the DG-58 LSW a second time, taking the LMG out of long-range meta contention in <em>Warzone</em>. Fortunately, the Holger 26 performs closely statistically and could take over as the new king of the battle royale. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">When <em>Modern Warfare 3’s </em>iteration of <em>Warzone </em>launched, the DG-58 LSW was a solid but unforgettable LMG that got outclassed by other class options. Everything changed in Season 3, as the new JAK Nightshade conversion kit transformed the slow and bulky LMG into a versatile AR. It didn’t take long for <em>Warzone</em> players to catch on, forcing Raven Software to respond accordingly. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mcw-jak-raven-kit-takes-over-warzone-meta-after-dg-58-lsw-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 Reloaded update</a>, the DG-58 LSW JAK Nightshade conversion kit had its damage values, max damage range, and headshot multipliers nerfed. Some players suspected this Nerf would knock the LMG out of contention, but the weapon continued to top popularity charts and get used consistently in lobbies and by pro players. </p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">So, to put down the behemoth once and for all, the DDG-58 LSW got <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-june-4-update-patch-notes-dg-58-lsw-nerf-dna-bomb-fix-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed again</a> as the weapon’s damage values suffered another substantial blow. This time, we don’t expect the LMG to still find much more use after the patch. If players aren’t sure what to use next, look no further than the Holger 26. </p> <h2 id="h-best-holger-26-loadout-in-warzone-season-4" data-injectable="false">Best Holger 26 loadout in <em>Warzone</em> Season 4</h2> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">TrueGameData shared the best possible Holger 26 loadout on <a href="https://x.com/TrueGameData/status/1798031547557396489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Holger Factory Barrel </li> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>VT-7 Spitfire Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Ascent Lord Stick </li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip </li> </ul> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">TrueGameData tested time-to-kill speeds after the DG-58 LSW nerf and concluded that the Holger 26 and Holger 556 perform better now. From zero to around 35 meters, the Holger 26 has a time-to-kill speed of just over 750 milliseconds. Meanwhile, the DG-58 LSW has the same time-to-kill speed as the Holger 26 up to around 18 meters but falls off massively after.</p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">In comparison, the Holger 556 leads all three weapons with a 714-millisecond time-to-kill speed up to around 38 meters, but the Holger 26 has a larger magazine, which makes it easier to down multiple enemies at once. The JAK Annihilator Bullpup conversion kit for the Pulemyot 762 and MTZ-762 are also great options, but the Holger 26 has every characteristic of a powerful long-range meta weapon. </p>

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It seems like every few days there’s more news about layoffs hitting video game developers, and today it’s Behaviour Interactive’s turn.&nbsp;The company announced via <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">press release</a> its plan to cut up to 95 jobs. The company’s Montreal studio will be hit particularly hard – 70 of the cut employees will be coming from there.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Up until this year, Behaviour was experiencing some incredible growth. The company’s own press release acknowledges that it’s more than doubled in size over the past years, going from 575 to 1,300 employees. “Over the same period, the greater gaming industry has also witnessed remarkable growth,” the company writes, adding, “However, the industry’s unprecedented popularity has also led to unprecedented competition.”</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">According to the press release, these changes are aimed at helping the company focus on its primary goals to “lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment.” To that end, Behaviour says that the restructuring won’t affect its work on <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, which will continue to see regular updates and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/behaviour-interactive-teases-dungeons-dragons-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/">franchise crossovers</a>.</p> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="923" data-injectable="false">At this point it seems almost unnecessary to point out that this is just the latest in a string of layoffs that’s been snaking through the industry since before the start of the year. Companies like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-announces-its-cutting-about-900-jobs-closing-london-studio/">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unity-to-lay-off-25-of-its-workforce/">Unity</a> – to name just a few – have all been hit, and the total number of jobs lost in 2024 alone is already reaching <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/around-9000-video-game-jobs-were-lost-in-2023-estimates-say/">2023’s depressing 9,000</a>. This restructuring from Behaviour may seem like small change in comparison, but every job lost is a life disrupted, and seeing all these losses piled together is staggering.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bad-boys-ride-or-die-has-a-troubling-case-of-franchise-cancer.889704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24171554/bad-boys-ride-or-die-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="sBtk4Z">Cancer is often described in layman’s terms as the body’s cells performing their function, just without any of the biological checks and balances that keep them from interfering with or overtaking one another. I’ve found it a useful metaphor for franchise cinema lately, and what can happen when it goes wrong: A film’s franchise elements metastasize and overtake a movie, trying to reinforce intellectual property at every turn, refusing to let a scene go by without some kind of callback, meta joke, or attempt to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0">make fetch happen</a>. </p>
<p id="g5rTz9"><em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em>, the fourth in the series of buddy-cop movies Michael Bay originated in 1995, seems like an unlikely victim of franchise cancer. The pleasure of a Bad Boys movie — as much as that can be discerned from a film series with a decade or more between previous entries — mostly comes from watching its two uniquely gifted comedic leads, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, engaging in antics under the direction of some of cinema’s foremost explosion-lovers. But in <em>Ride or Die</em>, the joys of Smith and Lawrence’s characters getting on each other’s nerves during improbably explosive shootouts is constantly derailed, as the script workshops or retcons every previous element from prior movies into the grand scheme of this one. </p>
<p id="vHvDim"><em>Bad Boys for Life</em>’s Belgian directing duo, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23160356/ms-marvel-directors-interview-avengercon">Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah</a> (<em>Ms. Marvel</em>) return for <em>Ride or Die</em>, which immediately follows the previous film. Detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are still trigger-happy Miami narcotics cops who play by their own rules. But they’ve got more backing these days, from AMMO support-squad members Kelly and Dorn (returning cast members Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig), and their immediate boss, Lt. Rita Secada (Paola Núñez). They also get lots of reminders to slow down. Mike, the looser of the two loose cannons, is finally settling down and getting married, while Marcus has a near-death experience that has everyone telling him to diet and chill out. Unfortunately, it just makes him think he’s invincible. </p>

<p id="WOU5eB">This time around, the partners discover a conspiracy to tarnish the reputation of their late captain, Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), who died in <em>Bad Boys for Life</em>. In their efforts to clear their former boss’s name, the two are framed as co-conspirators and must go on the run. It is perhaps the first, and most aggravating, failing of <em>Ride or Die</em> that nearly an hour of the movie’s 115-minute run time elapses before this — the central premise of the film! — actually happens. The second is all the aforementioned franchise cancer.</p>
<p id="oCLvmE"><em>Ride or Die</em> does not pass up a single opportunity to underline that this is a Bad Boys movie full of Bad Boys things. That conspiracy to frame Capt. Conrad? It’s tied to the case at the center of <em>Bad Boys II</em>. A vital clue for who’s behind it comes from Fletcher (John Salley), who you likely won’t recognize unless you’ve recently seen the first two films. “Bad Boys,” the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd68AthoNIw">1987 Inner Circle hit</a> made famous by the TV show <em>Cops</em> and adopted as the movie franchise’s theme song? You’ll hear no less than three versions of it. What’s more, Mike and Marcus sing it <em>twice</em>, and people constantly call them “the Bad Boys” as if they are the X-Men. </p>
<p id="5ol9ez">All of which makes <em>Ride or Die</em> feel like a less successful version of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/4/3/8325549/fast-and-furious-timeline"><em>Fast Five</em></a>. That film took what was at the time a series of four tonally distinct, loosely connected <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23720463/fast-furious-watch-order-movies-timeline-streaming">Fast &amp; Furious films</a> and willed them into a coherent franchise with some timeline shenanigans and heaps of charisma. The Bad Boys movies, however, do not have as much raw material to fashion into a modern engine of perpetual cinema. They have Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and one very good callback involving Marcus’ son-in-law, Reggie (Dennis Greene). That’s about it. </p>

<p id="gTiBy4">Most of the fault can arguably be laid at the feet of Chris Bremner and Will Beall’s script, which is poorly paced and chock-full of clichés. (It’s kind of hard to keep your composure when Joe Pantoliano, in a pitch-perfect imitation of Princess Leia Organa, leaves the Bad Boys a recorded message calling them “my only hope.”) Smith and Lawrence gamely deliver some pretty terrible jokes, and the supporting cast that returns from <em>Bad Boys for Life</em> is sturdy enough for government work, even while working with such uninspired material. </p>
<p id="QENysQ">El Arbi and Fallah’s direction is the brightest aspect of <em>Ride or Die</em>. The pair has leveled up since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/15/21067187/bad-boys-for-life-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence"><em>Bad Boys for Life</em></a>, showing themselves as eager students of Bayhem, happy to deploy camera work as exciting as the shootouts it captures. Frenetic drone shots zoom through gunfire, cameras pivot over the barrel of a gun, and nothing ever, ever stays still. It’s a bit overwhelming: Restrained compared to Bay in their previous effort, they overreach a bit here. Their action shines brightest when it features someone capable of believably kicking ass on screen, like Jacob Scipio, returning as Mike Lowrey’s long-lost son from <em>Bad Boys for Life</em>.</p>
<p id="ytC4MO">However, the over-the-top shenanigans are all in the service of retrofitting a sprawling franchise over a handful of movies that were never really about strong narrative ties. This is all the more frustrating given the few moments that <em>do</em> get what the Bad Boys movies are about. Like, for example, the third-act shootout where Mike is at his lowest, and it’s on Marcus to motivate him — by shouting the lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd5gFx001qg">Run-DMC’s “Peter Piper”</a> at him. </p>
<p id="1jxBRC">This is the Bad Boys franchise operating as it should. It doesn’t need constant callbacks building out an elaborate mythology. It just needs two charismatic guys dishing out jokes of varying quality. It needs an irresponsible amount of gunfire. And it needs hell-yeah moments like this one, where Martin Lawrence yells that he needs a “big bad wolf in the neighborhood,” and the audience can yell “Not bad meaning BAD, but bad meaning GOOD” right back. </p>

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC is an excellent challenge to complete for any <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team fan, as it guarantees a special card. </p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Moreover, the pool of cards only includes the very best items, as all of those with a rating of 90 or lower have been discarded. Moreover, the SBC also offers a pick, so you can choose one from multiple options (allowing you better chances at packing one of the more valuable items). </p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-91-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">Since the potential to pack something is pretty high, EA Sports has included two tasks. The conditions of both the tasks are different, and the second one is more challenging. </p>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – 85-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min.

Team Rating: 87</li> </ul> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">You’ll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and I would recommend to go for the latter unless there’s a dupe TOTS item in stock. </p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-91-tots-player-pick-sbc-cheapest-solutions" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC cheapest solutions</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">If you opt for the cheapest solution, it will save in-game resources for other SBCs like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-thiago-silva-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Thiago Silva End of an Era</a>.</p> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – 85-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"> <li>Dani Parejo 86</li> <li>Cristiana Girelli 86</li> <li>Bella Bixby 84</li> <li>Nacho Fernandez 83</li> <li>Merle Frohms 85</li> <li>Koke 84</li> <li>Dabritz 84</li> <li>Alex Grimaldo 84</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Wilfried Zaha TOTW 86</li> <li>Romelu Lukaku 84</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 2 – 87-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"> <li>Fabinho 84</li> <li>Wendie Renard 88</li> <li>Bernardo Silva 88</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Bruno Fernandes 88</li> <li>Christina Endler 88</li> <li>Alexandra Popp 88</li> <li>Stanislav Lobotka 84</li> <li>Lena Oberdorf 87</li> <li>Martin Odegaard 87</li> <li>Laura Freigang 83</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">Once again, the value of completing the 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC completely depends on luck. While the 91+ rating includes the best possible TOTS items, it also includes many cheap fodder-grade cards. Moreover, this SBC can also offer the older TOTS team items which were released earlier in <em>EA FC 24</em>. </p> <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="false">This challenge is worth trying for those who have lot of duplicate fodder and want to gamble at getting one from the best TOTS players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splodey-review-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splodey-review-a-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum.889683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splodey-review-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Platformers are where many gamers got their start - <em>Mario, Crash Bandicoot, LittleBigPlanet, Lucky </em>- the list goes on. Graduating from that to the precision platformers like <em>Super Meat Boy</em> is the next step. <em>Splodey </em>from Send It Studios takes this a step further by creating a precision platformer with no jump button.</p>

<p>In <em>Splodey </em>the player takes on the role of a wizard with exploding potions. Traversing around normally the wizard has a pretty slow movement, and as I stated above, they can't jump. How the wizard gets around this though is by using their exploding potions to propel them.</p>

<p>Starting in a hub space the first challenge you'll face is trying to reach the first batch of levels…</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-level-select.jpg?itok=zZ8LzAqD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-level-select.jpg?itok=AeUdmQf1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once you unlock further worlds it's a platforming challenge to even reach them</figcaption></figure><h2>Reverse Momentum Pixel Platforming</h2>

<p>When I first heard of this game I was very interested in the idea of a "platformer without a jump button", after seeing some gameplay I thought it might play a bit like <em>No Time To Explain</em> but it is so much harder.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>No Time To Explain</em>, where at any point you can alter the trajectory of the gun that is pushing the player character the momentum of the wizard in <em>Splodey </em>is wholly dependent on the trajectory of your initial explosion.</p>

<p>If you want to fly high then you'll need to aim directly down, if you want to cross a great distance then you need to fire a potion at a very flat angle, or be against a wall. Once in the air firing another potion will do nothing to affect your flight path.</p>



<p>This is a tough movement style to learn, controller is definitely recommended, but as you are forced to chain jumps, and added momentum there are so many satisfying levels that you'll complete and watch the replay in awe of your own prowess.</p>

<h2>Beat Levels, Unlock Worlds, Obtain New Challenges</h2>

<p>The core gameplay is completing each individual level by reaching the portal at the end. In the beginning, the hurdles you face are just ledges and pits, forcing you to precisely make your way over or past them, but as you continue between the different worlds different obstacles will begin to appear.</p>

<p>Just when you start to feel you've gotten the hang of spikes a new world will introduce repeating turrets firing out arrows, or blocks that you can only stand on for a certain amount of time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-falling-level.jpg?itok=Z7v6XDf8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-falling-level.jpg?itok=S9oX0F_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some levels have you attempting to reach floors past what you can normally see</figcaption></figure><p>Playing this game was a constant uphill struggle, just when I felt I had started to understand a mechanic or had gotten good at precisely throwing a potion while parachuting so I didn't hit spikes the game would immediately put me in my place.</p>

<p>Lengths of levels were something that did begin to get on my nerves. As each level is so bite-sized it's understandable you could get through them in seconds before moving on. I found a lot of the levels would have a gimmick or plan to it but then would add one more step or two to the end that would make things especially frustrating.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of this is a room with low ceilings and arrows that you need to get through with short hops. To get through one corridor would be easy, two or three a bit more of a pain, but having to get through five corridors like this felt like a bit much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-momentum-level.jpg?itok=R_oQ8VJf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-momentum-level.jpg?itok=s0Ey-rtE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maintain momentum and make precise jumps through portals to launch yourself through portals</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, those levels where the gimmick requires just that bit more perfection will be the ones that gamers looking for a difficult platformer will really eat up.</p>

<h2>Extra Challenge On Top Of Your Challenge</h2>

<p>While playing there are also Souls in the shapes of flying skulls for you to collect (normally in hard-to-reach places), gold coins that can be earned by completing levels in a certain time frame, and hidden bonus levels that turn the challenge up to eleven.</p>

<p>The two collectibles contribute to new character skins and potion colors respectively but don't alter gameplay, those challenge levels are not for the faint of heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-soul-level.jpg?itok=MfQjEIb2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-soul-level.jpg?itok=XD3VHA00 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Souls will have you put yourself in danger, or even force you to backtrack through the level to claim</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Splodey </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm a fan of a lot of precision platformers, like <em>Super Meat Boy </em>or <em>Celeste</em>, but the core mechanic of directed explosions to jump was a lot to wrap my head around. <em>Splodey </em>does a great job of taking something we have seen before but to a whole new level and if you're a fan of tough platformers this is one you should be looking into.</p>

<p>While the levels themselves are challenging, and sometimes a bit too long, done successfully it's a fast process. This lends the game to a pick-up-and-put-down kind of gameplay style, which is great for when you get a bit too fed up with a game and need to put it down for a bit.</p>

                <p>
                            Splodey does a good job of creating a unique twist on the Precision Platformer genre and, while I do think smaller individual challenges would be better, those who are into the genre will likely enjoy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24171548/7th-citadel-kickstarter-solo-cooperative-adventure-release-date-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="LHOB9E">Given the nature of the work that I do here as Polygon’s tabletop editor, I end up playing an awful lot of board games by myself. Not board games that you <em>should</em> play by yourself, mind you. Instead of luxuriating with the cardboard equivalent of the Times’ Sunday crossword, I look more like <a href="https://youtu.be/SdGlrC0oL_A">Bugs Bunny playing baseball</a>. That’s why I’m excited to get my hands on <em>The 7th Citadel</em>, among the best modern solo board games. It’s also pretty great as a cooperative experience.</p>
<p id="xjYlmI">Published by <a href="https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/us/">Serious Poulp</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero"><em>The 7th Citadel</em></a> is the descendant of <a href="https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/us/games-in-english/78-core-box-english-3760212172618.html"><em>The 7th Continent</em></a>, a Cthulhu-inspired board game that made waves back in 2015 with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-explore-survive-you-are-the-hero">a €1.2 million campaign</a>. That one I’ve played quite a lot, and I admire its depth and complexity. Players take on the role of explorers who must use their survival skills to prevail against otherworldly odds. But the game itself is just a big box of numbered cards. The system, inspired by <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> books<em>, </em>uses those numbered cards — nearly 850 of them in the base game — to tell an elaborate story. Then, at the end of the adventure, you end up with a table covered in a charming isometric map made from the cards you’ve drawn.</p>
<p id="I9Lrus">Not only does the game work exceedingly well as a solo experience, I’ve also played it more or less hot-seat with other members of my family. While I have the attention level to see it through to the end, I’ll often be joined at several points along the way by other explorers. It’s a delight. </p>
<p id="rgvDP5">Meanwhile, Serious Poulp kept on publishing. It blew the doors of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-what-goes-up-must-come-down">its next campaign in 2018</a>, which included a reprint and a big expansion. All told, it earned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/2/16842204/tabletop-games-are-exploding-on-kickstarter-video-games-are-flat">over $7 million dollars</a>. That effort was later followed up, in 2020, with <em>The 7th Citadel</em>, a dark medieval-inspired tale with nearly identical mechanics. That one pulled in more than €3.2 million.</p>

<p id="VDahu8">Now the design team of Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter are back for another reprint. This one includes <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero">a lavish new version of <em>The 7th Citadel</em></a><em> </em>and, like the reprint campaign for <em>The 7th Continent</em> from 2018, also includes a hefty expansion, as well as the promise of more stretch goals as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p id="hG68bl">Here’s a bit from the press release about how it differs from its forebears:</p>
<blockquote><p id="tskAOX"><em>The 7th Citadel</em> differentiates itself from its predecessor by bringing lots of new elements to the table. First of all, it has its own original universe to explore: <em>The 7th Citadel</em>’s story takes place in a post-apocalyptic medieval world called “The Collapsing Lands”. Players will step into a dark world filled with mysterious Necrodruids, monstrous plants, and the even more dangerous Burrowers, in a fight for survival spanning multiple adventures called Threats. In terms of mechanics, <em>The 7th Citadel</em> offers exciting new additions such as an evolving world map, customizable Action decks, the possibility for players to develop their own Citadel between scenarios, and much more.</p></blockquote>
<p id="CnbrTA">While I may not pony up for the campaign myself, it’s certainly on my radar once it hits retail. But if you’d like to get yours sooner, move fast. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero/description">The campaign</a> only runs from today until June 19. Copies start at about $54, with delivery expected by Nov. 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/a-fists-on-feet-first-look-at-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-best-prices-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blasting monsters in the chops with a Bruce Lee backfist—few things feel more badass than that. So, when FromSoftware said my “hands on” could be literally just that—using my mitts to <em>kung fu the dung</em> out of every shadow under the Erdtree—I was in. The mere idea of testing out Martial Arts in Elden Ring summoned a smirk to my face; three-hours of punch-a-riffic playtime later, it was a toothless ear-to-ear grin.</p><p>Ever since the Monk class in Diablo III—or the time I found the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/demons-souls/Hands_of_God">Hands of God</a> in Demon’s Souls—I've been a big fan of the biff. Particularly in PvP. There’s something hugely satisfying about facing an armed foe thirsty for blood, but you serve them a tall glass of “wa-taaa” instead.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that I also decided to make my own Way of the Fist through Shadow of the Erdtree harder still by ignoring the helpful new damage buff system. The only 'leg up' I want to use is a heavy sidekick to Spartan Boot baddies off a cliff.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The only 'leg up' I want to use is a heavy sidekick to Spartan Boot baddies off a cliff.</p></div><p>For those of you who are curious, however, Shadow of the Erdtree has Scadurtree Fragments that can be redeemed at a Site of Grace to decrease the amount of damage enemies deal to you in this DLC. Alternatively, there are Revered Spirit Ash blessings, which will instead increase the amount of damage dealt by your spirit summons.</p><p id="2">To hear more about how my particular brand of self-imposed masochism went, click <a href="#2">here</a> to continue. For now, though, I should provide some price options for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for you “mind’s already made up” types.</p><h2>Best Prices for Shadow of the Erdtree</h2><div id="201626"><p><h3>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Ed.</h3></p></div><h2>Shadow of the Erdtree Hands On</h2><p>We are so back. These are the four words that invade my brain as I step into my 3-hour Shadow of the Erdtree demo. The fact that those four words will soon change to four others—oh God, please help—is something we’ll get to later. For now, though, let me make the opening majesty of this DLC live for you a little.</p><p id="2">And I say a little, because I only really want to describe the barest tip of a massive iceberg that’s roughly the size of Limgrave. If you’re a fellow quadruple-digit-hours veteran, you already know that half the joy of Elden Ring is in its discovery, surprise, and deaths due to overconfidence. Shadow is still rooted in these things, so I’ll try to stick to the main trunk of my experiences. You know—not branch off. Treemendous puns aside, I truly believe many other undiscovered fruits and thorns await you in your own playthrough.</p><p>I’m taking the same approach to giving you a plotline beyond a basic overview. Though, to be fair, practically anything I mention here wouldn’t spoil much for 95% of you. Elden Ring is famously obtuse and evasive with its storytelling—that's back again. But this is just how we like it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/eldenring-sote-screenshot-9-1717529185250.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Pain By Numbers</strong></h2><p>What I’ll do first is hand you some numbers. You see, this demo had to take place on FromSoftware’s home turf, so my 1,200 hour character, Fierce Brosnan, could not be brought to bear.</p><div><p>The obvious downside to that: I was a fish out of water with unfamiliar traits, no Mithril-level long johns nor any of my Excalibur class weaponry. Clearly, the idea was to push me into trying out some of the 100 new weapons that will be in SotE. To save time, I’m outfitted with a handful of them. The ones I mention here will have to be acquired from a spot somewhere in the guts of this DLC.</p><p>There’s also an upside to being issued a pre-made Tarnished: The typically aloof FromSoftware was forced to show me its hand a little here. There’s been much evasion as to what level one ought to be at in order to enter these deadly DLC straits. In order to keep media and content creators reasonably effective within our three hour window, my demoers had to pick a number.</p></div><p>How tall do you need to be for this ride? The level numbers “120 to 200” are thrown about in my pre-demo pep talk, but in the end I’m offered a choice of three level 150 avatars. I ignore the Warrior and Sorcerer options to go with their Knight / Dex build (HP: 1939, FP: 110, Stam: 133, Poi: 42). Attributes (Vig: 51, Min: 18, End: 25, Str: 22, Dex: 80, Int: 11, Fai: 12, Arc: 10).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Waiting in the equipment is my new Martial Arts, called the Keen Dryleaf Arts.</p></div><p>All in all, my Knight seems like a pretty usable build, which my demoer insists will be “good enough” to be effective. That being said, you newcomers ought to be aware that From's DLC tends to be significantly more difficult than the base games, so I’d grind higher than 150.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that I’m decked from head to toe in Oathseeker plate armour. Secondary equipment-wise, I have access to Finger Creeper Ashes +16 (think: a shetland-pony-sized Addams Family hand), Gravebird Ashes +10, and a Black Knight Commander Andreas +10 summon.</p><p>I also have two swords and a shield that I’ll detail later on, because the challenge here is to rely almost entirely upon my fists and feet of fury. Additionally, waiting in the equipment is my new Martial Arts, called the Keen Dryleaf Arts +25 (Attk: 178+, 231) and it’s running an Ash of War named Whirlwind.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/eldenring-sote-screenshot-6-1717529251076.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Leaving the Lands Between</strong></h2><p>Before I bid adieu to The Lands Between by touching that protruding hand at the Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace, I have a quick chinwag with a knight named Leda (who I believe was the voiceover character in the Story trailer). She says she’s been guided along an honourable path by kindly Miquella to the Land of Shadow, a place where some of her friends already are. Should I find them, they will help me; she also won’t be far behind either, so perhaps we’ll meet again.</p><p>No other dialogue is forthcoming, so I walk forward and shake hands with my fate, literally. When I do, the world goes black…</p><div><p>Allow me to explain what happens next, like an old school Text Adventure. I spawn at the Land of Shadow starting point, at what I presume to be the south western bottom of this new map. It’s dark as hell, and I’m instantly surrounded by tall shrubbery. Beyond that hedge, it seems I’m also hemmed in by large cliffs to my north and south, and there’s a huge impassable sea at my back to the west. Eastward is the only way up, so I crest a small hill through a cave to be met with an absolute moneyshot of a vista.</p><p>I’m gawking directly east over a vast open meadow that spills away for ages until it eventually hits a large cliffside that’s garnished with a patchy pine tree forest. Beyond those nodding trees, the world tapers off into a thick mist that spans an indeterminate distance between what I can see and this distant, dominating Erdtree. It seems to be a younger or sickly sprout whose roots are half bonded to the top of some indiscernible structure.</p></div><p>Though I’m on the clock, I can’t help but stand here for a few minutes, watching as the wind tussles the prairie, flicks leaves past, and eventually pushes in a light drizzle of rain across this living lake of grassland. The whole scene reeks of opportunity, danger, and time wasting secondary-path locales.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The whole scene reeks of opportunity, danger, and time wasting secondary-path locales.</p></div><div><p>In the middle-distance to the south-east (and the edge of my demo playspace) are scant signs of ruined civilization—a highway gatehouse perhaps. On the horizon to my extreme north east, the imposing mountain fortress of Castle Ensis rises up out of the gloom, too.</p><p>In the yawning distance between me and that goal is a light sprinkling of ruined architecture, randomly jutting out of this vast field. Curiously, one of the most distant of these structures appears to be both on fire and…moving. More on that horror in a minute.</p></div><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/03/eldenring-shadow-fp-blogroll-1717445459923.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Venturing into Shadow</strong></h2><p>In my immediate vicinity, there are dozens of ghostly gold gravestones. Creepily, they sort of wink out of existence as I pass through them. Unwilling to add myself to their number, or become exposed to attack in that open field to God knows what, I turn to put the cliffside to my left, and I hug it in a north-to-north-easterly heading.</p><div><p>Pretty soon, I begin to sashay through a handful of small stonework archways. Some have avian-esque gargoyles atop them. A quick R3 click reveals what I already know, and as if by invitation, these non-concrete condors start to swoop in.</p><p>When Big Bird lands, I feed him a full six piece and soda with a four hit punch combo that instantly feels gratifying, damaging, and (unlike regular unarmed in Elden Ring) viable. You see, one can already play the base game with no weapons, technically, but that’s like saying you can steer a car with your feet. You could do it, but it’s not to be <em>done</em>—unarmed base damage was abysmal, and the scaling virtually non-existent.</p></div><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I ground them with the sort of Tatsumaki Senpukyaku that'd get a thumbs up from Ken.</p></div><p>Martial Arts in Shadow of the Erdtree is a different beast altogether. Damage is comparable to a perfectly good sword, repeated strikes propel me forward a nice distance, and my kicks and punches pierce through ranks to hit enemies crowding behind their mates. More importantly, it’s just…fun and flashy to do.</p><p>Better yet, when these buzzards try to thwart my range by hovering in the air, I tap L2 for a Whirlwind kick. I ground them with the sort of Tatsumaki Senpukyaku that'd get a thumbs up from Ken Masters. It’s at this point that I fall head over heels <em>with my own heels</em>. Literally kicking arse with Martial Arts is all I wanna do for three hours now.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/eldenring-sote-screenshot-3-1717529401787.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>A Grave Situation</strong></h2><p>With a new sense of cockiness, I continue north. The mini-archways with easy-to-spot raptors give way to an actual cemetery featuring gnarled trees that perfectly camouflage my feathered friends. In my haste to escape their swoops, I accidentally dive-roll down into The Western Nameless Mausoleum via a short staircase. At the base of it <em>[minor spoiler here]</em> is a boss mist barrier to a Blackgaol Knight whose opening gambit is a crossbow that pings 9 bolts in about 3 seconds. That’s all I’ll say about him.</p><div><p>Returning back up to the same surface entrance a short while later, I consider poking around the cemetery until I spot half a dozen of these weird pool noodle things poking out of the ground. Glowing in an eerie bioluminescent blue, they’re about seven foot tall, and they are peaceful…until I charge up a flying kick into one. Instantly, all twelve become a pissed off hive mind. I have to book it when they all sprout angry pink heads and then try to whack-a-mole me into my own grave.</p><p>I bail eastward into the open field again, whereupon I hit the Three-Path Crossroads and some choices open up. To the south, there’s that dilapidated gatehouse, adjoined by yet another cemetery. A quick poke down there reveals some lethargic shadow folk whose hobbies include silent prayer to the Erdtree or casting swift moving, near-endlessly-homing skull magic at me. Further south than that unwelcoming committee is a Map Fragment you’ll really want to get.</p></div><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They are peaceful…until I charge up a flying kick into one.</p></div><p>Alternatively, going east from the Three-Path crossroads yields a bit more grassland, weird stone spiral columns, more mini mausoleums, and roving packs of candelabra + sword wielding tree goons. Pruning my way through them reveals the first of the 100 new weapons in this DLC. It’s something my demoers have already added to my build, wicked dual scimitars that are held “ninja reverse-style.” The one I own is a Keen Backhand Blade +25 (220+, 367).</p><p>Any progression eastward is thwarted by a large canyon that scars this land from north to south—a non-water-based moat that may only be crossed via a highway-sized bridge to my north. Curiously, when I squint across this abyss, I get a free ticket to an endlessly repeating show.</p><div><p>It’s tough to discern who’s who from the bleachers, but it seems a fellow knight is trading culture with a trio of 8-foot-tall trolls. At least one of these beasts desperately wants this human to join his club. Literally. Big wooden one.</p><p>Distracted by a dozen other things to do and see, I forget to make my way down to reach them, and am left wondering if they’re one of Leda’s pals. Feels likely.</p></div><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/eldenring-sote-screenshot-4-1717529467176.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Shadow of the Erdcolossus</strong></h2><p>Shrugging, I turn northwest to an even more awe-inspiring sight. One of those fire giant things from the trailers dominates the prairie between myself and the castle’s bridge. Burnie Boy is basically a wicker Shadow of the Colossus understudy with a lit brazier for a head and chest. Technically, he does have an actual face. Three of them, in fact. Mask-like objects adorn his abdomen and each upper thigh. Freaky stuff.</p><p>While watching in intimidated silence, I note that this lumbering monstrosity is tracing a slow circular patrol across this meadow. However, on the edge of his commute stands hope in the form of a reasonably-sized chunk of stonework. The message that pops into my head: “Visions of Cover Cheese, Try Peck and Roll.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fireman Spam has become my new nemesis, and I can’t wait to make him snuff it.</p></div><p>I sprint to the perceived safety of that little brick oasis while giving my target a wide berth, only to be horrified as I’m spotted from an incredible distance away. Hobo Stove On Legs then kicks the ground in front of him to send an arcing wave of car-sized lava boulders at me. It’s an overkill amount of projectiles. By some small miracle, I thread through with a dive-roll before reaching cover.</p><p>What happens next, during my brilliant plan to nip at his cankles while he wallhumps the stone column between us? Chaos. Whenever I round my cover to strike, he raises that hoof and delivers a stomp with AoE flames. Upon learning that this attack can flare “through” my cover, I horse up and gallop the hell out of Dodge to the north.</p><p>The fact that I’m nearly unhorsed by a farewell lava ball assault as I’m tearing away at top speed, tells me a mounted assault on that dude might be suicide, too. Needless to say, Fireman Spam has become my new nemesis, and I can’t wait to make him snuff it. Preferably with kung fu.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/3-1717529574284.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Bridge to Terrorbiffya</strong></h2><p>The elevating field northward becomes progressively rockier and foggier—akin to a Scottish Highland. When I crest this hill, I’m at yet another crossroads. Further northwards dips down into a huge open valley pocked with more ghostly gravestones, I can’t see where it ends because the land gets eaten by a Stephen King level of horror-hiding mist.</p><p>I’m not permitted to venture down there. And, frankly, I don’t even want to go.</p><p>Directly to my west stands a Moria-esque archway carved into the cliffside, beyond it lies the Belurat Castle Settlement (whose labyrinthine streets snake higher up to the House of the Dancing Lion). Dismounting, I run due east to the aforementioned overpass. The game christens it the Ellac Greatbridge. But I just think it’s ok.</p><p>That’s mostly because it’s littered with debris, rows of chevaux de frise, and a guard of half a dozen zombie vikings. Worse, a giant ballista that fires accurate, arcing explosive rounds every 8 seconds has a long and commanding overwatch on me. See what I mean? Averagebridge, at best.</p><p>Sadly, my heroic plan to serpentine charge through said artillery, kill the shooter, and then use his weapon against the bridge mobs fails (you can’t use it). So, I lure these norsemen, one by one, into the nearby soldier encampment beyond. Just as I force-feed a knuckle sandwich into the last of them and the intensity of this tent city lessens, the true owners of these bivouacs pounce.</p><p>Chief among these unhappy campers is a knight chieftain, wielding a shield the size of a large metal door and what looks to be an engine block on a stick. Adopting a When In Rome approach, I strap my left arm with a Messmer Soldier Shield +25 (196+, 43) to better absorb his hits and answer with either a heavy sidekick or a jumping superman punch to his grille.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Uppercut, elbow, roundhouse, sidekick, backfist, back-kick—I ding that tinman until he’s crushed for recycling.</p></div><p>When he’s stunned, I clobber him with my full R1 six-hit combo. I’m talking uppercut, elbow, roundhouse, sidekick, backfist, back-kick—I ding that tinma<strong>n </strong>until he’s crushed for recycling.</p><p>A little further to the east, beyond a much-needed Site of Grace, I encounter a mid-boss who receives a different style of pasting. Being a 15-foot heavy-hitter with a penchant for slow stomps and vertical sword strikes, I opt to deliver faster hits in a longer combo, a technique facilitated by “two-handing” my Martial Arts with Triangle + R1.</p><p>I’m even more delighted with the new strikes in this 11-hitter. We’re talking double-tapper roundhouse kicks and a finisher that’s this powerful two-handed clapfist to the ears of your opponent. Or, in this case, either side of old mate’s shinbone.</p><p>Despite being level 150 still, I’m reasonably effective in this fight, though I do fall victim to the second irritation of my demo experience (the first being a brief moment of mass object pop as riding across the grasslands). While cheesing this mid-boss around the corner of a large cathedral, I fall victim to him vertically chopping me through the building by a wide margin with a sword that could be God’s own letter-opener. It’s a legacy issue in Soulsbornes that should have been made extinct by now, but I adjust for it and make him pay with his life.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/eldenring-sote-screenshot-8-1717529628186.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>The Dismount</strong></h2><p>A short distance beyond this menace, the staircase and ladder-filled cathedral district thickens in complexity. In short, Shadow of the Erdtree finally starts to do what I love best about this series—that spaghetti-wind level design that offers up boltholds, ambush points, and loot-hiding cul de sacs. In the case of the latter, a nearby one hides a meme-tastic sword, the Keen Milady +25 (263+, 320).</p><p>After a few satisfying test swings, I tip a phantom fedora to it, and stubbornly stick with my fists for the remaining 2 hours of demo time. In fact, I basically decide then and there to do my full launch day run like this, purely because I’m so utterly enamoured with haymaking horrors, unleashing running flying kicks into faces, or simply Crit Attacking fools with brutal kidney-strikes.</p><p>And it’s at this point, I’ve just realised that I’ve gushed for far too long about a very, very small, fraction of my time with Shadow of the Erdtree. I’m going to hit pause on my tale for today. Hopefully, an opportunity will arise for me to regale you with the remaining 2/3rds of the demo, where I effectively turn back, cross over Ellac Okaybridge, and head westward to a major objective.</p><div><p>For it’s on that heading that lies the castle domain of Shadow of the Erdtree’s first full-cutscene boss. I can say that he will be a major migraine for all but the best of you, but one you’d be absolutely nuts to miss out on. Alternatively, here's the account of one of my US contemporaries who scooped up an axe and made a beeline to that other castle.</p><p>Because after the full three hours my instincts were telling me nothing but good things about the remainder of this DLC. There is little doubt in my mind. The pieces seem very much in place for Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree to become one of the most essential bits of extra content I’ve played since the venerable Bloodborne: The Old Hunters.</p></div><p>And as you veteran Tarnished should already know, my Soulsborne compliments don’t get much higher than that.</p> Adam Mathew is our Aussie deals wrangler.
