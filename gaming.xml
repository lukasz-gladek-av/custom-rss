<p>TPC's latest takes the top two spots this week, with the Switch 1 version putting up 872,552 sales and the Switch 2 hitting 612,905. Combined, this puts Z-A just shy of 1.5 <em>million</em> sales in its first week. It's far from the 2.5 million achieved by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>'s debut, though it's a little higher than the 1.42 million achieved by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a>.

It's also the location of skip drive manufacturing, allowing Earth Directorate ships to travel across all systems. Of course, there's an issue that brings you here, aside from toppling the regime of the Sovereign, which is to learn why skip drives are creating dangerous space rifts. Promising a more polished experience and defined story,&nbsp;see if it hits the mark in our&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d44108b-4675-49c2-9b33-fb5caaa62a59" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review" rel="nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a>&nbsp;</em>review.</p>

<h2>Choices Matter in a Colorful World</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wdqu51no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=2PkkWtal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The main story is relatively straightforward, with some minor plot twists added in. You have six Companions you can recruit, starting right off the bat with two of them. You can go solo, with a single partner, or bring a max of two people with you when you leave your ship, the Incognito.</p>

<p>There are a variety of areas to explore, but many can feel too hard too quickly if you just follow the main quests. Upgrading your weapons and armor, as well as completing companion quests, are requirements for moving forward without struggling. While this is the case for many RPGs, it feels like side quests are more necessary than optional.</p>

<p>Speaking of side quests, they are the real star of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. I don't mean the Companion quests, which can often be resolved with little to no combat. Side quests have you hunting for Manticore pupa, taking out scavengers, finding magazine issues, or finding patent schematics. These involve combat, use a variety of skills, can bring you to new places, or offer a trophy for the Incognito.</p>

<p>While most of the main quests use the same skills or traits, these other missions give you more opportunities to explore what makes your Commander unique, hone in on your individual playstyle, and potentially earn some sweet perks.&nbsp;While all the writing is passable, the side quests are where the different, and often wacky, personalities shine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;is how your actions, or lack of actions, impact the game. This can be seen quickly, as well as in the long term. Some decisions can cause you to lose companions, be attacked on sight by a whole faction, or destroy a location. These change the general feeling of the game, while the main narrative stays the same. Your interactions with companions and NPCs can take on a completely different tone and direction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=Pa5ve57O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=ciPdEeh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Large choices obviously have larger consequences, but small actions also have an effect. As you progress through the game, you'll start racking up Flaws. Crouch often? You may have a Flaw discovered that your knees start to crack, reducing your stealth. If you steal frequently, you may end up as a Kleptomaniac, causing you to steal regardless of your current surroundings when you hover over an item. You don't have to accept a Flaw, but they can open new avenues for you to experience the title.</p>

<h2>More of the Same</h2>

<p>Even though there are a number of Flaws that can influence your playthroughs,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;story focuses on the utilization of very few traits, skills, or perks. When it comes to impact, many of the perks you can select, and about half of the skills, don't seem to really affect the overall gameplay. All you need is Lockpicking, Brawny, Hack, Science, and Leadership (or Speech) to make it through the storyline quickly and easily. By the time that I reached the endgame, it was apparent that you should focus on three or four Skills and ignore the rest to reach the high-level requirements seen in the final missions.</p>

<p>The main way the majority of Traits and Skills are seen is through different dialogue options. Outside of that, interacting with the world, completing quests, or finding unique items, mainly require the same things over and over again. Even talking to people with specialized dialogue can become repetitive.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=NcufFWYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=EqIqU-hx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repetition isn't necessarily bad, especially when dealing with the strict dogma ingrained in the three factions found in <i>The Outer Worlds 2</i>. Getting the extent of brainwashing or cultural control across is one of the themes present. It gets to the point, however, that the game becomes uninteresting. It doesn't necessarily reach the level of boring, but there were quite a few conversations I skipped through because they sounded exactly like the one before it, or my dialogue resulted in the same conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there were a couple of bugs that impacted the game. Loot chests not disappearing off the mini map, bodies dematerializing without creating an ash or goo pile, NPCs or enemies spawning partially in the environment, and game crashes made the experience less than streamlined. Most of the bugs don't greatly impact a playthrough. Other bugs could be occurring that make playing the title difficult, including one experienced by a colleague that pretty much blocks them from using guns at any point in time.</p>

<h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2 Review</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/archivist-dialogue-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=MAzPIzrT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/archivist-dialogue-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wQGpF294 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Compared to other single-player RPG releases this year,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;just falls flat. While there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the game, there's nothing that makes it stand out against star performers like <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</em>&nbsp;There wasn't any amazing writing, the focus on different societal structures and themes felt surface-level, and repetitive interactions made the title uninteresting. There was no hook that kept me wanting to play beyond reaching the end of the main story in the hopes that something amazing would wow me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow">The Outer Worlds</a>,&nbsp;</em>the sequel is more of the same. Newcomers to the franchise can find humor laced throughout the game, unique weapons, and a mostly bug-free experience. Those looking for exquisite writing with a fresh take on RPG mechanics will not find great pleasure in&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have come to the conclusion that it was a mistake to play the demo for cyber <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> Oneway.exe on my lunch break. I'm not going to tell you what I had for lunch - I think if I describe it in full, I will throw up. But I will say that it featured red peppers and purple onions, and I now wish never to see those colours ever again. 
</p>
<p>Also, it's possible that I'm <em>still</em> playing the demo for Oneway.exe, because the game takes place inside an off-brand mock-up of a desktop operating system. Yes, we are in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everything-is-going-to-be-ok">Everything Is Going To Be OK</a> territory. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>-ville. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>, er, land. But you never saw quite such... sights in either of those games, as far as I can remember. You never saw such reds and purples. You never saw such delightful little piggies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>There is only one way to tell if I have successful exited Oneway.exe's demo, and that is to drag random images from my screenshots folder into the middle of this screen, and see if they are eaten. Let's try that now. Oh thank god. 
</p>
<p>Now, let me turn around slowly, just in case there is a hideously disfigured catgirl leering behind me. Ah phew, we're in the clear. All I can see is some guy having lunch in the house across the street. Argh, lunch. Let's not dwell upon such matters. Let's talk about the game, I guess, now that I have determined beyond reasonable doubt that I have ceased playing it.

<p>Created by Disordered Media - who wholesomely <a href="https://disorderedmedia.itch.io/">describe themselves</a> as "a husband and wife duo with a small group of friends with the shared passion of creating" - Oneway.exe is about being stuck inside another, abandoned game, Untitled.exe, and trying to work out what happened to its three developers, whose notes litter the desktop, and who are hopefully fictional.</p><p>It combines snatches of first-person exploration and puzzling with a seeping collage of impressively parodied aesthetics from across the history of the internet: gobbets of MySpace, video streams of a Minecraft-like game, discussions of "controversial indie games" on "Glitch", you get the idea. It's both a celebration of digital culture, and a putrid palimpsest of "the worst aspects of internet nostalgia", to cite a trailer blurb. It is windows upon windows upon windows, incoherent and hungry. 
</p>
<p>While firing up the game within the game, you're treated to some urban legends about a woman who had her skin peeled off. Then you're transported to a dark hallway of locked, labelled doors, plus one unlocked "Meaty" door leading to a bedroom. One wall of Meaty's bedroom is covered by what looks like a character editor from a noughties Barbie Flash game, which lets you toggle between dresses, hairdos and accessories in return for cake. The cake is used to feed a happy little mutilated piggy inside a virtual pet game on another wall.</p>
<p>A third wall carries a projection of a blog, where an unknown poster gushes in curly fonts about creativity and dressing up and did you ever think about how a blog is like a body with organs? (&gt;w&lt;) (&gt;w&lt;) The blogger boasts of having a "closet full of handmade dresses". Do not look in the closet. Lot of red and purple in there.

<p>Oneway.exe's body horror metaphors aren't exactly subtle, so far. Often, it just feels like a gleeful B-movie atrocity - squirming, cackling pulp. I doubt it has the wit, eerieness and pathos of Nathalie Lawhead's work. Still, there's a depth to its depthlessness. All the bloody, bony objects you find in Meaty's room are also flat images, invisible from the side. The New Flesh is still figuring out its own contours - there's a sense that all it can be, at the moment, is skin. But perhaps if you keep feeding it cake...
</p><p>The game's first "module" is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2349570/onewayexe_Module_10/">out now on Steam</a>, and it still has a demo as of writing. If you're interested in the demo, I strongly advise you look through the content warnings in the readme file on the game's simulated desktop, before playing Untitled.exe.</p>
<p>I also strongly advise that you consider the Steam reviews before buying, and maybe wait for the first patch - right now, there's talk of a glitch or two that blocks progress early on. As and when these technical problems are addressed, Oneway.exe has the makings of a memorable stomach-churner.

              <p>Recreations of classic maps and modes from other games are nothing new in shooters. Lately, however, publishers have started getting prickly over users remaking maps from their game in someone else’s, and it seems this may be especially true when those games are as competitive with each other as <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>Call of Duty</i>. <i>Battlefield 6 </i>players remaking <i>CoD</i> maps via the game’s new portal mode are finding this out the hard way, with their recreations of modes and maps from Activision’s popular shooter getting taken down over intellectual property violations.</p> <p>In an email to <i>Kotaku</i>, <i>Battlefield</i> player and YouTube creator Phiality saw their “<a href="https://youtu.be/7xo_Z9mr3zE">Battlefield Zombies 2028: Osiris</a>” Portal creation struck down, which notably took place after the mode gained some traction on YouTube. On October 23, 2025, EA sent them a copyright takedown notice specifically naming Activision as having filed the complaint. The notice asks them to “permanently delete the experience and create a new one that incorporates only your original work.”</p>

 <p>The use of intellectual property in user-made maps has been a thorny topic in recent years. Though some of us vets may recall the days of <i>Halo 3</i>’s user-made Forge maps that remade popular <i>CoD</i> playspaces surging in popularity without issue, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-uefn-call-of-duty-dmca-creator-copyright-1850299456">youth of today hasn’t had it as easy</a>. <i>Fortnite</i>’s publisher, Epic, has in the past policed the recreation of maps from other intellectual properties in its popular battle royale.</p>

 <p>Still, the targeting of <i>CoD</i> maps and modes in <i>Battlefield</i> feels very specific. As Phiality notes in their statement to <i>Kotaku</i>, other games, including <i>Fortnite</i>, presently have recreations of <i>CoD</i> maps. In a reverse situation, you can even download a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3587806355&amp;searchtext=BF4"><i>Battlefield 4</i> weapon pack for <i>BLOPS 3</i></a> via the Steam Workshop.</p> <p>Phiality isn’t alone in seeing their Portal creations taken down. As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-shuts-down-call-of-duty-inspired-battlefield-6-portal-maps/"><i>Insider Gaming</i></a>, a recreation of the classic <i>CoD</i> map “Shipment,” titled “Shipment first test,” got yanked with a warning that repeat copyright offenses might result in a temporary or permanent ban from not just <i>Battlefield</i>, but potentially all “EA Games &amp; Services.”</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-portal-call-of-duty-copyright-notice-2000638591]]></content:encoded>

<p>The PlayStation 5 surpassed PlayStation 3’s lifetime sales in the US in September 2025. </p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been a smash hit for Sony, with the console still accounting for a significant share of hardware sales. This is why the developers keep working on the console and its iterations, releasing slim versions and mid-gen upgrades for the consoles. Thanks to their efforts, the console has now crossed PlayStation 3’s sales record. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-playstation-5-now-sits-above-ps3-and-ps4-in-us-sales">The PlayStation 5 Now Sits Above PS3 and PS4 in US Sales</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poor-old-playstation-3-the-ps5-has-just-overtaken-its-lifetime-sales-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the new information about PlayStation 5 beating PS3 comes from a senior director at Circana, Mat Piscatella. Piscatella’s recent post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a> reveals that, based on US Video Game data through September 2025, the PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base. The analyst also revealed that PS5 has been ahead of PS4 on a time-aligned basis in the US for a very long time, and as of September, it is ahead by 4.6%. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-s-sales-performance-was-basically-flat-to-that-of-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yotei’s Sales Performance Was “Basically Flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima”</h2>



<p>Talking about sales, Mat Piscatella also shared some facts about Sony PlayStation’s latest game release, Ghost of Yotei. Piscatella revealed that with just one week in the market, “the US sales performance of Ghost of Yotei was basically flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima. It did great.” </p>



<p>The analyst added that Ghost of Tsushima launched in 2020, when the PS4’s installed base was significantly higher than the PS5’s installed base today. Additionally, there was a lot of stuff happening at the time that “significantly boosted gaming.” So, “anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye,” concluded Piscatella. </p>

Additionally, the PS3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps3-has-received-a-new-system-software-update-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a new system software update</a> earlier this year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-antiquated/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-%E2%80%9Cantiquated%E2%80%9D.1332904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The console wars are quickly becoming a thing of the past—if they’re not dead already. But Xbox’s President coming out and saying that Xbox exclusives, and the idea in general, are becoming antiquated, shows the direction the industry is moving towards.</p>



<p>Xbox’s strategies and ideologies are a shadow of what they were 20, 10, or even five years ago. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> was dominating the gaming landscape in the mid-00s to late-00s, and had a myriad of exclusive franchises at its disposal: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo</a>, Gears of War, Forza, and others. Now, almost all of these have appeared on PlayStation at some point or another, and Sarah Bond thinks this is what people want.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-biggest-games-in-the-world-are-available-everywhere">“The Biggest Games In The World Are Available Everywhere”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We still can’t get over Gears of War being on PlayStation. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, you could argue that we’ve all wanted to be able to play every game on the same console for decades, as it would save a lot of money. But business is business at the end of the day. With the gaming business, in particular, changing, Xbox President Sarah Bond’s words (via <a href="https://mashable.com/article/interview-president-xbox-sarah-bond-rog-xbox-ally-future-console-exclusives?_gl=1*63mw61*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzIwODYzMTIzLjE3NjEyMjcyNzQ.*_ga_8TEVGCYPY5*czE3NjEyMjcyNzckbzEkZzAkdDE3NjEyMjcyNzckajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>) sound as prophetic as ever:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re really seeing people evolve way past that. The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, you look at&nbsp;Minecraft, you look at&nbsp;Fortnite, you look at&nbsp;Roblox. That’s actually what’s really driving community in gaming. That’s where people gather, and they have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they’re on. And we’re really leaning into that with this experience.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is true and accurate to a certain degree. The lines between PlayStation and Xbox are as blurred as they’ve ever been. On the other hand, we can confidently predict you’ll never see Mario or Zelda anywhere near a PlayStation or Xbox console.</p>



<p>Still, there’s been a definite changing of the guard in recent years, and while Sony can still afford to release exclusives for PS5 users, it’s becoming more clear and obvious that Microsoft and Xbox’s goal posts are moving by the day.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Xbox’s President on exclusives? Is a day coming when there will be no exclusives, maybe apart from on a Nintendo device?

                <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total pay package for fiscal 2025 has been confirmed, and the executive earned a total of $96.5 million for the year.

It's a massive multiple over what the median Microsoft worker makes, with the median worker taking home around $200,000.</p><p>The executive's pay details are coming to light as the company faces scrutiny over its recent Xbox decisions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">layoffs, game cancellations, studio closures, price hikes, and increasing profit-margin mandates.</a> The company as a whole has faced ongoing criticism as well due to its slate of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-microsofts-ceo-told-employees-about-ai-and-future-of-company-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533420/" data-ref-id="1100-6533420">mass layoffs</a>, partnership with Israel, and investments in AI, among other things.</p><p>Nadella is paid a $2.5 million salary, a figure that's been the same since 2019.

Microsoft revealed all of this as part of a regulatory filing disclosed this week, as reported by <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-pay-soars-to-almost-100-million-for-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Seattle Times.</a></p><p>Nadella also makes money from an annual cash bonus--for this latest fiscal year, Nadella got paid a bonus of $9.56 million. The bonus he got last year--$5.2 million--was millions less than this year. That's because he requested a lower cash bonus for 2024 due in part to cyberattacks against Microsoft.</p><p>The median pay for a Microsoft employee, excluding Nadella's pay, rose in fiscal 2025 to $200,972, up from $193,744. At the same time, the delta between Nadella's pay and the median Microsoft salary is growing, reaching 480-to-1 for fiscal 2025--that's up from 250-to-1 in 2023.</p><p>The regulatory filing revealing Nadella's latest pay included a memo from Microsoft's board of directors saying the CEO's efforts to <a href="https://x.com/andrewrsorkin/status/1950717933774385623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">push on artificial intelligence</a> helped Microsoft's fortunes overall in the latest fiscal year. "His leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift," the board said.</p><p>Microsoft reached a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">$4 trillion market cap this year</a> and the company's stock also reached an all-time high of more than $535 earlier this year. Microsoft is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 2 most valuable company in the world right now</a>, only trailing Nvidia.</p><p>Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, taking over for Steve Ballmer. He is just the third CEO of Microsoft, following Bill Gates and Ballmer. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft's stock price has risen from about $36 in 2014 to more than $520 today, an increase of more than 1,300%.</p><p>Recently, Microsoft made headlines again over a report that said CFO Amy Hood has implemented a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">new profit-margin mandate for Xbox of 30%, which is well above industry standards.</a> Many have theorized that this reported mandate has contributed to some of the decisions Microsoft has made in recent times, including bringing its first-party games to rival platforms, raising prices on consoles and Game Pass, investing in automation technologies with AI, canceling games, closing studios, and laying off workers.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sources told Bloomberg</a> that Microsoft will look to focus on producing titles that are "cheap to make" or more likely to generate revenue as opposed to "riskier bets."</p><p>Microsoft will publish its next earnings report on October 29, at which time the company's financial fortunes for the latest quarter will be revealed.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo will let Switch 2 owners try out Kirby Air Riders in just a little over two weeks, as long as they're Switch Online subscribers. The upcoming sequel--from Kirby and Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai--will have online demo sessions during two different weekends next month: November 8-9 and 15-16.</p><p dir="ltr">Called the Kirby Air Riders: Global Test Ride, the online demo will offer the Air Ride and City Trial modes. Air Ride is traditional racing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/">"basically Mario Kart,"</a> according to Sakurai. There will be three different courses to check out: Floria Fields, Waveflow Waters, and Mount Amberfalls. Meanwhile, City Trial sees players prepping for battle in a hub area in the first phase (gathering power-ups and upgrading your vehicle) and then competing in the second phase.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders Is Faster, Deeper, and Cleaner Than The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Nintendo notes that the special demo software for Kirby Air Riders can be downloaded starting November 7. Outside of the online play test times, players can have a go at Lessons in Kirby Air Riders. So basically, practicing at the game is possible before the first play test begins on November 8.</p><p dir="ltr">Another detail highlighted for the online demo by Nintendo relates to eShop preorders for Kirby Air Riders. The company states that digital purchasers of the Switch 2 exclusive will get to wear a special hat for the Global Test Ride, but the cosmetic won't be available in the full game.</p><p dir="ltr">Sakurai presented <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-game/2900-7166/">an hourlong Nintendo Direct for Kirby Air Riders</a> earlier today. The developer stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-wont-have-dlc-sakurai-confirms/1100-6535652/">the Switch 2 exclusive won't have DLC</a>, for instance, while also introducing the Road Trip campaign and return of Top Ride. Kirby Air Riders is set to launch November 20.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kirby Air Riders: Global Test Ride times are below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Nov. 8, 12-6 AM PT / 3-9 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 8, 4-10 PM PT / 7 PM - 1 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 9, 7 AM - 1 PM PT / 10 AM - 4 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 15, 12-6 AM PT / 3-9 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 15, 4-10 PM PT / 7 PM - 1 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 16, 7 AM - 1 PM PT / 10 AM - 4 PM ET</li></ul>

<p>The plan is to automate Krafton's work around Agentic AI and fully implement AI-centered management systems. This should allow its employees to focus on creative activities and complex problems rather than, presumably, being hindered by menial tasks.</p><p>Agentic AI may sound new, but it has been around for a minute. As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">defined by IBM</a>, it's an artificial intelligence that can accomplish tasks with little to no human intervention or supervision. Think of self-driving cars, autonomous ticketing services, and cybersecurity systems. Agentic AI isn't as ubiquitous as generative AI, but the technology is more widely used than you think.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/pattrick_36/status/1981264568711045159" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Krafton has announced through the today's press release their mid-to-long term plan to turn into a "AI First" company.<br>The "AI First" strategy is set to be centered on Agentic AI - AI that sets goals and plans and works with external tools to execute complex task automation -… <a href="https://t.co/6Q7ejGQehu" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Q7ejGQehu</a></p>  — Patryk (@pattrick_36) <a href="https://twitter.com/pattrick_36/status/1981264568711045159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>What, then, does "AI-first" mean for Kraffton? As Changhan said in the Google Translated press release, this is a strategy meant to prioritize AI as the primary means of solving problems and increasing productivity while "accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth."</p><p>In addition to pouring nearly $70 million into AI as the de facto problem-solver for every aspect of the business going forward, Krafton intends to invest 30 billion KRW (or roughly $21 million) annually starting in 2026 to support its employees' use of various AI tools for their work. While that's a future commitment, Krafton intends to fully integrate this "AI-first" strategy this year.</p><p>This hard pivot toward AI comes at a troubling time for the technology sector. A smattering of companies and developers--like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">Hideo Kojima</a>--are embracing AI, while spending on the technology is expected to hit $375 billion this year and forecasted to reach $500 billion in 2026. Some analysts believe <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the AI bubble is about the burst</a>, but none of that seems to be stopping megacorporations from opening their coffers wide.</p>

Today GDC, which is owned by Game Developer parent company Informa, unveiled the new "reimagined" conference known as "GDC Festival of Gaming," bringing with it a shift in event structure designed to "meet today's broader, interconnected games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A major component of this transformation is a simplified pass structure that offers equal access to sessions and networking events to all attendees. The new event pass starts at $649, though indies, start-ups, and academics can apply for discounts that lower the price by another $200.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this new form, the event aims to serve game makers "across every stage of a game's life cycle," and debuts with a particular focus on providing game industry professionals with new networking opportunities, redesigned conference content, improved pass pricing, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conference organizers state that these changes are "informed and inspired by feedback from the community."

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is launching the Raiju V3 Pro, a $219.99 wireless controller made for the PlayStation 5 and PC. It’s an alternative to Sony’s $199.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, which it shares many traits in common with, like adjustable trigger pull distances, swappable rear paddles, extra stick nubs, and a hard carrying case. Plus, it comes with a 2-meter-long USB-C cable that lodges snugly into its charging port to make it better suited for unpredictable tournament play.</p><p>The Raiju V3 Pro seems about as good as a third-party PS5 wireless controller can be, despite a few omissions. It lacks adaptive triggers and rumble. Also, Sony doesn’t allow Razer access to the DualSense Edge’s suite of software customization features on PS5, and it connects via a 2.4GHz USB-A dongle instead of pairing directly to the console.</p><p>However, the Raiju V3 Pro is the superior controller by one very important criterion (and a few others below, depending on taste): TMR joysticks. They are resistant to developing stick drift, and they draw less power from the battery when in use. By comparison, Sony’s high-end controller uses ALPS stick modules that are $20 each to replace when they inevitably suffer from drift after extended use. Add in the cost of two stick replacements, and the DualSense Edge costs more than Razer’s new controller.</p><p>The Raiju V3 Pro’s other design elements don’t necessarily make it a better choice over Sony’s, but they might tip the scale in Razer’s favor for you. Its bulky grips fill my hands better than the DualSense. I also like its eight-way directional pad that makes executing combos easier than with the four-way one on Sony’s gamepad. Its mecha-tactile face buttons are made from PBT, a material used in high-end keyboard keycaps, and I like the bouncy, clicky feel of the button switches. Razer’s tinker-friendly approach to its rear paddles is novel; if you don’t want to use the four rear customizable buttons, they can be swapped with a cap that almost seamlessly fills the gap.</p><p>There aren’t nearly as many high-end wireless controllers for the PS5 as there are for the Xbox, so Razer’s Raiju V3 Pro is a welcome competitor. You’ll be able to buy it… sometime. Razer spokesperson Janine Warner told <em>The Verge</em> a day before this story went live that the release is on hold, and that it isn’t available to purchase in the US, pending regulatory clearance. Razer didn’t respond to a question about what clearance it was awaiting.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/804365/razer-raiju-v3-pro-ps5-dualsense-edge-features-price]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Looking to grab a new laptop, but don’t want to drain your savings doing it? You’re in luck because Dell has an incredible deal running on one of its most versatile models right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">The 15.6-inch Dell Vostro laptop is currently sitting at $600 on Amazon, a massive 70% off its usual price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving almost $1,400 on a machine that is powerful enough to handle both work and play well. Of course, deals like this don’t stick around for long, so we recommend acting fast to get your orders in before it expires or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Finish, Powerful Specs</h2>
<p>This sleek laptop flaunts a matte finish for that classic, premium look. The screen is a 15.6-inch Full HD display that pushes brilliant, sharp visuals while keeping them easier on the eyes. You’re getting narrow borders for a larger screen real estate, plus a 120Hz refresh rate that keeps everything smooth, even when you’re playing fast-paced games. The keyboard is also full-sized, featuring a 10-key numeric keypad. Typing for longer hours is going to be comfortable; just note that it’s not backlit.</p>
<p>For power, you have a 13th Gen Intel 5-core processor that outperforms older chips like the i5-1145G. It’s made for resource-intensive tasks, so working with heavier apps and pushing some creative boundaries won’t be an issue. Pair that with 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and you’ve got yourself a full-fledged multitasking companion that’s ready to take on your most productive, busiest days. There’s a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD storage built in. This is enough space to house all your important data, media content, and even games. SSD is also much faster than HDD, so you can expect significantly faster boot times than traditional drives.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, plus a ton of ports to connect all your essentials. These include USB 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 1, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C (data only), HDMI 1.4, SD 3.0 card slot, headset jack, and a Flip-Down RJ-45 Ethernet port. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there, whether you’re planning to use it for work, studies, or streaming.</p>
<p>Altogether, this is a great chance to grab this powerful laptop for significantly less. Just be sure to grab the deal quickly, as it might wrap up soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">We don’t expect to see another one this massive before Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>

<p>Use these Effortless Tower monthly codes for October 2025 in Roblox to gain some much-needed Skips in the game, allowing you to ease past the levels that you get stuck at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effortless Tower is one of the many obby (obstacle course) games in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-prison-pump-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, where players are tasked with simply getting from one point to another without hitting any of the obstacles in the way. Although many obby games on Roblox tend to be quite challenging, Effortless Tower offers a more enjoyable difficulty, making it a better option for players looking simply for a fun experience. There are over 5000 levels in Effortless Tower, each offering a different kind of challenge. Some, however, can be too difficult to surpass for some players, and this is where the Skips that can be acquired through codes come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players progress through the levels by simply moving around, jumping, and climbing, and each level is harder than the previous one. The game also offers players the option to teleport to the previous checkpoint with just a single clip, making it a very beginner-friendly gameplay experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The creator of Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and more feels that unique gameplay mechanics are more important than graphics in action games. </p>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-says-pretty-graphics-alone-dont-do-much-for-him-a-good-action-game-needs-mechanics-no-other-game-has/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya discussed the progress 3D action games have made lately and what he feels is most important in the genre for players and developers. Kamiya has been at the forefront of action games for a very long time and has delivered some of the biggest games in the genre. </p>



<h2 id="h-hideki-kamiya-wants-to-see-unique-experiences-which-only-that-one-game-can-offer">Hideki Kamiya Wants to See Unique Experiences Which “Only That One Game Can Offer”</h2>



<p>Kamiya first spoke about how he approaches new games, revealing that he will work on creating “a unique gameplay mechanic that can only be experienced in that game.” He elaborated with examples of systems he developed for games like Bayonetta and Okami. Bayonetta had a Witch Time system that slowed time whenever the player dodged an enemy’s attack. Okami has the Celestial Brush system, which lets players “directly affect the game world by drawing.”</p>



<p>The Bayonetta creator explained that as a player, he wants to “get excited by the unique experiences which only that one game can offer”, rather than improved graphics.&nbsp;Kamiya then praised how far 3D action games have come. He first spoke about how there weren’t many 3D action games for some years, but recently there has been a surge in “a lot of stylish, combo-based action titles.” He concluded, stating, “It’s amazing to me that someone can just start making a game and end up with something of that quality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Devil May Cry 5 hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/devil-may-cry-5-hits-new-sales-milestone-thanks-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new sales milestone</a> thanks to the Netflix adaptation. Additionally, Hideki Kamiya wants to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-devil-may-cry-director-wants-to-remake-first-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake the <span>original DMC game</span></a>.

During today's Direct, Sakurai confirmed that, when the game launches in November, what you see is what you get--there will be no downloadable content coming post-launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement came toward the end of the presentation, just as Sakurai was getting ready to sign off. "Just so you know, we're not planning any DLC. Everything is here," Sakurai said. He then confirmed that there are no plans to continue the Kirby Air Riders format going forward, saying he's "not planning on making this an ongoing series."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589678-kirby-air-riders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589678" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589678-kirby-air-riders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589678"></a><figcaption>Kirby Air Riders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589678-kirby-air-riders.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start," Sakurai continued. "So, I hope you don't miss this opportunity."</p><p dir="ltr">The full Direct livestream showed that Kirby Air Riders players will not be lacking for content, however, as multiple new modes, characters, costumes, and more were presented throughout the hour-long broadcast. Among the announcements were a story mode called Road Trip, multiple new characters, and My Machine, where players can build and customize their own air riders to take into races.</p><p dir="ltr">The Direct also confirmed that multiple key features from the original Kirby Air Ride would return in Kirby Air Riders.

            <p>Valve has taken a sledgehammer to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> skins market in a "small update", which allows players to trade five regular Covert skins for a fairly rare cosmetic for your knives and gloves.</p>
<p>That might not sound like a big deal, in fact, it probably sounds like a nice way of allowing casual players to cycle out older skins they don't like for something fancier. Here's the rub: Counter Strike 2 skins are tradable on the Steam market, and knife / gloves skins have historically sold for some serious money.</p>
<p>To understand why, you need to know the primary method of earning skins. In Counter Strike 2, players open weapon cases for skins. These are for the most part loot boxes containing weapon skins, and the rarest golden prize you can get from these cases are knife and gloves skins. Different weapon cases can give different varieties of knives and gloves, for example the Prisma 2 case drops the Stiletto knife with a random camo on it.</p>

<p>So prior to the small update, if you wanted a <em>really</em> cool looking knife, you had to pay real money for these weapon cases and try your luck on getting a knife. Alternatively, you could buy a knife you wanted. For reference a knife I like - the Stiletto Slaughter - sold for roughly £671 on October 9.</p><p>However, Fast forward to today, and that same knife sold for as low as £222. That's because of the update. You can now trade up five covert rarity skins for a knife, which has suddenly increased the supply of knives on the market, thus leading to a sudden drop in price across the board for knives.</p>
<p>As a result, on a macro level, the entire Counter Strike 2 skin market cap has dropped by 28.11 percent <a href="https://app.pricempire.com/trending?_gl=1*1khbnp4*_ga*MzQ0NzE4NTIuMTc1MTM3MDcwNA..*_ga_5YMSVJKHTZ*czE3NjEyMDkwMDUkbzkyJGcxJHQxNzYxMjEwOTUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">according to CS2 market analytics website Price Empire</a>. In other words, that's almost $2bn in less than a week. All because Valve made acquiring certain cosmetics in its popular game easier.</p>
<p>So, that's a shocking figure, but is this a good thing? It certainly depends on what position you're in. If you're a normal player with a few cool skins, and have felt priced out of getting a knife skin due to the pricey market surrounding them, this is certainly a great update for you. It's not so great if you're someone who invested money into Counter Strike 2 cosmetics rather than, y'know, stocks, a savings account, etc. In fact, it's potentially devastating for people who decided to invest a chunk of their wealth into Counter Strike skins over the years.</p>
<p>So pour one out to the Counter Strike 2 players who have found their inventories drop by like 30% plus, and if you've got an old Counter Strike account you've not opened up in a while, why not boot the game back up and see if you can get a fancy knife!</p>

<figure data-uuid="3e8d957c9bbec"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e8d957c9bbec/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has more amiibo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — that was already true when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">they were revealed during the September Nintendo Direct</a>, but a second one (that just aired) has unveiled three more.</p>
<p>Meta Knight and Shadow Star, King Dedede and Tank Star, and Chef Kawasaki and Hop Star will be joining the pricey set of amiibo in 2026. Meta Knight will swoop in on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, with King Dedede and Kawasaki to follow later in the year.</p>
<p>Like Kirby and Waddle Dee, these three are much bigger than your standard amiibo, but not only that, you can swap each of the characters between vehicles. They attach via magnets, meaning they clip on rather nicely indeed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Oh, and in the case of at least the Tank Star, you can change the positioning of the tracks and wheels, which will transform the vehicle in-game. Neat!</p>

<figure data-uuid="7a0f89b0cba84"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a0f89b0cba84/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, of course, the price — nothing official has been revealed, but given that retailers are listing Kirby and Waddle Dee at $49.99 in the US, we have to imagine that these other three will also retail at the same price. That means if you want all five, you'll have to cough up around $250 plus tax. Ouch...</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to arrive on Nintendo's console before the end of 2025, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">a post</a> from the game's official X account apologises to players and says the delay into 2026 is "to allow time for performance adjustments."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While development on #ELDENRING Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.<br>
We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.</p>

<p>FromSoft's game was playable at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> back in August, although various outlets (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">including ourselves</a>) reported disappointing performance on Nintendo's system, especially in handheld mode, with frame drops and stuttering especially noticeable in the more open areas.</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbqmniru&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The game launched elsewhere back in February 2022 to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/elden-ring">glowing reviews</a>, and was followed by the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_shadow_of_the_erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC in 2024, which will be included in the Tarnished Edition.</p>
<p>It's unsurprising, perhaps, that such an ambitious game might struggle on handheld hardware, but we'd hoped for a smooth, consistent experience on Switch 2 despite the familiar caveats of running a full-fat, cross-platform, home console game like this on portable hardware.</p>
<p>However, although it's disappointing to see this one slip into next year — at least for those of us who had holiday plans involving a trip to the Lands Between — if the devs need more time to make this edition not-quite-so-tarnished, so be it.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20251023_eldenring_tarnishededition_postponement">announced today in a press release</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring, titled Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, will no longer be released in 2025 and has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>A statement from FromSoftware cites the reason for the delay as the game needing more time "<em>for game performance adjustments</em>." A more specific release window beyond 2026 was not provided.</p>



<p>"<em>While development is progressing wholeheartedly towards release</em>," the statement begins, "<em>it was deemed that more time is required for game performance adjustments and the decision to change the release date was made.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Further announcements will follow once a specific release date has been determined. We offer our sincere apologies for inconveniencing players who have been eagerly awaiting the release of this title. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to make performance adjustments</em>."</p>



<p>Frankly, this delay isn't the biggest surprise. Besides the fact that the quality bar for technical performance in FromSoftware games is rocky at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">there were already reasonable concerns</a> with how this new version would run on the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, it's more powerful than the first Switch and definitely has a shot at running Elden Ring with some degree of stability, but it's no surprise to learn that FromSoftware needs more time to try and figure that out.</p>



<p>And based on their track record, even when it arrives it'll likely do so with its fair share of performance issues anyways. Of course, we hope that's not the case, but FromSoftware can't even put out games on current-gen consoles and PCs without significant performance issues.</p>



<p>Elden Ring also isn't the only major title that won't be hitting its initial 2025 release window on Nintendo Switch 2. Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">recently delayed indefinitely,</a> while Gearbox continues to fix and resolve the performance issues the game had on other platforms and addressing what we can only assume to be serious performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, if you want to take Elden Ring with you on the go, the only option remains PC handhelds like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck </a>or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>
