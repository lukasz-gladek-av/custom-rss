			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has yet to be released, but a talented fan has already managed to quite convincingly reimagine a small portion of the game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, an alleged leaked video of the new entry in the series started making the rounds, fooling the vast majority of fans with its great attention to detail. The short video, however, isn't a real leaked video of Grand Theft Auto 6, but an Unreal Engine 5 creation made to look as close as possible to the real leaked videos of the game, which surfaced online a while back, made by a developer known as Long Long Time in around one month. While it may have been disappointing to learn that the video wasn't the first look at the game in a very long time, it is still an interesting watch that showcases the developer's amazing talent at creating a very believable slice of a game we have seen very little of so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Confirmed fake. <a href="https://t.co/Hz8MNeSDTh">pic.twitter.com/Hz8MNeSDTh</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Synth Potatoü•î (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1868021749687931287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No matter when it will launch, Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to have a huge impact on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">video game industry</a> as a whole, so much so that some publishers are planning the release of their own titles so as not to coincide with its launch. Analysts also predict it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, and its failure could have some important consequences for the industry. Not that a failure is likely, judging from fake leaks like the one above, as the hype for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only getting bigger the more we inch closer to its late 2025 launch.</p>

Developer Creatures Inc. has still added myriad new missions and solo battles for players to interact with though, which somewhat recreates that opening day feeling of the digital trading card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of special cards added with Mythical Island too, which despite adding 86 cards total officially caps out at 68 cards. This means there are 18 of the "secrete" alternate art cards, including one immersive and one crown card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the mission front, Mythical Island Dex Missions have been added which, just like Genetic Apex, reward players with special shop tickets for collecting five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, and 60 unique Mythical Island cards. These can be used to redeem a Mew icon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Missions are added too, rewarding players with Rental Decks for collecting some of the major new cards available in Mythical Island including Celebi ex, Gyarados ex, Mew ex, Aerodactyl ex, and Pidgeot ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Themed Collections are also updated for Mythical Island. A variety of missions here reward different items for collecting, well, themed collections of cards, such as the Flower Travelers mission tasking players with collecting the three flower Pok√©mon in the Florges evolution line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Battles at the Step-Up and Expert tiers have also been updated with new challenges. Eight new Step-Up Battles have been added for Mythical Island decks, with players able to take on the second most challenging versions of decks such as Celebi ex and Mew ex to earn rewards such as pack hourglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another eight decks are added at the Expert Battle tier, which each reward seven Pack Hourglasses upon completion. The Step-Up Battles offer five, so a total of 96 Pack Hourglasses are available in solo battles alone, letting players open eight booster packs at no cost. This comes on top of 12 Pack Hourglasses that Creatures Inc. offered as free gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wonder Picks, these now appear to only serve Mythical Island packs and no longer Genetic Apex, though it's possible the new set is just dominating the random selection since the majority of players are presumably opening it on launch day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other changes to the game will emerge over the coming days, as the 86 new cards are slotted into the meta and shake up the player versus player scene. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">A new Vaporeon card is already threatening to make Misty even more powerful</a>, while Aerodactyl ex may lead Pok√©mon TCG Pocket's first control deck by stopping players evolving their Active Pok√©mon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pok√©mon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pok√©mon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red finally shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">a new teaser featuring Ciri</a> as a fully fledged Witcher on her own adventure. And while there wasn't much time for fun and frivolity in that preview, the developers are hinting that the card game Gwent will be featured in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba and executive producer Gosia Mitrƒôga were asked about Gwent's presence in The Witcher 4 during their joint interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw&amp;t=635s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Allies</a>. While neither Kalemba nor Mitrega came right out and said Gwent is in the game, they certainly seemed to confirm it.</p><p>"We really love [Gwent], and we also really carefully, always listen to the community‚Å†--which we love--and it's an amazing one. But I don't think anyone will be disappointed," said Mitrega. "It's a part of the experience, absolutely," agreed Kalema. "We also love Gwent."</p><p>Gwent was featured extensively in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and its popularity among players led CD Projekt Red to release a standalone title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gwent-review-heart-of-the-cards/1900-6417024/" data-ref-id="1900-6417024">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a>. Near the beginning of December, Hachette Boardgames UK and No Loading Games announced plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">release Gwent as a physical tabletop game</a> with a deck of 400 cards and a playmat. It's expected to be released in late 2025.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't currently have a release date, and CD Projekt Red only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">ramped up its team to over 400 developers</a> and officially began production. Kalemba also shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a scene-by-scene breakdown of the teaser trailer</a>, which sheds more light on Ciri's actions and dropped hints about a potentially different outcome than the one fans witnessed in the preview. </p>

Ciri had a big role role the third game, and as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">the first teaser for The Witcher 4</a>, she's going to be the main character in the next title. However, sharp-eared players may have already picked up on the fact that CD Projekt Red has recast Ciri for her upcoming starring role.</p><p>CD Projekt Red confirmed <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>'s report that Irish actress Ciara Berkeley voiced Ciri in the teaser trailer, and she will portray the heroine in The Witcher 4 as well. Jo Wyatt previously voiced Ciri in The Witcher 3 and its DLC. Berkeley only has a handful of credits to her name, including the TV miniseries Swing Bout, The Deceived, and Normal People. A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told The Gamer that "Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series."</p><p>There may potentially be other parts that are recast in the game, but Doug Cockle will be back as Ciri's mentor Geralt. Earlier this summer, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">confirmed that Geralt will be a part of the next game</a>, although he later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">walked back his comments</a> shortly before the teaser reveal at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards</a>. Geralt's voice was heard at the end of the teaser that streamed during the ceremony, but not in the standalone trailer on YouTube.</p><p>The Witcher 4 game director Sebastian Kalemba recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a breakdown of the first teaser</a>, which included details about the monster that Ciri was hunting as well as the young woman that she was trying to save. The scenes that played out in the trailer will be a part of The Witcher 4's narrative, and Kalemba hinted that players may be able to change the outcome in Ciri's favor.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't announced a release date for The Witcher 4 yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance Is Being Delisted in February]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-is-being-delisted-in-february.1063248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Wizards of the Coast and developer Tuque Games have announced that fantasy action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is being delisted at the end of February.</p>

<p>Rather curiously, the official announcement of said delisting comes as part of an update to the game's Steam page rather than a post on social media or a blog, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow">often the case</a> when games are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow">delisted or shut down</a>.</p>

<p>A new paragraph under&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance</em>'s "About This Game" section on Steam states that the game will be shut down on February 24th, and that it will no longer be available for purchase starting from that date. Presumably, this applies to the DLC as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=t9f3CKSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=TYklfScE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is going offline in February.</figcaption></figure><p>If you happen to already own&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>and you still want to play it (for some reason) after February 24th, you'll be able to do so, as the offline single-player mode will remain available. That goes for DLC as well.</p>

<p>It's a bit of a mystery that Wizards of the Coast and Tuque Games have decided to completely remove&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>from sale rather than allowing players to purchase an offline version of the game.</p>

<p>However, given the game's <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/11567/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">weak critical reception</a>, that mystery might not be so puzzling after all. Our own Tyler was scarcely more positive than many others in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, citing awkward controls and poor AI as reasons for awarding his 6.5 score.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is (or was, I suppose), it's a co-op hack-and-slash action-RPG in which you and your friends play as one of four iconic&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>heroes: Drizzt Do'Urden, Catti-brie, Wulfgar, and Bruenor Battlehammer.</p>

<p>Playing as one of these heroes (or all of them if you have a full party), you'll take on iconic&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>monsters, explore the legendary land of Icewind Dale, and earn rewards from defeating tough bosses, allowing you to take on ever more challenging quests.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/623280/Dungeons__Dragons_Dark_Alliance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2037-PPSA02680_00-7187320704565923" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dark-alliance/9MZ55WCBW7TK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so if you want to keep playing it after February, I'd recommend picking it up now if you haven't already.</p>

            <p>
Great was the adulation last week when FromSoftware <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-software-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign-a-three-player-co-op-spin-off">announced a new Elden Ring game</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> - and great the lamentation from certain quarters when it was revealed to be a co-op-focussed experience. If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">the spectacle of Geoff Keighley's fashion friends</a>, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick from one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so as to prepare for a boss battle at the end of each 15-minute in-game day. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The map is surrounded by murderous weather that closes in as night approaches, shrinking the navigable area to a boss arena - a nod to the battle royale genre. Each round lasts three days, culminating in a clash with one of eight unlockable headline antagonists. In between rounds, you can spend a currency called Murk on cosmetics at the Roundtable fort, and equip relics that provide permanent character upgrades.
</p>
<p>
It feels like it's heavily based on observation of how more dedicated fans play and tinker with Elden Ring - a speedrunner remix with the seamless co-op mod, and some confusing allusions to the wider Fromverse in the presence of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s Nameless King. The map's buildings and terrain hazards change between visits - larger surprises include volcanoes and invading field bosses, like our old chum <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-margit-boss-fight-walkthrough">Margit</a> the Fell Omen - so it's more replayable than it might sound for a game with "only" one map and eight tacit "chapters" that (going by my back-of-napkin mathematics) you could theoretically finish in a single day.
</p>
<p>
From have made plenty of multiplayer games, of course. The Souls series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> and Elden Ring have intricate co-op and PvP functions by means of in-game guilds, together with asynchronous online features like player phantoms and graffiti. But this is the first time they've made anything Soulsy where multiplayer is a menu option, rather than something slowly peeled back and investigated while travelling alone. So is there anything here for people who'd rather not squad up against the hordes?
</p>
<p>
The immediate good news is that you can play Nightreign both alone and offline. During solo play, the game also scales down enemy health pools, and there's no PvP invader element to interfere with your meanderings. 
</p>
<p>
It's also not a "live service" game - as in, one that is openly designed to expand over time by means of regular, perhaps separately sold DLC injections and a season pass model. "Once you you buy Nightreign you get the complete package, everything is unlockable out of the gate," game director Junya Ishizaki <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">told Ian of the Games Network, shortly before the reveal</a>. "So we want it to be clear that this is what we wanted to make. It's not intended as a live service game."
</p><p>
Beyond that, though, the picture grows muddled. According to Ishizaki, Nightreign is very much co-op-first. It's balanced primarily around three-player teams (somewhat arbitrarily, there's no two-player support), this being the "sweet spot" that avoids Nightreign becoming "too overwhelming or too busy", with players splitting up to farm the map and reuniting at sunset.
</p>
<p>
It's also missing certain key handholds for solo Ringers. For one thing, there are no Spirit Ash items to let you summon helpful NPCs, though according to Ishizaki, one of the preset heroes does have "a sort of spiritual buddy as a gameplay mechanic". 
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, given the ever-changing map, there's also no longer the ability to leave soapstone messages on the geography. This might sound trivial, but those messages add so much to FromSoft's worlds, even when they're <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/elden-ring-dogs">calling everything a dog</a>. You will, at least, be able to harvest treasure dropped by other slain players via asynchronous online.
</p>
<p>
Chuck these morsels of insight into the blender of reckless deduction, and you might come away with the speculation that Nightreign supports solo player but doesn't especially encourage it. Play alone, and by the sounds of things, you'll be cutting against the grain - which, admittedly, is the norm for certain dedicated Soulsers, with their nightmarish talk of completing whole games without levelling up once or wearing any clothes.
</p><p>
If the above has you down in the dumps, the best news of all is that Nightreign won't necessarily be the first of many multiplayer-centric games. "We don't really have a plan in terms of, oh we're going to make more spin-offs or this is going to be a one-off time one-time thing," Ishizaki told IGN. "This was purely sort of happenstance of me wanting to direct my own game and wanting to use Elden Ring and that battle design that I took part in as a base to this game, and my interest in online co-op games as well."</p>
<p>All that notwithstanding, the Nightreign concept does seemingly fit in well with Hidetaka Miyazaki's comments earlier this year about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">working on smaller projects in future</a>. Perhaps they'll find a way to ship a whittled-down singleplayer offering next?

<p>Elden Ring‚Äôs Game Director Junya Ishizaki has revealed that Elden Ring Nightreign can only be played as a trio or solo.</p>



<p>The news came from a new interview with IGN, where&nbsp;Ishizaki&nbsp;revealed that the game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play solo if you wish. Ishizaki flat-out said that you cannot play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> as a duo.</p>



<p><strong>Junya Ishizaki:&nbsp;</strong>The game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play it as a solo player.</p>



<p><strong>IGN:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, great. Or in a pair?</p>



<p><strong>Junya Ishizaki:&nbsp;</strong>No, it‚Äôs either one-player or three-player.</p>



<p>Ishizaki later continued, ‚ÄúThe reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is scheduled to release sometime in 2025, with players being able to sign up and register to test the game starting January 10. </p>



<p>‚ÄúThe network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,‚Äù FromSoftware and Bandai Namco said. ‚ÄúVarious technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,‚Äù the test description reads. Players can <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sign up for the test here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/17/the-thaumaturge-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-thaumaturge-review.1063224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/17/the-thaumaturge-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Thaumaturge is an RPG where you collect monsters and use them to fight. This might sound like a certain other game, but this is set in Warsaw in 1906, the monsters are all horrific demons, and it heavily features the real-life fascinating weirdo Rasputin. So, there are a few differences, not to mention the bleak, melancholic tone and the fact that some of the people here are worse than the monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thaumaturge | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL57ftcwSSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you‚Äôre curious, a Thaumaturge is someone who can sense emotions and intentions that have been imprinted onto items using the help of salutors ‚Äì those demonic monsters. As you can imagine, this makes them an investigative force to be reckoned with, as all you have to do is touch a couple of things and everything you could possibly need to know presents itself. This is convenient, as it turns out Warsaw happens to be full of unrest, so there‚Äôs an awful lot of mysteries to be solved as desperation, greed, and betrayal are everywhere.</p>


<p>Enter Wictor Szulski who, at the beginning of the game, is looking for the famous faith healer Grigori Rasputin to help him regain control over his Thaumaturgy powers. Naturally, he is successful just in time for Wictor to have a dream about his father‚Äôs death and return to Warsaw. Rasputin, ever the mysterious weirdo, tags along and you find yourself in Warsaw in the early stages of a revolution.</p>
<p>The story and setting here is the highlight of the game. Rasputin in particular is a confounding presence, exactly what he wants is a complete mystery until late in the game and it‚Äôs the thing that I kept thinking about whilst I wasn‚Äôt playing. He‚Äôs portrayed well too, featuring all the weird cult-like behaviour you‚Äôd expect from a charismatic faith healer, whilst he himself is adamant he‚Äôs just helping people. He‚Äôd fit well into the right-wing manosphere these days. Outside of Rasputin, every character here has their own motives and feelings just waiting for you to find them imprinted onto a discarded onion or something, which is great ‚Äì the writing can‚Äôt really be faulted, but sometimes its delivery falls a little flat.</p>


<p>There‚Äôs a bit at the end of the prologue that was a bit unclear and I had to go back over it in my head to piece it together, though perhaps I missed something. At one point I was also kidnapped, tied up, and interrogated by someone who turned out to be a childhood friend and the fact that Wictor just casually assisted this kidnapper in a fight afterwards and continued to associate with him is just flat out crazy.</p>
<p>The bigger issue with all the investigating is that, as you‚Äôre a Thaumaturge, you press R2 and Wictor clicks his fingers, giving you a trail to follow to the selected objective. You can‚Äôt fast travel within areas either, so you spend an awful lot of time running around following a trail of particles, pressing R2 again every few seconds because the trail constantly disappears for no good reason. It soon starts to feel less like investigating and more like fetch quests, but you‚Äôre fetching people‚Äôs secrets. I forgave this issue pretty quickly though due to the strength of the setting and writing though, especially once I started collecting salutors in the city.</p>
<p>Salutors latch onto people with flaws ‚Äì Wictor‚Äôs flaw is Pride, for example, it drew his main salutor, the Upyr, to him when he was young. Thaumaturges can tame and use salutors, but for everyone else a salutor influences the environment around the person with the flaw. When Wictor finds one, he must discover who has the flaw so he can bring it out into the open, which allows him to fight and then capture the salutor. Wictor normally wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage this, but with the help of Rasputin he can master multiple salutors. From the Upyr, through Djinns and all the way to Golems, the designs for the many salutors are excellent, if not entirely unique.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre not just for investigating either, there‚Äôs a combat system in this game that is quite unique. Each round, Wictor and a salutor have an action, and you can switch between any salutors you‚Äôve unlocked at will. Actions take a certain amount of time ‚Äì a short action takes one round, whilst a long one takes two rounds. The same is true of each enemy and you can see what order they‚Äôll be attacking and what they‚Äôll be doing at the top of the screen. Your attacks have a variety of effects in addition to dealing damage, such as lowering an enemy‚Äôs focus, causing bleeding damage each round, and so on. Some attacks can slow down or even cancel an enemy‚Äôs planned attack if you‚Äôre lucky. If you remove all of an enemy‚Äôs focus, they‚Äôll cancel their planned attack and be open to an extra powerful yet very quick attack as well.</p>
<p>On top of this, each of the salutors have their own attacks that vary wildly. The weird chicken one, the Lelek, is excellent at removing enemy focus whilst giving you some bonuses, but doesn‚Äôt really deal much damage to health, whilst the Djinn is rather powerful but its attacks have a cost as well. It‚Äôs a system that‚Äôs deep and unique enough that it takes a while for it to click, but once it does it‚Äôs very enjoyable and very adaptable, especially with the ridiculous amount of salutors you end up with.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a little unbalanced though. If you do side stuff you‚Äôll either find the story quests to be too easy when you return to them or sometimes bump into a side quest that‚Äôs a bit too hard for you. It‚Äôs also weirdly underutilised, to the point where you can go a few hours without a fight and then the game will come up with an absurd reason to make one happen, one so transparently an excuse that it isn‚Äôt even mentioned after the fight. Not a big problem, but a little immersion breaking.</p>

<p>Crucially for a game with a lot of talking, the voice acting is mostly good, with only a few slightly off-kilter moments. The music is fantastic too, hosts of melancholic violins and the combat music is still stuck in my head. It‚Äôs a pretty good looking game as well, though character‚Äôs face movements and expressions look a little too muppet-y sometimes, but the environments are detailed and the game runs well throughout.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-right-when-the-new-year-starts-%E2%80%93-rumor.1063218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed right when the new year starts, judging from some reported behind-the-scenes chatter.</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/reflecting-on-the-game-awards-2024-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry Microcast</a>, Chris Dring reported that he has heard some chatter from other people suggesting that the console could be revealed right when the new year starts. As this is chatter, however, Chris Dring stressed that it shouldn't be taken as fact.</p>
<p>Shortly after Chris Dring's statement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing became public, Nintendtalk revealed that insiders at major third-party developers suggest that a January reveal for the console is definitely in the cards. Samus Hunter added that the system's official announcement may have been brought forward to early January, before the release of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on January 16th, due to the recent leaks from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">accessories manufacturers</a>. As all these sources have questionable reliability, however, we have to take all they've said with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Source: Nintendo to reveal Nintendo Switch 2 in January. This is coming from a Major Third Party developer contact I have. Here‚Äôs what they say about the console:</p>
<p>‚ÄúGet ready to play modern AAA offerings on your Nintendo system in 2025‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äî NintenTalk (@NintenTalk) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenTalk/status/1868715333881938264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am not sure how much longer I can contain my hype for Nintendo Switch 2 based on literally everything I am hearing that I can't say here or in videos. Good news is, it sounds like I won't be waiting much longer...</p>
<p>‚Äî Nintendo Prime (@NintyPrime) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintyPrime/status/1868723760955900325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo may advance the next-generation Switch reveal with an announcement that possibly could come before DK. This is to address recent leaks especially of accessories to ensure official news for the public. The remaining announcements of Switch games may come a little later.</p>
<p>‚Äî Samus Hunter | Nintendo Leak and News Inside (@SamusHunter2) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamusHunter2/status/1868898948825727415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Where there's smoke, there's fire, as they say, so it seems very likely that a Nintendo Switch 2 reveal may not be too far off into the future. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>Quick, the world is in peril, your adopted daughter is under threat, and nearby villagers are being terrorised by monsters. What do you do? Oh, you're sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You're playing a card game with a dude called "Aldert". The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you're just sitting there. Playing another "cow" card. Okay.</p>
<p>Guess you'll be happy to learn that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">Witcher 4</a> developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">recently trailered</a> Ciri-led sequel. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/cd-projekt-knows-why-were-all-really-here-gwent-is-coming-back-in-the-witcher-4-and-the-devs-dont-think-anyone-will-be-disappointed/">PC Gamer</a>, two developers at CD Projekt Red responded to a recent interview question about the in-universe card game with some confidence, saying: "I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"We really love the game," said executive producer Gosia Mitrƒôga in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmbhFPninuw?feature=shared&amp;t=637">interview with Easy Allies</a>. "And we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love... But I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"Yeah for sure," added game director Sebastian Kalemba. "It's a part of the experience, so absolutely. We also love Gwent."</p>
<p>It was perhaps a no-brainer that the card game be revived for the sequel, considering it was popular enough to spawn a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">free-to-play multiplayer spin-off</a> and a standalone singleplayer adventure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>. Both of which, as card games, were pretty solid. </p><p>Gwent as it originally appeared in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> was inspired by physical card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112/condottiere">Condottiere</a>, with a few differences in both visuals and rules to make it fit into the world of the cat-eyed freelancers and sneaky bog witches. The multiplayer version, meanwhile, has mutated from its original design throughout the years, to the extent that any time I've booted it up I find have no idea how best to use my cards anymore. I'm interested to see exactly what form it'll take in the Witcher 4, and if my wintry tactic of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-annoying-thing-i-like-to-do-in-gwent">covering the board in frost</a> will once again be viable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-cut-back-on-%E2%80%98toilet-humor%E2%80%99-says-gearbox.1063209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gearbox‚Äôs Narrative Director says it will reduce toilet humor for its next installment in the Borderlands series, Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>The revelation came from the X account (formerly Twitter) of Gearbox Narrative Director Sam Wrinkler, who previously worked on both Tiny Tina‚Äôs Wonderlands and Borderlands 3. In response to a question about the narrative direction pertaining to jokes, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Winkler said</a>, ‚ÄúNot at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3‚Äôs overabundance of toilet humor.‚Äù</p>



<p>He later elaborated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna say there‚Äôs no toilets, but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch, I‚Äôm gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder.‚Äù</p>



<p>The Borderlands series has always tried to have a boatload of humor, and Winkler‚Äôs comments might be a positive sign for those who didn‚Äôt enjoy the humor in Borderlands 3, which was criticized for having fairly lousy humor. A simple search on Google (it‚Äôs still a thing, ya know?) of Borderlands 3 humor pulls up loads of search results of people criticizing the game and its cringe-like humor.</p>

The tone of the jokes have remained relatively consistent throughout the franchise‚Äôs run, which takes in 2012‚Äôs Borderlands 2, 2014‚Äôs The Pre-Sequel, and 2019‚Äôs Borderlands 3. Indeed, toilet humor has served Borderlands well so far, with total franchise sales now up to an impressive 81 million copies. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-with-teaser-trailer-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2024">the debut teaser trailer for Borderlands 4</a> suggested a darker tone this time, and the latest trailer, unveiled at The Game Awards 2024, reinforced this shift.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The TGA 2024 trailer showed snippets of first-person shooting and a few returning characters, including Claptrap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb from Gearbox:</p><blockquote>Revealed at The Game Awards, a new trailer introduces The Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high. A world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect Order, unleashing mayhem across Kairos, the most dangerous planet discovered so far in the Borderlands universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Borderlands 4 is the most ambitious Borderlands to date, lovingly hand-crafted by the development studio that first forged the looter shooter genre. The title evolves the series‚Äô gameplay and storytelling in new ways while delivering on the quintessential Borderlands experience fans know and love, including:</blockquote><blockquote>Intense action, badass Vault Hunters, and billions of wild and deadly weapons on an all-new planet ruled by a ruthless tyrant.</blockquote><blockquote>The deepest and most diverse Vault Hunter skill trees of any Borderlands title yet, giving players an unprecedented level of expression through their builds. Paired with the most expansive loot chase yet, players will have all the tools they need to seek out and perfect the build that best matches their style.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will be able to seamlessly travel between zones and become immersed in a more dynamic world featuring events and discoverable side missions that encourage and reward exploration.</blockquote><blockquote>New traversal mechanics add to the exploration for loot and add new dimensions to combat. A vehicle that can be summoned almost anywhere will have players racing across the beautiful vistas of Kairos in style.</blockquote><blockquote>Fight solo or in co-op with up to three other players in this immense sci-fi adventure, packed with free-form combat and exploration, pulse-pounding boss fights, infinitely varied loot drops, and an eclectic cast of unforgettable characters new and old.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">"Borderlands 4 is about freedom and being badass,‚Äù said Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford. ‚ÄúThis is by far the biggest and most insane world we‚Äôve ever made - it's overloaded with jerkface ratnozzle scrote monsters that need to be put down with the most over-the-top hardcore nuts op guns and loot in any game ever. Oh, and the story also seriously kicks ass!‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is set to launch at some point in 2025, and comes after the disastrous launch of the Borderlands movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-most-op-characters.1063203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-most-op-characters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôve spent any time with NetEase‚Äôs new hero shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">Marvel Rivals</a>, then you already know that the game features many powerful heroes and villains. Yet with a base roster of 33 characters, some were inevitably going to rise to the top of the heap once players got their hands on them. Memes and humorous videos about the game have already taken social media by storm, with many focusing on which characters are causing tons of frustration and annoyance for the game‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">ten million plus playerbase</a>. After playing a few hundred matches of my own, I‚Äôve found certain ones are far more dreaded than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So today, we‚Äôre going to rank the top Marvel Rivals characters by how much they‚Äôre driving fans crazy. Obviously this list could change in the future depending on new additions or balance patches, but for now, here are the most overpowered characters in Marvel Rivals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Moon Knight</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-moon-knight-1734382313453.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Marc Spector, aka Moon Knight, may be a relatively low level character powerwise in the pantheon of Marvel comics, but he‚Äôs a serious threat in Rivals. Both his Crescent Darts and Moon Blades can bounce not just between enemies who are close together, but also between his Ankhs, which crafty players can place at all sorts of weird angles to get bonus damage without their foes even knowing where they‚Äôre being hit from. This is even easier for Moon Knight players because of how agile he is, easily scaling buildings or vantage points with his double jump and hookshot skills. And while his ultimate, Hand of Khonshu, is easily dodgeable if spotted, the fact that it comes from directly above means many Moon Knights have discovered it‚Äôs best to place it slightly behind the enemy team. This takes advantage of the natural inclination for players to back up when they can‚Äôt instantly see where an ultimate attack is coming from, leading them straight into the damage zone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He does require forethought and positioning, but once you grasp the fundamentals, Moon Knight can devastate an enemy team before he‚Äôs even spotted.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Star-Lord</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-star-lord-1734382335778.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The title of ‚ÄúLegendary Star-Lord‚Äù may be something Peter Quill calls himself more than anyone else does, but in Rivals he more than lives up to the hype. Playing like a variant of Overwatch‚Äôs Tracer with the ability to fly instead of zip back in time, Star-Lord is a lightning-fast triggerman. His Element Guns deal high damage at a rapid rate, he can fly out of a hot zone at a moment‚Äôs notice, and his Stellar Shift dodge ability, for which he has two charges before cooldown, not only reload his guns but also grant him invincibility frames. When it comes to hit and run tactics, few Rivals characters can match Star-Lord, which makes his ultimate even more outrageous. Galactic Legend couples his hard hitting and quick reloading weapons with free flight and auto-aim, meaning that unless someone snipes him the second he activates it, there‚Äôs little the enemy team can do but scramble for cover and wait the ability out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He still needs to be careful health-wise due to being a squishy DPS character, so he can be something of a glass cannon. But if you‚Äôre quick and good at managing cooldowns, Star-Lord can feel unbeatable in the right hands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Scarlet Witch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-scarlet-witch-1734382357921.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no way the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-powerful-marvel-characters">strongest Avenger</a> was going to sit out a Marvel hero shooter, and Wanda Maximoff makes another return to the spotlight as one of Rivals‚Äô most deadly duelists. Perfect for Moira players from Overwatch who couldn‚Äôt help but get the most eliminations in a match while ostensibly being a healer (guilty as charged), Scarlet Witch can drain enemy health bars without needing to aim much. Joining her lock-on magic are powerful Chthonian Burst missiles which she can toss frequently, and two charges of Mystic Projection, which gives her free flight and a ‚ÄòPhased‚Äô state that allows her to avoid all damage for a short time. Once you get into a rhythm, Wanda can annihilate foes at both close and long range while easily ducking out of retaliation or enemy ultimates without even needing to be well-positioned. And then there‚Äôs her ultimate, Reality Erasure, and while it does have a long charge time, it instantly vaporizes any enemy within range. It‚Äôs more than worth the wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Scarlet Witch main myself, plenty of players probably hate me. But if loving Wanda in this game is wrong, I don‚Äôt want to be right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Hela</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-hela-1734382389004.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This one might not be as obvious to casual players, but real Rivals heads are sure to know why Hela makes this list. The Goddess of Death lives up to her namesake, with her Nightsword Thorn primary fire able to wipe out heroes at a far distance with only a couple of critical strikes, and her Piercing Night attack often killing them outright with a single cast. Although she‚Äôs not technically a sniper, she can basically function as one in the hands of a skilled enough player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let‚Äôs not forget her ultimate, Goddess of Death, which allows Hela to soar above the field and rain hellfire from above. Although it is technically possible to drain her health bar in this state, it‚Äôs not really worth it because she gets a HP boost, meaning it takes pretty much the entire duration of the ability‚Äôs cast time to shoot her down. This means she can clear a point single-handedly by forcing the enemy team to flee for cover, making her an early favorite for character bans once you reach Diamond rank in Competitive Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor and Loki may be more popular characters, but Hela is the true Asgardian threat you need to watch out for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Jeff</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-jeff-1734382415946.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No one would have thought that an adorable baby shark could cause so much hysteria, but Jeff the Land Shark has quickly become one of the most hated heroes in Marvel Rivals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? He‚Äôs a healer, and he‚Äôs not exactly built for the front lines (even if his primary attack is deceptively powerful and he has a damage reduction against critical hits.) But the real reason Jeff is so feared is his ultimate ability, It‚Äôs Jeff!, where the little land shark reveals his monstrous appetite. Jeff is invincible while casting and, after selecting a circular area, he instantly swallows everyone within it, friend and foe alike. Enemies do take damage when they‚Äôre in Jeff‚Äôs stomach, but the real value of this ability is that he can move with other players inside him, meaning Jeffs will often spit their foes into bottomless pits. Some will even guarantee the kills by committing suicide, leaping over the edge with enemies inside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is counterplay to this ability (Scarlet Witch can usually escape being swallowed with a well-timed Mystic Projection, for example), but the indignity of being eaten and thrown off a cliff by a baby shark has enraged many a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He may be intended for keeping his allies healthy, but smart use of his ultimate makes Jeff an absolute menace on the battlefield.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Iron Fist</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-iron-fist-1734382439419.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No character inspires more primal terror in the hearts of Marvel Rivals players than Lin Lie, the Immortal Iron Fist. This master martial artist has far and away the most insane powers in the game. Not only do his rapid fire punches allow him to assassinate healers and duelists with impunity while giving him bonus health in the process, but he also has four air jumps before cooldown, as well as a spin kick that dashes him forward. This means that he can effectively fly with well-timed use of his attacks and jumps, chasing characters like Iron Man <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAlerts/status/1866010702080627027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literally through the sky</a>. But that‚Äôs not even the worst of it. He can also use Dragon‚Äôs Defense as a parry maneuver against virtually any attack in the game. <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAlerts/status/1866010702080627027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No, really</a>. He can somehow prevent himself from being nuked, eaten by Jeff or erased from reality by Wanda with nothing more than a well-timed flex of his shoulders. If there‚Äôs an Iron Fist on the enemy team with even a moderate understanding of his toolkit, you‚Äôre in for a world of pain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, NetEase, do something about this man. My healers are dying.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

<p>Jeff's Winter Splash Festival will see players controlling their own adorable land shark in two teams competing to cover the arena in coloured snow.</p>

<p>As for the Gallery Card, completing various tasks will reward players with limited-time items, including the Jeff the Land Shark: Cuddly Fuzzlefin costume and other rewards.</p>
<p>In further news, the game's creative director Guangyun "Guangguang" Chen confirmed to <a href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-devs-confirm-cross-progression-is-in-the-works-but-platform-rules-remain-a-barrier">Dot Esports</a> that cross-progression is in the works to allow players to progress freely across multiple platforms. Cross-play between PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S is already included, but progression is currently limited to each platform.</p><p>"Cross-progression involves a lot of platform-specific rules, we're still looking at it and how to solve it," said Chen. "Once the team is ready, once we've figured it out, we'll be sharing to everyone and players will be the first to know."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch at the start of the month. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Borderlands 4 will dial down the toilet humour compared to the previous game, so don't expect any "skibidi" quotes.</p>
<p>Narrative director Sam Winkler described Borderlands 4 as Gearbox's "most ambitious game yet" and said he's happy to "work with some of the funniest people I know".</p>
<p>A response to Winkler's post asked if, judging by trailers, the game will have darker humour, to which he replied: "Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3's overabundance of toilet humor."</p>
<p>He added, in a further response: "I'm not gonna say there's no toilets but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder."</p>

<p>The Borderlands series isn't exactly serious in its tone, but the third game was criticised for its humour. For some, though, this didn't detract from its shooting mechanics.</p>
<p>Reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Eurogamer Borderlands 3 review</a>: "No, it's not a particularly cerebral experience, but nor is it trying to be; while stuffed with gore and violence and frankly infantile humour, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is a solid shooter with a meaty 30-ish hour campaign, plentiful - if repetitive - busywork, and a colourful cast of hard-to-forget characters."</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">new trailer for Borderlands 4 was shown</a>, which revealed its new planet and four playable vault hunters.</p>
<p>It's looking plenty outlandish, but the lack of poop and fart jokes will make for a more satisfying release once the game launches in 2024.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">Skibidi Toilet</a> (lucky you), it's a very silly internet animation made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off game Nightreign will feature enemies from Dark Souls, its director has confirmed.</p>
<p>Souls fans certainly spotted some familiar enemies in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Nightreign's reveal trailer</a> at last week's The Game Awards, most notably The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> who rides atop a dragon firing lightning bolts.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477">Famitsu</a>, director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that a "small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign thanks to the "influence of the Night King".</p>

<p>He added this is to add to the sense of "chaos" that the night brings. It's all part of the parallel universe of Nightreign, which is clearly allowing FromSoftware to nod to its past.</p>
<p>As the Dark Souls social media account teased: "In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>And while Ishizaki specifically mentioned only the Dark Souls series, perhaps Bloodborne and Sekiro enemies could make an appearance too.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">IGN</a> spotted, the trailer includes player characters battling a three-headed creature with an exposed ribcage that appears to be the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls. Further, an official screenshot released by the developer includes a giant spider who could well be The Duke's Dear Freja from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ss_7a6e385e299b4848943daf2c6bc8218c16cd9497.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Is this Freja? | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further, fans have likened the playable character the Duchess to Bloodborne's Lady Maria thanks to her quickstep ability, while Wylder's claw shot resembles the grappling hook of Sekiro. This is certainly more speculative, but judging by the increased mobility of the playable characters in Nightreign, there does seem to be some influence from across FromSoftware's previous games.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also described Nightreign to Famitsu as a dense but short game that condenses RPG fundamentals into a single mission.</p>
<p>Communication with others, meanwhile, will be with pins and gestures to continue the "loose connection" with fellow players established in previous Souls games. There won't be PvP this time, though, and there's no invasion method.</p>
<p>Lastly, within the roguelite structure, if players successfully pass all three days of the game's day and night cycle, they will obtain relics for various boosting effects.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">new sales total for Elden Ring</a>, which has now sold more copies than the entire Dark Souls series had prior to its release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mistwalker's FANTASIAN Neo Dimension JRPG can now be checked out prior to purchase, thanks to a new free demo released by publisher Square Enix on all platforms.</p>
<p>The demo lets gamers experience the game's first few hours and test the multi-dimensional battle mechanics. Moreover, as is customary with post-launch free demos, players will be able to continue their journey as Leo by carrying over their progress to the full game if they purchase it afterward.</p>
<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension initially launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive. However, it has recently debuted on PC and all main consoles (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), with great overall reception. The game designed by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi scored a nine out of ten in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Instead of attempting to do away with the tropes that have dominated the genre for a very long time, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension fully embraces them to deliver a compelling experience that feels markedly "Final Fantasy" without being an actual part of the series. The story, as a whole, may not be anything special, but the little interactions between the characters, some emotional moments, and the solid combat system, which only improves as the adventure proceeds and the challenge level increases, make for one of the best JRPGs released in the past few years.</em></p>

            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has been released to finally tackle issues with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> performance.</p>
<p>A new Balanced graphics mode has been added to combine Quality mode settings (and raytracing) with Performance mode resolution, targeting 40fps. It requires a display capable of achieving 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The Performance mode has been adjusted for a more consistent framerate, while raytracing in Quality and Balanced modes will have a less noisy image. Perhaps more damning is the ability to switch off the PS5 Pro's PSSR entirely.</p>

<p>PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony's AI upscaling technology, but it appears to be causing issues for some developers - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/improvements-to-alan-wake-2s-ps5-pro-patch-still-not-ready">Remedy included</a>. Bloober also appeared to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">issues with it for its Silent Hill 2 remake</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">latest patch</a> is available on PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S and PC. On those other platforms, a couple of minor fixes have been implemented as well as other optimisations.</p>

<p>Ahead of the PS5 Pro's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">Remedy detailed the visual improvements the console would bring</a>, though initially the results were not as expected. With this latest patch, it's hoped the game now runs as intended on PS5 Pro.</p>

			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently participated in the virtual <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/2024-annual-shareholder-meeting?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annual Shareholders Meeting</a>, answering questions on a variety of topics that involve the corporation's activities. Usually, on these occasions, gaming is largely ignored, being a relatively minor portion of Microsoft's revenues.</p>
<p>However, this time around, Nadella was actually asked about the early ROI (return on investment) on the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and about progress made in 2024 on the overarching gaming strategy outlined by Microsoft. Nadella was very positive in his reply, and he also touched upon some of the brand's changes related to multiplatform releases.</p>
<p><em>I‚Äôm feeling very, very good about where we are in gaming. In fact, right now, this is like the peak season for gaming, obviously with Black Ops and the new Call of Duty, and it‚Äôs just been fantastic to see the launch and the marketing around it, the buzz around it and the love for gaming.</em></p>
<p><em>If I think about it, right, we chose the secular growth category in entertainment, which we think is gaming, and said, let‚Äôs double down on it, let‚Äôs ‚Äì and it‚Äôs been a passion for Microsoft ever since.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, I think Flight Simulator launched before Windows or Office even, and so it‚Äôs like one of the longest franchises in this company. And so we said, let‚Äôs take that joy of gaming everywhere. And that‚Äôs why even these ads with Xbox now, where we are redefining what it means to be an Xbox fan, it‚Äôs about being able to enjoy Xbox on all your devices.</em></p>
<p><em>So our strategy with Activision content now is in full force. We feel fantastic about the progress we‚Äôve made. And more importantly, I think, long term, as a company, we can bring the best of AI innovation, cloud innovation, console innovation, PC innovation to build the best games that can be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards 2024, Xbox fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that another of the former exclusives, The Outer Worlds 2, would launch day and date on PlayStation 5, too, after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/outer-worlds-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> only for PC and Xbox Series S|X back in 2021. It's another hint that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusives-are-gone-for-good-says-jez-corden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> about Microsoft abandoning exclusives for good might be true. While fans may riot at the idea, it certainly makes financial sense, at least on paper.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has stated the company's belief that unique creativity is more important than development costs.</p>
<p>Discussing the rising cost of game development in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">investor Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto admitted the company's development expenses have increased each year. "Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>However, creative and intriguing ideas are most important, a view shared by other members of the Nintendo board.</p>

<p>"We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with," said Miyamoto. "With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo aims to nurture developers who "take this unique concept to heart", allocate funds as necessary, and release games "only after we are confident in the product".</p>
<p>Miyamoto added it's "possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs".</p>
<p>"We believe that not all products require large costs," he continued. "Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."</p><p>Senior managing executive officer and corporate director Shinya Takahashi commented: "I believe unique titles that are small in scale, but worth polishing can be created by expanding on the ideas of a small number of developers, rather than spending large sums of money on every game. While overall research and development costs are rising, there are certain products for which expenses remain relatively stable, depending on our approach."</p>
<p>Ko Shiota, senior executive officer and corporate director, added the merging of home console and handheld console for the Switch allowed Nintendo to integrate its development environments, which will continue with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Because we are already familiar with Nintendo Switch, maintaining a similar basis for development environments in the future will allow us to carry over the experience we have already built, which should lead to a reduction in research and development costs over time," he said.</p>
<p>The investor question follows high profile and expensive flops from the past year, including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> from Warner Bros. and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-initial-development-deal-was-reportedly-200m-though-its-financial-and-human-cost-was-far-higher">cancelled Concord</a> from Sony.</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is gearing up for its Switch 2 launch. While reports have suggested its graphics could be comparable to the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the ability to run Unreal Engine 5, its specs are likely to be less powerful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In this modern world of ¬£700 consoles and iterative updates it‚Äôs easy to forget the extra expenses involved in gaming ‚Äì especially when it comes to controllers. When even basic controllers cost upwards of ¬£50 apiece, any kind of local multiplayer becomes extra expensive. Multiply those costs by the various competing consoles and you have a wallet-busting experience. Gamesir have become increasingly engaged in the console and PC accessory space in recent years and their latest controller promises to solve the dilemma of multiple expensive controllers by offering one that works across PC, Switch, and mobile gaming, at an accessible pricepoint.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir Tarantula Pro - Pro by Name, Pro by Nature | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20y-q2OJBag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multi-format controllers are not a new idea. My 8Bit-Do Pro is my go-to for Switch and emulation but the Tarantula offers a few new tricks and has swiftly become my main choice for PC gaming. Opting for a Playstation layout with two parallel analogue sticks at the bottom of the controller, the Tarantula feels immediately familiar and comfortable in the hand. The sticks themselves are TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) ‚Äì an even more precise magnetic system than Hall Effect ‚Äì rather than the more widely used potentiometer system and feel far smoother and more responsive than the main console competitors. The huge advantage TMR has over traditional controllers is the lack of moving parts subject to drift ‚Äì a factor that is a real blight on both Xbox and Playstation pads. Alongside the sticks we have a mechanical D-pad that feels satisfying to use.</p>


<p>The default button layout for the Tarantula echoes the Xbox standard and even shares the colour coding system. However, one of the coolest options here is the ability to switch between controller profiles and adjust the button layout accordingly. Holding the mode button and the requisite face button operates the mechanism that changes the button layout to the alternative Switch standard. This mechanism is visible through a transparent section and is the kind of satisfying design that would have Alan Partridge purring.</p>


<p>Other than the transparent window revealing the gears that work the switch mechanism the controller has a dark camouflage pattern that is unobtrusive if a little underwhelming. There are RGB effects across the pad as well as the illuminated button layout but the colours and brightness of these are easily adjustable if you want a plainer controller. Aside from the main face buttons there are multiple programmable buttons that by default act as Start and Select (or the system equivalent). The increased options available through these buttons are an interesting addition but I didn‚Äôt really find myself using them that much.</p>
<p>More useful are the programmable back buttons that are becoming a more popular choice on controllers. Even better here is the fact that you can lock them using a physical switch and prevent them from being pressed accidentally. The increased functionality on the back of the pad continues with more physical switches that can adjust the triggers to be either analogue or microswitched. This is a really nice addition as it enables the controller to be quickly altered to suit different genres with the microswitches being perfect for shooters and action games whilst analogue better suited to driving games.</p>

<p>The Pro version that I‚Äôve been using also comes complete with a nifty charging stand that sits nicely on my gaming desk and keeps the pad ready for action. It can be connected via USB-C if preferred as well as offering both Bluetooth and dedicated dongle connection. I opted for the latter and have had no issues with latency or lag throughout my time using it.</p>
<p>So far so positive, and as mentioned earlier the Gamesir Tarantula is my new main PC controller but I did encounter some odd problems when trying it out on Switch. Initially connecting the controller didn‚Äôt work unless the Switch was in handheld mode ‚Äì a weird glitch as that is not really the ideal use case for a pad. Once the connection was made however it remained connected on the Switch mode and could be used without issue. I‚Äôve decided to carry on using my 8Bit-Do pad for Nintendo gaming but that‚Äôs more to do with my own addiction to multiple controllers than anything being particularly wrong with the Gamesir pad. The instructions link to a Gamesir app but this appeared to only be in Chinese and didn‚Äôt seem to include the pad under review at time of testing.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gamesir Tarantula Pro is a fantastic pad that can work across multiple devices and offers a comfortable and responsive option. The Playstation layout may prove to be a divisive choice but for those that prefer parallel controls this represents a perfect solution for PC, Switch and mobile gaming. Even without the many hidden tricks and programmable buttons, this pad comes highly recommended.	</p></div>

<p>Game Science‚Äôs CEO and founder, Yocar-Feng Ji, recently discussed Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Yocar-Feng Ji took to the Chinese social media platform, <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his dissatisfaction with Black Myth Wukong losing out on GOTY at TGA 2024. Feng Ji first spoke about how the award ceremony came along simultaneously with their ‚Äò<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively large update</a>‚Äò for the title and how this project has spanned 7 years. He then talks about how the game was nominated across four categories and won the Best Action Game and Players‚Äô Voice award, with the latter being more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji reveals that he had ‚Äúa sense of loss and regret‚Äù (as translated by ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PS5</a>) with Wukong not winning GOTY and states that the games nominated ‚Äúwere all exceptional‚Äù. However, he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt determine the criteria‚Äù for GOTY this year. Feng Ji said that he feels he came all the way to Los Angeles ‚Äúfor nothing‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji added that he was very confident about Black Myth Wukong winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024, so sure that he had written his acceptance speech ‚Äútwo years ago‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Black Myth Wukong has been a massive success for Game Science, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a> and breaking several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player records on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tarkov-event-rewards-players-with-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-coveted-item.1063113/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has started a new pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov, and it rewards players with one of the most coveted, cherished items in the game‚Äôs ecosystem: Kappa.</p>



<p>The Kappa secure container is one of the items that the game‚Äôs most die-hard fans aspire to unlock after every wipe (read: game reset). It takes a huge amount of effort to grab one, but after completing this relatively simple quest from Battlestate Games, you can get your hands on one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-temporary-greatness">Temporary Greatness</h2>



<p>The only drawback to this event is that you‚Äôll lose Kappa when the game wipes in the coming weeks ‚Äì but for those weeks, you‚Äôll feel like a legend. Typically, each new wipe brings around a ‚Äòrace to Kappa‚Äô, with many streamers participating to see who can unlock the aspirational item the fastest.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a beast of a task that requires collecting several rare items and completing dozens of in-game quests. The average player will never get within sniffing distance of Kappa before the game wipes, which is an event that takes place around once every six months.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-kappa-in-tarkov">How to Unlock Kappa in Tarkov</h3>



<p>To get Kappa, you‚Äôll need to complete the new ‚ÄòDark Times‚Äô quest, given to you by Fence, one of Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs traders.</p>



<p>Dark Times requires players to venture into Factory at night and kill 30 targets using nothing but a TOZ-16, one of the game‚Äôs most cumbersome and pointless weapons. That being said, if you put the right ammunition into it, there‚Äôs no reason why you couldn‚Äôt get this task done in just a few raids.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs worth stressing that you need to eliminate 30 <strong>targets</strong>, and not just PMCs. That means you can run in, blitz through fields of Scav enemies, and then hey presto, you‚Äôve unlocked Kappa for the remainder of the wipe.</p>



<p>Have fun while the secure container is in your possession ‚Äì it‚Äôll be gone soon. Perhaps the added stash space will motivate you to chase Kappa next wipe, who knows?</p>
