			<p>The Xbox handheld known as Project Keenan was teased with a not-subtle-at-all video that essentially confirmed who is making the yet-to-be-officially-announced system.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ASUS ROG Global official X profile shared a new video teasing something new that the company is working on. During the video, an ROG Ally is shown together with an Xbox controller, strongly hinting at the fact that ASUS is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">indeed</a> the company making the Xbox handheld reportedly launching this year. The Xbox X profile also added more fuel to the fire by reacting with a rather telling meme, so it seems like it's all but confirmed that ASUS is making the handheld.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/ONZpeEmNka">pic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka</a></p>
<p>— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Xbox handheld codenamed Project Keenan, which will look markedly Xbox with a similar design sensibility and will run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as some of its focuses, is only a small part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">Microsoft next-generation plans</a>, which will also include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a full-blown handheld that will launch in 2027. Microsoft's next-generation system will supposedly deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap</a> ever seen, so it will be very interesting to learn how this leap will be delivered and how future games will take advantage of it.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has called NieR: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry on its release.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html">AV Watch</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-he-was-ordered-not-to-worry-about-overseas-reviews-by-games-producer/">Automaton</a>), Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," said Yoshida.</p>

<p>The game proved Japanese studios could find success by creating Japanese-style games. "With NieR, everyone realised this," said Yoshida. "That it wasn't just something they could do, but something they had to do."</p>
<p>As such, Japanese studios strove to "create based on their own culture and what they knew", realising this was the appeal of their work overseas.</p>
<p>"I think that the Japanese game industry revived after NieR, so much so that you could talk about pre-NieR and post-NieR eras. Simply put, I think that was the title that made everyone want to pursue Japanese-style games," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>NieR creator Yoko Taro himself responded on social media, thanking Yoshida for the praise but crediting producer Yosuke Saito, who "ordered" him to make a game "that targets the Japanese market, without worrying about overseas reviews".</p>
<p>"Or, to put it more precisely," said Taro, "I remember being told something like 'Yoko, you can't make games for overseas, so (at least) try to make it for Japan'."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="ja"><p>なんか飛んできたので。オートマタを評価していただいているのは光栄ですが、「海外評価を気にせず日本向けに作れ」と命令したのは齊藤Ｐです。</p><p>もうちょっと正確に言うなら「ヨコオさんは海外向けにゲーム作るのは無理だから（せめて）日本向けに頑張ってくれ」的なことを言われたような記憶。 <a href="https://t.co/kOr2BwjFSs">https://t.co/kOr2BwjFSs</a></p></div>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1905991546828452080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Saito then replied: "What I said at the time went more like this: Since we're Japanese people, there's no need for us to go out of our way to cater to people overseas. Surely, we'll be able to attract at least a million players among all the people out there who genuinely want to play a Japanese game made by a Japanese person (the one and only Yoko Taro)."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-developers-join-forces-for-new-project-that-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">Saito teased a possible new NieR project</a> alongside Taro, though nothing further has been said since. "I've been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now," he said at the time. "I'll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. [Laughs] That's about all I can say for now."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-is-superior-to-nier-automata-says-yoko-taro">Taro also compared NieR: Automata to Stellar Blade</a>, stating: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is a really amazing game. I'd say that it's much better than NieR:Automata."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Have you played so much <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG</a> that you’ve developed… feelings for your favourite guns in the game? Well, lucky you, because Krafton has released a new dating sim for the month of April, called Winner Winner Romantic Dinner.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s an April Fools gag, but yes, it’s <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent">a real thing that you can play here</a>, so long as you don’t mind it using AI game development.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG | Winner Winner Romantic Dinner ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRIzm0f7cLQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The anime dating game has become a bit of a go-to gag, starting off with that game where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/10/kfc-date-colonel-sanders-a-finger-lickin-good-dating-simulator/">you can date Colonel Sanders of KFC fame</a>, and more recently, with the Dead By Daylight dating sim <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/03/dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-hooked-on-you-is-out-today/">Hooked On You</a>. Mixing this with PUBG is…. well, it’s amongst the weirdest, but maybe not quite.</p>
<p>Featured in the game are anime girlf-ified versions of the Molotov Cocktail – a fiery redhead, of course – AKM, AUG, and KAR98K. You’ll also, quite obviously, be attending school where you meet them.</p>

<p>This game has been created by Krafton’s AI game development studio ReLU Games, with generative AI used to create variations of character and background images. This is a pretty touchy subject between game developers and gamers right now. Krafton also encourage players to allow microphone access with voice recognition – if you play without mic access, mini-games will not be available.</p>
<p>If you reach one of the three game ending, you’ll receive a reward. These are 10&nbsp;<a title="Games > Contraband [20 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/contraband/">Contraband</a> Coupons to use within PUBG Battlegrounds, and an anime gun girl-themed nameplate. Reach all three and you can get a new spray, emblem and 500 G-Coin to spend in-game.</p>
<p>The game is available to play until 29th April.</p>
<p>There’s also a PUBG in-game event called Land, Love, Survive across PC and console. Running until 8th April at 2AM UTC, this pushes players toward co-op play with social and squad-based missions to reward&nbsp;Event Tokens, BP, Hunter’s Chests, Keys and Contraband Coupons. Find the details in-game.</p>

		<p>Exploring the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/runescape">RuneScape</a> universe in a completely new way, Jagex has revealed the co-op open world survival game RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The game is launching into Steam Early Access this spring, with a deep-dive reveal coming on 15th April.</p>
<p>By the way, this was actually announced on 31st March, so it’s definitely not an April Fools.</p>
<p><iframe title="RuneScape: Dragonwilds - Official World Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssbPDfS92o4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>RuneScape Dragonwilds will explore some rather familiar territory within games, with open world survival games having been a huge part of the indie gaming scene for quite a few years. Major hits like Valheim, Enshrouded and Grounded have set out the tone for this style of adventure, but Jagex is taking that template and putting a RuneScape twist on things, thematically and with the story that it’s looking to tell.</p>
<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds will head to the forgotten continent of Ashenfall, where dragons have now awoken. You’ll have to gather, build, craft and skill up in order to survive the lands, uncover some ancient secrets, and look to slay the Dragon Queen.</p>


<p>There’s some light RPG elements mixed with familiar RuneScape vernacular and lore for fans of the long-running MMO. That flavour includes things like using the power of Anima, summoning spectral axes to chop down trees and using nature’s energy to repair armour. The progression system. All of this can be played solo or with parties of up to four players.</p>
<p>Just as familiar to gamers is the game engine that Jagex has chosen to pull this off with. Instead of the rather distant top-down view of traditional RuneScape, the camera’s pulling right in on the characters and with that closeness, Jagex has chosen to adopt Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing RuneScape: Dragonwilds | Q&amp;A With Mod Dutch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30mkN1Hw83Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“We’re so excited to finally give players a glimpse at the next entry in the RuneScape franchise today with RuneScape: Dragonwilds,” said Jon Bellamy, Jagex CEO. “RuneScape: Dragonwilds is an entirely new RuneScapeexperience set within the iconic world of Gielinor and is a game which is worthy of wearing the RuneScape name.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of <em>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</em>. We’ve already conducted closed alpha tests with some of our closest community members, and we’ll be listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access. We’ve built an entirely new team filled with industry veterans who are focussed on making sure that <em>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</em>&nbsp; sits naturally within the <em>RuneScape</em>franchise, and a game that is loved by both our biggest <em>RuneScape</em> fans and entirely new players alike.”</p>
<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds is heading into Early Access this spring, with a full reveal set to come on 15th April at 5PM UK time.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> co-creator and programmer Tarn Adams has made fleeting, whimsical allusion to the possibility of an Elf Fortress game in a new interview - a fleeting, whimsical allusion I will now pounce on and make an enormous deal of, because my goodness, man, you can't just say "Elf Fortress" and walk off whistling into the sunset. 
</p>
<p>
The topic arose during a discussion of why fantasy dwarves are a "fortuitous" archetype for a maddeningly system-driven game like Dwarf Fortress, in which half the fun is enjoying the tunnel vision of characters who will cheerfully neglect their duties and doom their brethren because, for example, they're obsessed with crafting a mug that menaces with spikes of bituminous coal and alpaca wool. According to Adams, this is relatably "human", though he muddies things intriguingly by dropping a reference to androids, and allows players to weave stories around technical eccentricities and outright bugs, which can be read as instances of "dwarfy" fixation and excess. Elves? They don't work the same way. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/dwarf-fortress-dwarves-are-more-human-than-human-creator-says-theyre-allowed-to-embody-bigger-emotions-theyre-allowed-to-make-bigger-mistakes-theyre-allowed-to-do-anything/">a Parchment Gamer interview</a> at this year's Game Developer Conference, in which the Bay 12 co-founder reflects a little on the game's long development. "Dwarves turned out to be fortuitous, because they're sort of like - I don't know why it pops into my head - replicants from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>," Adams said. "More human than human. That's a dwarf."
</p>
<p>
Fantasy dwarves are "more human than human" because "they're allowed to embody bigger emotions," Adams went on. "They're allowed to make bigger mistakes. They're allowed to be stubborn. They're allowed to do anything." There's a kind of catharsis at work here, he said. "There's everything about it, from drunkenness to a very noble hubris. It's all there. Dwarves allow us to experience these different parts of ourselves that, in humanity, you might be more judgmental of." 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, "if you were playing an elf fortress, all of these stories would hit different," Adams said. "The antics they get up to, especially when it's a bit buggy or just being weird - I don't think elves would hit the same way. It'd be like 'What's going on with them?' Whereas with dwarves, you're like 'Nah, I know what's going on.'" The "devotion" of the dwarves supports the game's historically bloody-minded AI, he added, which has bred many internet legends of dwarves obstinately going about their duties while the fortress is being overrun.
</p>
<p>
"What are these AI agents but driven by the top need that has to be checked off right now? "Adams said later in the chat. "It feels right, even when it goes wrong, that they have that sense of devotion. It doesn't work for anything else quite the same way."
</p>
<p>
While I obviously defer to Adams's experience as the co-creator of by far the most elaborate manifestation of fantasy dwarfdom in video games, I can readily imagine a fortress or colony sim involving elves. I can imagine this partly because elves already exist in Dwarf Fortress. Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/g36l0w/no_mods_elf_fortress/">have even managed to create Elf Fortresses in-game</a> - admittedly, "culturally dwarvish" ones - by cultivating an influx of poets, allowing all the original dwarf residents to die off, and appointing an elf as baron. 
</p>
<p>
I can also imagine an Elf Fortress games because elves are themselves a set of well-entrenched literary archetypes and psychological metaphors. There's the Warhammer High Elf/Rivendell portrayal of elves as a declining, noble caste of immortals, rendered passive and complacent by their technological advantages and gifts of foresight - condescending in their benevolence toward the mortals. There's the contrasting depiction of elves as seductive, murderous bluebloods  found in Terry Pratchett's Lords And Ladies. There are the tree settlements and fey naturalism of wood elves in various stories. There's the association of elves with forbidden scholarship, demon flirtations, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
Plenty of material. Building a game of Dwarf Fortressy depth around the persona and associations of an elf would be a hard labour - likely, it would take the Adams brothers another few decades. I wouldn't wish that on them. But given the magnitude of their accomplishment with Dwarf Fortress, I'd be fascinated to see them try.

In 2025, finding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">Pokémon cards at their intended price</a> feels like spotting a shiny on the first encounter.

If you’re into Electric-types or just want an excuse to hear foil crackle between your fingers, I think this is it.

The Special Illustration Rare Pikachu ex is going for around $430, and Latias ex is even higher at nearly $500. Milotic ex is another banger at about $150 thanks to an ability that blocks damage from Tera Pokémon. Hydreigon ex is strong too, with a deck-discarding attack that’s super viable for play. Even the Hyper Rare Pikachu ex holds value at around $120. I don’t expect to pull any of these, but the odds keep things interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the kind of deal that’s perfect for casual collectors like me, or anyone who enjoys the chaos of pulling something rare right after saying, “Just one more pack.” I know better than to promise a Pikachu EX SIR in every box, but I’ll absolutely take my chances when I don’t have to pay a third-party markup for the privilege.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re building a deck, feeding a binder addiction, or just gifting this to a kid so you can secretly open the packs yourself later, this is your chance.

            <p>The official landing page for Ghost of Yōtei got a little update yesterday, with some new information on Sucker Punch's upcoming game tucked in there.</p>
<p>Straight off the bat, along with some more story details, the developer has remained committed to its 2025 release window on PS5. There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).</p>
<p>In terms of story, while we knew Ghost of Yōtei's protagonist Atsu had a revenge mission of some kind, we now have a little more background as to why.</p>

<p>Here's what the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/">updated Ghost of Yōtei synopsis reads</a>:</p>
<p>"300 years after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</p>
<p>"Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you."</p>
<p>Along with the fact we now know Atsu is seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, that mention of "every odd job and bounty" has also sparked some intrigue. It sounds like Ghost of Yōtei may include a bounty mechanic, and perhaps have some kind of in-game economy, which would spice up the game's world a touch.</p>
<p>The developer previously said it was going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei had a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities.</p>
<p>Back in October, Sucker Punch's creative director Jason Connell said: "One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yōtei was first unveiled at a PlayStation State of Play last year</a>.</p>
<p>"To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," wrote Sucker Punch communications manager Andrew Goldfarb at the time. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend.</p>
<p>"This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker.1150674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new rumor suggests that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake could be mere days from its announcement and launch. New leaker Detective Seeds <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906165593016799478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> (two days ago, so it's not an April Fools' joke) that the launch could come as soon as Thursday, April 3, or maybe next week, according to his source. Detective Seeds doesn't have a long track record, but he did get a couple of things right: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 release date of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM previews dropped yesterday</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906086027665490373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Ghost of Yotei might launch in July, by the way. We'll see if he's right about either of them.</p>
<p>As for the Oblivion remake, though, there are other sources pointing in that direction. Both proven insider NatetheHate and VideoGamesChronicle <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-unreal-engine-5-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-and-launched-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game would launch in April, with the former also adding that it could be shadow-dropped, meaning the announcement and launch would happen at the same time. It would, however, be a little surprising since Xbox has South of Midnight (out next week) and then the aforementioned PS5 debut of the Indiana Jones game.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake is said to be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology and developed by Virtuos. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous report from MP1st,</a> the remake will deliver enhancements in six main gameplay areas (other than the obvious visuals): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by the Soulslike genre and other modern action games. Sneak has also been overhauled and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system was tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should occur less often.</p>
<p>The HUD (Heads-Up Display) has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, Virtuos has improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing with the third or first person camera.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake comes in the same year as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a>, the long-awaited fan-made total conversion of The Elder Scrolls IV into the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. There should be enough adventures in Cyrodiil for everyone in 2025.</p>

But yesterday, developer Pocketpair released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpilXM6638">second trailer for the game</a> and published <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3620480%2FPalworld_More_Than_Just_Pals%2F" rel="sponsored">an official Steam listing</a>, so it seems like it’s a bit closer to actually releasing.</p><p>According to the Steam page, “You, the protagonist, enroll as a transfer student in the prestigious Palpagos Private Academy. You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It’s up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them.”</p><p><em>Pal♡world</em>’s initial trailer stated the game would release on an April 1st, 2025, but the newly launched Steam page says its release date is “to be announced.”</p><p><em>PUBG’s</em> dating sim, called “Winner Winner Romantic Dinner,” is an April Fools’ Day promotion that will let you get to know the game’s weapons as characters that have been personified.</p><p>“‘Winner Winner Romantic Dinner’ is set in a high school within the <em>PUBG</em> universe, where players take on the role of a student preparing for a school festival,” according to a press release. ”The game features characters inspired by PUBG’s iconic firearms, with branching storylines that lead to multiple unique endings.”</p><p>The <em>PUBG</em> dating sim will be available from April 1st to April 29th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-Hyeok is a rockstar in the esports world. He’s one of the most decorated competitors in history with multiple world championship titles under his belt, and he’s known as one of the most consistent players in the business. As a League of Legends star, Faker has racked up millions of dollars in earnings, and he’s using that fortune to remain charitable.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Faker joined a few other players in donating stacks of cash to support the Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association in South Korea.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first-time">Not The First Time</h2>



<p>Faker is a philanthropist as well as a gifted esports competitor.</p>



<p>In 2020, he donated 30 million Korean Won ($25,000) to COVID-19 charities, and in 2022, he followed that up with another 50 million KRW to similar agencies. In 2023, he donated $25,000 to the Community Chest of Korea, releasing the following statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I delivered donations to Community Chest of Korea again this year, to mark the year-end and New Year’s season, when warm helping hands are most needed. This was a meaningful year and I know my fans have done good deeds before me. I hope my donation can contribute to warming up the holiday season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, Faker has <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-society/2025/04/01/H3IPM6MFRFDJ3N57XY7JW2QRE4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extended a donation again</a>, giving 50 million KRW ($34,000) to support the delivery of emergency relief supplies in wildfire-affected areas in South Korea. His donation will be used to set up temporary shelters and help affected residents get back to their daily lives.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope this can help those affected by the wildfire. I wanted to lend support so that everyone can return to a stable daily life as soon as possible. I pray that no further damage occurs and that a swift recovery is achieved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his many years as an active League of Legends competitor, Faker has earned almost $2 million through esports tournaments, and once upon a time, it was rumoured that his salary exceeded $5 million. It’s heartwarming to see the superstar player giving back to his community in South Korea, where he’s respected as an athlete and gaming personality.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, the developer of the Payday series, has announced the appointment of a new CEO – Adolf Kristjansson. He’s an industry veteran who comes across from a role as senior director of global commercial strategy at Electronic Arts. In a statement, Kristjansson revealed his intentions to turn Starbreeze into a ‘multi-title studio’.</p>



<p>Last year, Tobias Sjögren, the former CEO of Starbreeze, stepped down following the paltry launch of Payday 3, a game that was plagued with issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-great-enthusiasm">‘Great Enthusiasm’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/adolf-kristjansson-appointed-as-new-ceo-of-starbreeze/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> following his appointment, former EA veteran Adolf Kristjansson said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I join Starbreeze with great enthusiasm for the company’s current and future projects, not the least the upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons title. I look forward to continuing the work of expanding the Payday franchise further and building Starbreeze into a true multi-title studio.</em></p>



<p><em>Most of all, I look forward to working closely with our talented teams and engaging with our passionate player community as we build the next chapter of Starbreeze together</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Chariman of the Board, Jürgen Goeldner said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>On behalf of the board I want to welcome Adolf to Starbreeze and I look forward to a long and fruitful cooperation. I also want to take the opportunity to thank Mats Juhl for his great contribution during his period as interim CEO</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The last couple of years have been nothing short of rocky for Starbreeze, which reported a full-year loss of almost $20 million in December 2024. Things have picked up since reparations were made in the game, and now that Payday 3 has been available for a stint on PS Plus, the player count has climbed a bit.</p>



<p>Could things be looking up for Starbreeze? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-creepy-lewd-mode-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed via a recent ESRB filing that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will feature the Peep Demo Theatre that was deeply hidden in the original 2004 release. This super-secret feature was unlocked after viewing every possible cutscene of the game in full, which meant going through several runs and unlocking all possible avenues of content.</p>



<p>With the Peep Demo Theatre, players unlocked an interactive, feature-length cutscene between Naked Snake and Eva ‘behind the waterfall’. It allows players to manipulate the camera at will, focusing on Eva’s breasts, butt, and body in general. It’s a lewd gimmick, and it’s back in Metal Gear Solid Delta.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wait-and-see">Wait and See</h2>



<p>It seems unlikely that a feature like this will be ‘accepted’ in this day and age, and I can see some folks trying to cancel MGSD over it, but it’s staying true to the original release that dropped when the world was a different place.</p>



<p>The recent filing from <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40362/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-esrb-rating-suggests-its-controversial-sexual-content-is-still-intact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) states:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is an action game in which players assume the role of an elite soldier trying to stop special forces behind enemy lines. From a third-person perspective, players infiltrate areas, complete missions, and take down enemy soldiers. Players use knives, pistols, machine guns, and explosives to kill enemies. Combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Some close-quarter combat allows players to slit enemies’ throats, resulting in large spurts of blood. </p>



<p>Cutscenes depict further instances of violence/blood: a restrained character beaten and electrocuted; a character shot in the eye; a character on fire shot several times. The game contains some suggestive/sexual content: a man groping a woman’s breasts; close-up cameras angles of deep cleavage; a character briefly groping a man’s crotch; <strong>a Peep Demo Theatre allowing players to view cutscenes of a female character’s body from a first-person perspective</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We knew about the violence, but few players even knew that the Peep Demo Theatre existed. Now that they <strong>do know</strong>, it’ll likely become a conquest for many to see how the new, high-resolution model of Eva looks in the Peep Demo Theatre.</p>



<p>Are you going to strive to unlock the Peep Demo Theatre in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p><strong>Season 03 will be released in Black Ops 6 on April 2 at 9 AM PT / 5 PM BST.</strong> Here are the key features of this monumental update.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-maps">New Multiplayer Maps</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Firing Range (6v6)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Firing Range makes its glorious return in Black Ops 6 in a faithful remaster of the fan-favorite map. Watch for crossfire down the long center Road as Operators fight for control of the vantage points in the Tower and the upper levels of the Shoot House and Garage. Shooting targets move back and forth on their tracks behind the Office and several other spots adding a useful diversion while preparing for the next fight. Avoid the center chaos by branching off to the Dirt Road, keeping your guard up against ambush as you pass the Storage unit along the way.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Barrage (6v6)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Revisit 1968 Vietnam as you follow Hudson’s clues surrounding one Summit Watch at the front lines of battle. The trees have been cleared and the landscape flattened to make room for this base housing an artillery battery in active combat. The area has taken hits with large chunks blown off buildings including the Command Center and Barracks, the damage opening new pathways through the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nomad (6v6, 2v2)</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Pantheon moles were in Afghanistan, too, when Woods fought there in 1986. Fight in the ruins of a fortified settlement commandeered for the ensuing battle, a parked missile carrier facing out over the valley where a convoy lies in ruins on the narrow road leading up to the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-modes">New Multiplayer Modes</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Sharpshooter</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Flex your skills in this classic Black Ops free for all party mode where every Operator is assigned the same Loadout which changes every 45 seconds. Each cycle introduces a new Primary and Secondary Weapon from scoped Sniper Rifles to akimbo Pistols, plus a new Dedicated Melee weapon and Tactical and Lethal Equipment.</li>



<li>Use everything at your disposal to eliminate enemies while unlocking bonus abilities for going on a streak:
<ul>
<li>1st Elimination: Increased movement speed.</li>



<li>2nd Elimination: Increased reload speed.</li>



<li>3rd Elimination: Increased sprint recovery speed.</li>



<li>4th Elimination: Increased ADS speed.</li>



<li>5th Elimination: Earn double score for eliminating enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Keep the streak going to unlock double score and make a run for the top three. When you’re taken out, respawn and build up those bonuses again. A short countdown precedes each weapon swap. Adapt and win.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Demolition</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Alternate between attacking and defending two bomb sites. The attacking team must destroy both bomb sites to win the round, gaining a time bonus after detonating the first site. All attacking Operators spawn with a bomb and respawns are active for both teams throughout the match.</li>



<li>Defense is all about running down the clock. Defuse planted bombs right away, as the match timer pauses whenever a bomb site is in active countdown. If one of the sites is destroyed, regroup and throw everything you have into defending the last one.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-weapons-in-black-ops-6-and-cod-zombies">New Weapons in Black Ops 6 and COD Zombies</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Kilo 141 – Assault Rifle (Call of Duty: Warzone Login Reward)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fully automatic assault rifle with an ergonomic design that improves handling, and a steady fire rate helps stay on target.</li>



<li>The Kilo 141 is back and ready to tear it up across Multiplayer and Call of Duty: Warzone. The weapon’s smooth handling, manageable recoil, and steady fire rate give it room to shine in a variety of combat situations, leaving no doubt as to why the Kilo 141 was a favorite in Verdansk. Now that the location is back, it’s time to relive the glory days with this hard-hitting Primary Weapon.</li>



<li>Players will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">automatically unlock the Kilo 141</a> for use in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone after logging in to Call of Duty: Warzone at the launch of Season 03.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>CR-56 – Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>This lightweight 7.62 x 39mm full-auto assault rifle is compact and powerful. Built exclusively for military use, the standard issue rifle is deadly at mid-range combat and easily configured for a variety of assault tactics.</li>



<li>Combining high-damage hits with a fast fire rate and good handling, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">the CR-56 AMAX</a> is the perfect mid-range weapon for downing targets fast. Eliminate enemies in three to four shots up to 25 meters out, leaving plenty left over to chew through equipped armor. Quick reloads get you back into the action fast, a helpful trait no matter how you choose to customize the weapon via Gunsmith.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>HDR – Sniper Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Anti-material bolt action sniper rifle chambered in 12.7 x 108mm ammunition. Bullets have a lower muzzle velocity but remain devastating even at very long ranges.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">Veterans of Verdansk know the power</a> of the HDR and the havoc a sniper can inflict with it when stationed in high vantage points like the infamous Airport Control Tower. The weapon’s long reach and heavy damage make it a favorite of sharpshooters, its distinctive firing sound sending squads running. Add the Reinforced Barrel attachment to further extend your damage range and bullet velocity, and don’t forget to hold your breath for difficult shots.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Kali Sticks – Melee (Event Reward)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two-hit kill. Extremely fast attack speed. Short range.</li>



<li>The infamous Kali Sticks return, dealing out damage with rapid swings that’ll take down your target in a flash. Smack them with fast follow-up hits using the weapon’s light attack or take them out in a more dramatic fashion by unleashing the heavy attack. Use Kali Sticks in Multiplayer with the new Close Shave Perk to deploy a quick whack against enemies without having to manually swap to your Dedicated Melee slot first.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nail Gun – Special (In-Season)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Full-auto Nail Gun. High damage at close range with fast handling speeds and very low muzzle velocity.</li>



<li>Stick it to them with this handy tool configured with a magazine of 15 nails that fires at full auto. The damage drops off quickly after 25 meters and performs best up close. The Nail Gun’s low muzzle velocity can make it difficult to land shots against fast moving targets, so get them in your sights and unload before they know what hit them. This armament is a reward earned during the Black Ops Tribute Event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-attachments-in-black-ops-6">New Attachments in Black Ops 6</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic Suppressor (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monolithic Core provides superior sound suppression and increased range. Moderate weight increase affects agility.</li>



<li>Available for Assault Rifles (except AS VAL), SMGs, Shotguns, LMGs, Marksman Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Pistols.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>SWAT 5.56 Grau Conversion (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Convert the SWAT 5.56 into a fully automatic weapon with lower damage and range but improved accuracy, mobility, and handling. Equips a new default Barrel and Magazine and unlocks an exclusive 50-round extended Magazine. Blocks Barrel attachments.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>C9 10mm Auto 30-Round Mags (In-Season)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conversion kit to use higher caliber 10mm Auto ammunition for increased stopping power. Though the conversion results in some increased recoil and a slightly lower fire rate, the extra damage, range, and velocity make this attachment a worthy consideration when approaching enemies on bigger maps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>There will also be <strong>one </strong>new multiplayer perk released at the launch of Season 03 – Close Shave. Another perk will follow – Vendetta – later in the season.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-scorestreak">New Scorestreak</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Death Machine (In-Season)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heavy minigun with a fast fire rate, high penetration, and a large ammunition capacity.</li>



<li>Wield the infamous Death Machine, a powerful weapon with a single large magazine that fires high-impact rounds at a blistering rate of fire. Score earned while using the Death Machine contributes to your current Scorestreak progress, making this a great tool for bumping up to the next streak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-cod-zombies-season-03-patch-notes">COD Zombies Season 03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Here’s the full spread of patch notes for Zombies in Season 03.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-zombies-map-shattered-veil">New Zombies Map – Shattered Veil</h3>



<p>With the Sentinel Artifact in hand, the crew heads to the remote wooded hills above Liberty Falls to meet with S.A.M. at an old mansion in the forest, which has been retrofitted to [[REDACTED]]. Only with the aid of S.A.M.’s synthetic mind can the team hope to unlock the ancient artifact’s mysteries and bring back Agent Maxis. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p>Here’s the latest trailer for the new COD Zombies map:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop multiple zombies at once with the upgraded and modestly unstable Ray Gun Mark II.

<li>Ray Gun Mark II-W: Offering similar bullet patterns to a submachine gun, this also has a random chance to ignite enemies.</li>



<li>Ray Gun Mark II-P: Shooting ammunition like a shotgun, with a chance to spawn a sigil with the ability to grant invulnerability to the player standing on it for a limited time.</li>



<li>Ray Gun Mark II-R: Dropping zombies with a Marksman Rifle-like discharge, expect a chance to spread a plague infection that can inflict area-of-effect damage.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Wunderwaffe DG-2</strong>
<ul>
<li>Capable of striking down hordes with chain-lightning blasts, this has the bonus effect of stunning crowds of zombies, usually resulting in additional, and eventually terminal damage.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-zombies-enemies">New Zombies Enemies</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Elder Disciple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Strange, floating apparitions have been seen flitting about the sprawling gardens and rambling mansion estate. Known to some as Elder Disciples, these powerful enemies likely spell trouble for the crew.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Elder Disciples gain strength as they empower the zombies around them while summoning more undead to join the battle. Using their dark magic, these fetid, floating carcasses can force their allies to evolve more quickly, allowing a lowly zombie to more rapidly transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form.</li>



<li>Eliminate the Elder Disciple before their forces grow too powerful, keeping it at a distance to avoid the scream it lets loose against players who draw too close. The deadly enemy grows more agitated as it takes damage, so try to get the job done fast.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Toxic Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>As a sickly yellow fog descends across the mansion, expect the inhabitants to take on an even-more revolting pallor. Easily identifiable due to their greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, Toxic Zombies seem to have lost all but their base perambulatory functions and seem intent on sprinting toward their prey before exploding, leaving a damaging pool of acid in their wake. Listen for their telltale shriek and get the jump on them before they can close the distance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-gobblegums">New GobbleGums</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical Diffusion (Rare)</strong>

</li>



<li><strong>Support Group (Legendary)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gobble up this tasty GobbleGum to acquire the ARC-XD, Mangler Cannon, Sentry Gun and Mutant Injection Support items.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Die Pitched (Whimsical)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zombies have high-pitched voices. Lasts three minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-global-updates-in-season-03">Global Updates in Season 03</h2>



<h3 id="h-console-cross-play-update">Console Cross-Play Update</h3>



<p>In Season 03, we’re giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p>



<p>Each of these three settings (Multiplayer Ranked Play, Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play, and Multiplayer Unranked) will include the following options:</p>



<ul>
<li>On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in the selected playlists.</li>



<li>On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in selected playlists.
<ul>
<li><em>May negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Off: Restricts matchmaking to your current gaming platform only in selected playlists.
<ul>
<li><em>Will negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional details on how these settings interact with party members who are on different platforms.</p>



<ul>
<li>Players in a party who all belong to the same console platform will matchmake with the party leader’s preferred cross-play settings.</li>



<li>Players who have selected “Cross-Play Off” and create a mixed platform party that includes a different console platform will have their cross-play settings temporarily adjusted to “Cross-Play On (Consoles Only)” to enable matchmaking. This temporary adjustment enables matchmaking for the duration of the mixed platform party, and disbanding this party will result in preferred matchmaking settings being restored.</li>



<li>Players who have selected “Cross-Play Off” and create a mixed platform party with a PC player will have their cross-play settings temporarily adjusted to “Cross-Play On.” This enables matchmaking for the duration of the mixed platform party, and disbanding this party will result in preferred matchmaking settings being restored.</li>



<li>Reminder: Adjusting Cross-Play settings may negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-blackcell-challenges">New Blackcell Challenges</h3>

<h3 id="h-warzone-battle-pass-season-03">Warzone Battle Pass Season 03</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Memories are a powerful tool, and even the departed can change the course of history. The road back to Verdansk involves unlocking some core memories, as well as some unforgettable weaponry and new Operators. A flashback to agent Jason Hudson, bringing echoes of his frontline savvy, Hudson is unlockable by progressing within the Battle Pass. Joining him is Mace, the metal-faced mercenary, who will bring the war anywhere, anytime, for anyone, unlocked instantly upon Battle Pass purchase.</p>



<p>The Season 03 Battle Pass includes over 110 pieces of unlockable content (excluding BlackCell) including free, earnable armaments; two new Base Weapons, the Monolithic Suppressor Attachment, and more. Check out the BlackCell, Battle Pass and Store Bundles blog prior to Season 03 launch for a closer look at what’s coming.</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-customisation-and-blueprints">Weapon Customisation and Blueprints</h3>

<li><strong>Weapon &amp; Blueprint Customization</strong>

<ul>
<li>For Base Weapons, you can only change the skin of the Base Weapon, not any Attachments.</li>



<li>For Blueprints, you can customize the skins with other existing Attachments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-return-to-verdansk-event-roadmap">Return to Verdansk Event Roadmap</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Welcome back to Verdansk!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celebrate Verdansk’s return by logging into Call of Duty: Warzone from April 3rd to 15th to earn up to 20 rewards including six instant unlocks and the Kali Sticks Melee Weapon.</p>



<p>Open safes in various locations to secure rewards, such as the exclusive “Trail Blazer” Operator Skin for Caine. You may even get especially lucky during your search!</p>



<p>Be sure to log in to instantly unlock the Kilo 141 and two Operator Skins. Original Verdansk veterans also get bonus items: the “Blue Legacy” Contrails, “Coming Home” Parachute, and “Like We Never Left” Gun Screen.</p>



<ul>
<li>Welcome Home: Verdansk has returned! The map that started it all in Call of Duty: Warzone – including a breadth of classic and memorable features that naturally come with it.</li>



<li>Below is a recap of some of the improvements made to Verdansk that players can expect to see – as outlined in the Return to Verdansk blog:
<ul>
<li>Trees slightly repositioned from the original map.</li>



<li>Non-drivable vehicles clearly marked as smoldering wreckage.</li>



<li>Swimming now possible – southern coastline expanded into Kastovian Sea (not critical to gameplay).</li>



<li>Improved traversal in steep areas – new “goat trails” added.</li>



<li>Shorter telephone/electrical poles for easier parachute landings.</li>



<li>Additional ladders and adjusted paths to rooftops for better accessibility.</li>



<li>Doors now double-hinged, allowing barging, shooting, or blowing open/closed.</li>



<li>Ascenders returning mid-season, already available in Plunder mode; updated to faster “L” shape design for increased fluidity and speed when getting on and off</li>



<li>Enhanced exterior lighting, improved visibility, and reduced glare.</li>



<li>Interior lighting adjusted to reduce hiding spots, especially against dark corners.</li>



<li>Added detail enhancements, such as extra debris and scenery around Fire Stations and riverbanks.</li>



<li>And for console players, the ability to view Verdansk in up to 120 FOV for the first time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gulag Showers</strong>
<ul>
<li>The original Gulag from 2020 is back, with all three variants included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gulag Overtime: Capture the Flag (CTF)</strong>
<ul>
<li>When Gulag match-ups don’t resolve fast enough, a flag will spawn in the middle of the arena. The winning player is the one that either dispatches their rival as normal or captures the flag within the time limit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Rebirth Island Resurgence will remain in the map pool in Season 03.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-mode-battle-royale-casual">New Mode – Battle Royale Casual</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Battle Royale Casual&nbsp;</strong><em>At Launch</em>
<ul>
<li>The Battle Royale experience is branching out with the introduction of a new mode featuring bot players. This is designed as a stepping stone for players to go from the Warzone Bootcamp tutorial mode to an experience closer to our traditional, player-only, experience. Players can learn the game and hone their skills in a lower-stress environment while still embracing the core survival challenge of being the last squad standing among 148 players.</li>

<li><strong>Plunder</strong><em>At Launch</em>

<h3 id="h-full-verdansk-refresh-details">Full Verdansk Refresh Details</h3>



<div><p>The return to Verdansk comes with some refinements to Battle Royale’s loot philosophy that brings us back to its roots: life is valuable, adaptability is key, great loot must be earned, and contracts are central to earning cash.</p><p>In order to create more intentionality around looting, the various sources of loot have been adjusted to be more reminiscent of the classic Verdansk days, with some improvements.</p></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ground Loot Refresh</strong>
<ul>
<li>Common to Epic weapons now sport a selection of random attachments that align with the weapon’s natural strengths.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Legendary weapons come with a variety of fixed builds tailored to specific roles, that are randomly selected match over match.&nbsp;</li>



<li>This change aims to maintain the excitement of random loot while preserving the reliability of weapon performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>High Value Loot Zones</strong>
<ul>
<li>This season, HVLZs remain consistent every match, allowing players to reliably identify Hospital, Military Base, and Superstore as Points of Interest (POIs) with enhanced ground loot and an increased number of Supply Boxes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Further enhancements to this feature will be added in future updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Supply Boxes</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic</strong>
<ul>
<li>These boxes provide consistent cash rewards and average to high-quality weapons, occasionally offering premium equipment such as legendary weapons, killstreaks, and gas masks.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Legendary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Legendary Supply Boxes have received significant upgrades for a more rewarding experience. These boxes guarantee top-tier weapons and some of the best loot available, with increased chances of obtaining substantial cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Reusable</strong>
<ul>
<li>These boxes replenish every 90 seconds, serving as an ideal means for players to regain strength in the mid-to-late stages of a match, particularly after returning from the Gulag or redeployment. They supply players with a viable weapon, an armor plate, and some cash to return to combat readiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Duffel Bags, Medical Cabinets, &amp; Weapon Lockers</strong>
<ul>
<li>These sources of loot have been removed to better service the classic feeling of Verdansk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Second Chance Mechanics</strong>
<ul>
<li>The following items have been removed from loot:
<ul>
<li>Gulag Tokens</li>



<li>Reinforcement Flares</li>



<li>Redeploy Tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The only available methods to return after death are:
<ul>
<li>Gulag Victories</li>



<li>Buy Station Buybacks</li>



<li>Jail Break Public Events</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Revive Kit</strong>
<ul>
<li>Self-revives can only be acquired via the following sources:
<ul>
<li>Legendary Supply Boxes → Random drop</li>



<li>Scavenger Contract → Random drop</li>



<li>Buy Station → $4,000</li>



<li>Fire Sale → Free</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Angle</strong>
<ul>
<li>Interactions now require more precise aiming to reduce accidental item pickups, resolving most unintended looting situations, such as inadvertently picking up items during reloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity Outlines</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rarity outlines now gradually fade into view only when players are within a logical proximity rather than remaining visible at all distances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Card Positioning</strong>
<ul>
<li>Loot cards are now centered over items to improve readability, particularly when combined with floating loot.</li>



<li>Loot cards remain at a fixed height rather than moving with the player’s view.</li>



<li>Loot cards are hidden when players sprint, dive, slide, or use lethals, tacticals, and field upgrades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-movement-mechanics-in-verdansk">New Movement Mechanics in Verdansk</h3>



<div><p>The introduction of Black Ops 6’s omni-movement system revolutionized gameplay and has become the foundation of player movement in Call of Duty: Warzone. While the system launched with multiplayer-inspired values, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-3-returns-to-verdansk-with-new-movement-changes/">we’ve recognized the need for adjustments</a> to better align movement dynamics with the unique demands of Call of Duty: Warzone’s limited-life modes.</p><p>Season 03 focuses on fine-tuning the Black Ops 6 player movement by ensuring a balance between fluidity and responsiveness. The adjustments to the movement mechanics are as follows:</p></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Movement Speed</strong>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Omni-sprint Side &amp; Back Speed Scaling&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced by 8.5%, to better balance strafe movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Slide Friction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increased by 4% to reduce overly slippery engagements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-warzone-contracts-in-verdansk">Warzone Contracts in Verdansk</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recon Contract</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the Intel contract, the Recon Contract provides players with a 4-minute timeframe to capture a designated domination point.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Rewards for completion include cash and a preview of the next circle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Supply Run</strong>
<ul>
<li>The much-loved “Supply Run” Contract returns! Players have 2 minutes to reach a designated Buy Station to earn rewards, which include cash and a single-item Fire Sale for each squad member at the targeted Buy Station.</li>



<li>Supply Run contracts will not appear on the map until the first circle has fully collapsed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Contract Multiplier</strong>
<ul>
<li>Returning from the Verdansk era, the contract multiplier enhances cash rewards as players complete more contracts.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Each contract completed now grants a +30% cash bonus, stacking up to a maximum of +150% additional cash rewards in both Battle Royale and Resurgence modes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-warzone-ranked-play-season-03-update">Warzone Ranked Play Season 03 Update</h2>



<p>Now that Season 02 has officially wrapped up, Ranked Play will be temporarily offline during the first half of Season 03. This downtime will give players a much-awaited opportunity to rediscover and relearn Verdansk before diving back into the competition.</p>



<p>We plan to bring Ranked Play back online with the Season 03 Reloaded update. Upon its return, all player ranks will undergo a full reset to Bronze, offering everyone equal footing and the excitement to climb back up through the ranks. When Season 04 arrives, we’ll resume the standard soft reset, pulling players back by only a few ranks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for your patience during this transition period – now go drop into Verdansk and have fun!</p>



<p><strong>That’s everything you could ever want to know about the Season 03 patch notes! Happy hunting.</strong></p>

<p>When it peaked, Warzone was the most popular battle royale game in the world. In the years that followed, the genre wavered slightly, and Warzone took a bit of a nosedive in terms of the overall player count. Verdansk might be back, but players are still concerned it won’t be enough, prompting them to ask, ‘When is Warzone going offline?’</p>



<p>It’s a fair question – if the game isn’t successful for long enough, it’ll be dropped by Activision as it’ll become a bit of a money sink. If you’ve been wondering when Warzone is going offline, read on.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-is-warzone-offline">Why is Warzone Offline?</h2>



<p>Let’s clear something up straight off the bat.</p>



<p><strong>Warzone is going offline between 9 AM PT on April 2 and 9 AM PT on April 3.</strong> If you try to access Warzone in that 24-hour window, you’ll be unsuccessful. This is because Activision’s teams will be busy altering the game immeasurably and bringing back Verdansk.</p>



<p>If you’ve tried to log in and have found that Warzone is down <strong>right now</strong>, it’s probably because of that.</p>



<p>Are you looking for a PST to BST conversion, British Call of Duty fans?</p>



<p><strong>Warzone will be offline between 5 PM BST on April 2 and 5 PM BST on April 3</strong>. Aren’t I considerate?</p>



<h2 id="h-are-warzone-servers-offline">Are Warzone Servers Offline?</h2>



<p>If you want to check whether the Warzone servers are down, you can check the <a href="https://support.activision.com/onlineservices">Call of Duty status page</a> hosted by Activision. This is the quickest way to check the Warzone server status.</p>



<p>Failing that, you can check social media. If there’s a problem, it’ll surface on platforms like Reddit and Twitter (X) quickly enough.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-play-when-warzone-is-offline">What to Play When Warzone is Offline</h2>



<p>If you’re hurting for some Call of Duty action while Warzone is offline between April 2 – 3, you can jump onto Black Ops 6, which will be undergoing a 24-hour freeplay window.</p>



<p>In this 24-hour window, you’ll be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">unlock the Kilo 141</a>, one of the most popular Warzone weapons <strong>ever</strong>, and from there, you’ll be free to grind it to level it up in the game’s multiplayer playlists.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-new-warzone-map-come-out">When Does The New Warzone Map Come Out?</h2>



<p>The ‘new’ Warzone map, which is a re-release of Verdansk, will come out on April 3 at 9 AM PT / 5 PM BST.</p>



<p>Verdansk hasn’t been seen in Warzone since December 2021, and fans have been eager to get back to it since it was removed from the map rotation. It has been recreated from the ground up by Activision’s teams, and it looks fantastic at first blush.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been adjusted, retro weapons have been added into the pool, and some of the most popular contracts and other features have been brought back <strong>just for Verdansk</strong>.</p>



<p>What a time to be a Call of Duty: Warzone fan.</p>



<p>Let me know what you’re looking forward to most about Verdansk in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-console-players-switch-off-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-console-players-can-finally-switch-off-crossplay.1150617/</guid>

<p>One of the most asked-for changes to Call of Duty Warzone arrives with Season 03, which drops tomorrow, April 2. In this long-awaited update, console-based Warzone players will <strong>finally </strong>be able to switch off crossplay functionality in regular multiplayer matchmaking.</p>



<p>That means that they can remove any chance of connecting with PC players, which eradicates a fair portion of the user base that engages in nefarious practices like <strong>cheating</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> breaking down the Season 03 patch notes, it was confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 03, we’re giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that console players will be able to <strong>switch off crossplay in Warzone </strong>for regular multiplayer matches.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-warzone">How to Turn Off Crossplay in Warzone</h3>



<p>To switch off crossplay in Warzone on console, you’ll need to navigate to the network settings menu and select ‘Cross-Play Off’. This will lock your selection unless the following happens:</p>



<ul>
<li>If you play with a mixed-platform party, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‘Cross-Play On’</li>



<li>If you play with at least <strong>one </strong>PC player, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‘Cross-Play On’</li>
</ul>



<p>Once your party returns to a single platform, your settings will automatically update to reflect your original choice.</p>



<p>Activision has warned that locking your matchmaking mechanics to a single platform might negatively impact your queue times, but that’s a small price to pay for feeling a little safer while playing Warzone on console.</p>



<h3 id="h-when-does-the-new-warzone-map-come-out">When Does The New Warzone Map Come Out?</h3>



<p>If you’re eager to switch off crossplay and dive into Verdansk, the new Warzone map, you don’t have long to wait. It’ll drop in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 at 9 am PST / 5 pm BST.</p>



<p>It has been several years since Verdansk was last in Warzone, and it’s expected to be a resurgence of sorts (no pun intended) for the popular battle royale map.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> how much of a W this crossplay decision is.</p>

<p>It was recently discovered that one of the most popular Warzone emotes is returning with the Season 03 update. It’ll be tucked into the battle pass, so you’re guaranteed to unlock it if you play enough. If you were around during the peak of Warzone when Verdansk first existed, you’ll recognise how humorous this emote can be.</p>



<p>That’s right – <strong>the middle finger emote is coming back to Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>But there’s a catch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crank-job">Crank Job</h2>



<p>The ‘Crank Job’ middle finger emote was a fan-favourite when it first emerged in Warzone. It allowed players to rebel against their opponents one last time as they lay bleeding out on the floor. It was great fun when fused with killcams, which is why it rapidly became one of the most popular emotes in the game.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the middle finger emote will return to Warzone in the Season 03 battle pass.</p>



<p>There’s a catch, unfortunately. </p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s a third-person variant of the Crank Job emote, which might eradicate any sense of whimsy attached to popping it once you’ve downed an enemy. I’m willing to hold out hope that it’ll be as funny as ever, but the third-person aspect might have ruined it a bit.</p>



<p>Here’s what everyone’s favourite Warzone emote used to look like:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A 3rd Person Version of the ‘Middle Finger’ Emote is RETURNING in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a><span> Warzone Season 3 Battlepass 😭 </span></p></article></div>







<p>There will be plenty more to unlock in the Season 03 battle pass in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/">a new Roze skin</a>, the AMAX, and the HDR sniper rifle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an excellent report on The Wrap revealed that</a>, despite initially walking back its decision, Warner Bros. is indeed intent on throwing <em>Coyote vs Acme</em>--a funded, shot and completed motion picture--in the trash. Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.</p><p>It's not the first time this has happened recently--"content" ranging<a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Disney TV shows</a> to a <em>Batgirl </em>movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more. Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was one thing, and <em>Batgirl</em><a href="https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text='Batgirl'%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&amp;text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20'Batgirl'%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>was reportedly also very bad</a>, which was another.</p><p>But <em>Coyote vs Acme</em> has been seen by <em>nobody</em>. The movie--directed by Dave Green, written by <em>May December's</em> Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.' entire existence--was paid for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.</p><p>It's an incredibly dystopian situation we all find ourselves in, where art is only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it's one<a href="https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that's been covered extensively elsewhere</a>, so I'm not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the decision here.</p><p>What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it's your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it's too late. If Warner Bros. don't want to release it, and have reportedly blocked attempts for other companies to release it, then what does it matter?</p><p>(<strong>Please note</strong>: I am not a lawyer or law enforcement officer and this does not constitute actual advice).</p><p>As we <em>have </em>covered previously,<a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there is no piracy without ownership</a>. If we can't buy or rent the thing, and likely never will be able to do so via legal means, then leaking this movie and putting it on torrent sites shouldn't be seen as stealing, either. By all accounts Warner CEO David Zaslav is happy throwing this movie in the bin, without selling a single theatre ticket or digital rental, so whether we get to see it for free or not doesn't move that financial needle one bit.</p><p>What leaking the movie <em>would </em>do is save a piece of art that hundreds of people poured their hearts and souls into for months or even <em>years</em>. That shouldn't be a crime. That's public service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UPDATE 9:45pm ET, March 31, 2025</strong>: <em>Stand down everyone.

<p>It’s no April Fool’s Day joke: Valve has dropped their latest Counter-Strike 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/529842339955343453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> on March 31st, featuring a handful of new weapon skins and a “clean up” Inferno and Train. It’s no brand new operation, but it’s a pretty sizable update to CS2 compared to others.</p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-march-31st-update-new-changes">Counter-Strike 2 March 31st Update – New Changes</h2>



<p>The CS2 weekly care package feature now includes three new weapon collections added to the drop list: Ascent, Boreal, and Radiant. The new collections have added “over 70 new [weapon] finishes,” featuring a wide variety of styles. It doesn’t appear that players will get to choose which weapon collection their weekly care package skin comes from, but it does increase the variety of skins that appear.</p>



<p>New skins aren’t exclusive to just the weekly care package for this update. A new case and a new weapon skin collection have been added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-the-armory-update-charms-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Armory</a>. Players can acquire the Fever case from the Armory page for two credits. By purchasing a Fever case key, players can open their case for a chance at the AWP Printstream or get extremely lucky and open one of several Shattered Web knives in Chroma finishes. Players can also spend four Armory credits to get one random skin from the new Train collection. The “limited edition” item has also been swapped out, and players can save 15 credits for one of the XM1014 Solitude variants. This items will be removed from the Armory on Sunday, July 13.</p>

<p>As for gameplay changes, Inferno and Train and have been hit with some “spring cleaning.” Both maps now feature some “cleaner surfaces, less clutter,” and a noticeably wider Banana section (B Main area) on Inferno specifically.</p>
