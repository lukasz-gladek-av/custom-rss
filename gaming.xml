<p>2024 was nothing short of a disaster for Ubisoft. In fact, it’s safe to say that it’s had a rough few years. Ubisoft stock has fallen from its February 2021 high of €84.60 to a mere €12.53 at the time of writing. That’s a massive 85% reduction in stock price from its all-time high. To put things into perspective, if you invested $1000 into Ubisoft during its peak, you’d now only be left with $150.</p>



<p>So far, its current fiscal year hasn’t been great either and has seen poor financial results attributed to games missing internal expectations, increased development costs, game cancellations, and delays. The years of mismanagement, overspending, and generally just being out of touch with the gaming sphere have led Ubisoft to a crossroads. Unfortunately, it’ll ultimately be the developers that suffer the consequences, and with Ubisoft’s future seemingly hanging in the balance of just one AAA game, that being Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we might not have to wait long to see how things shake out.</p>



<h2 id="h-buy-out-talks">Buy Out Talks</h2>



<p>It’s been widely reported that Ubisoft is currently in talks with advisors about ways to stabilize the business, with the most recent reports suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-buyout-talks-continue-as-stock-trading-temporarily-halted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tencent was set to buy out the company and take it private</a>. Those talks seem to have stopped, as a significant term in negotiations revolved around the Guillemot brothers’ insistence on retaining control, which is likely a term that Tencent probably wouldn’t want to agree to. After all, the Guillemot brothers essentially put Ubisoft in this predicament in the first place.</p>



<p>For now, the negotiation halt seems to be a strategy both sides are playing. Tencent will continue to snap up shares and raise its stake. At the same time, the Guillemot brothers will want to wait until late February to early March to reignite negotiations, as Ubisoft is set to release the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14</a>. An Assassin’s Creed Shadows failure gives Tencent more opportunities to increase its stake at a lower share value. Conversely, a successful launch gives the Guillemot brothers more negotiating power to head into further talks.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It seems that, at least by my own sources, the move could favor the Guillemot brothers more. By all accounts from various Ubisoft sources, pre-orders for the game were high before the game’s delay and are still looking strong, but expectedly still behind that of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (which was released on both past and current generation consoles at the time). Assassin’s Creed Shadows seems to be Ubisoft’s last major lifeline, and even if the game is a tremendous success, it doesn’t necessarily mean Ubisoft is out of the woods.</p>



<h2 id="h-mismanagement-hell">Mismanagement Hell</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and mismanagement go hand-in-hand; you can’t have one without the other. Over the past few years, I’ve reported on countless projects that have faced mismanagement issues, and it seems that it’ll never change at face value. For the most part, it comes down to upper management’s personal friendships and family, with one looking out for another at the expense of thousands of frustrated developers.</p>



<p>The most public projects that have struggled are the likes of Ubisoft’s self-proclaimed AAAA title Skull &amp; Bones and Beyond Good and Evil 2, with the latter still not having a public release date despite being announced 16 years ago. But beyond the more prominent titles, the mismanagement at the company has led to countless projects being canceled or in a confusing stage of development without any end in sight. One notable game, codenamed Project U, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to the drawing board after five years of development</a> and saw its budget balloon in size. One developer who worked on the project said they wouldn’t be surprised if it already exploded past the $100M mark.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>, one of the most promising free-to-play shooters at Ubisoft, and to be honest, in the entire industry over the past decade, released half-baked thanks to the same fate of mismanagement and higher-ups only looking out for themselves. After the game’s initially impressive numbers, developers told me that the writing was on the wall for months and that it would eventually close due to the massive drop-off and lack of player spending. &nbsp;The game was losing several million dollars in development costs alone — and that’s without the initial development costs, servers, and more on top — a cost that Ubisoft couldn’t afford in its current state, nor see a future where it could become a profitable title due to its own doing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the end, Ubisoft’s mismanagement presents a serious challenge for the company moving forward. Despite Ubisoft’s board launching an investigation into the company’s struggles (of which 5 members are from the Guillemot family, by the way), no one, at least to those I’ve talked to, believes it will lead to any change. Speaking with past and current Ubisoft employees at various levels in the company, it’s widely speculated that CEO Yves Guillemot would rather go down with the [Skull &amp; Bones] ship rather than give up his position with a similar sentiment reflected about the other Guillemot brothers. It’s a hurdle the company will somehow need to overcome wherever Assassin’s Creed Shadows lands, even if it’s a success.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s latest annual internal survey, which allows employees to somewhat anonymously (I say this because departments and studios are not anonymous) give feedback to the company, shows that employee trust in the company is staggeringly low. While I do not have an exact number for the entire company, some studios had an overall company trust level as low as 15-20% (purposely being vague here).</p>



<h2 id="h-an-uncertain-future">An Uncertain Future</h2>



<p>It feels somewhat inevitable that at some point during 2025, Ubisoft will change in a big way. Going private seems the likely way forward, but that decision will undoubtedly affect thousands of developers.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ubisoft could try and simply ride out the storm, especially if Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the way they hope, but the company needs to streamline the number of projects it’s working on. It needs to earn players’ trust back, starting with Shadows; and it needs to continue building that trust again, first, by stopping the constant chasing of trends.</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently has some big hitters in development and set to release by the end of 2026, including Splinter Cell Remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Hexe</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost Recon Over</a>, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and a few other smaller projects under big IP names. The Division 3, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rayman Remake</a>, another Assassin’s Creed Remake codenamed Stardust, another flagship Assassin’s Creed RPG, and Beyond Good and Evil 2 (which is now progressing well) are further out.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Yet, on the flip side, Ubisoft continues pumping money into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-project-u-gameplay-details-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U</a>, Project Scout (another Battle Royale heavily inspired by Apex Legends), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Maverick</a> (a Far Cry extraction-based shooter), NFT games, and several more titles that almost everyone with common sense will say is not going to provide a return on investment. To be clear, I’m not saying that Ubisoft needs to stop trying “new” ideas (the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing-inspired ALTERRA in development at Ubisoft</a> looks phenomenal in my opinion), but some projects are so blatantly destined to fail, that it’s mind-boggling that the company continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that they don’t have, on projects in the hopes that they are the next Fortnite.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is undoubtedly at a crossroads. However it goes, change has to happen at the top for it to succeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The Golden Needle, how I loathe you. Credit: LocalThunk</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Balatro</em> and I had come to an agreement. I was only allowed to interact with it under certain conditions. I was almost free of its grasp again when I hit the cruelest scenario of all: Golden Needle.&nbsp; I was trapped in a prison of my own creation until I found a way to win.</p><p>Some context: I had previously banished <em>Balatro</em> from my personal computer. If it’s on there, like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> work just doesn’t get done</a>. I knew instinctively that the mobile version was going to be far more insidious, and largely resisted its call until I had a six-hour Thanksgiving train ride to my parents I needed to kill. So I allowed it back into my system under the condition that I delete it immediately from my phone after the holiday was over.&nbsp;</p><p>This arrangement largely worked until I tried to reinstall the game for a Christmas train ride and found out that cloud saves were nonfunctional for a huge portion of users on iOS. This is a huge issue and you will see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fq287j/careful_with_cloud_save/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tons of pissed off reddit threads on the topic</a>. All that progress I had previously was gone. Lucky, the developers were smart enough to include an option in the menu that lets you just unlock everything. The problem with that is that I am goal oriented when playing <em>Balatro</em>, and with nothing to unlock I decided to go after the 20 “challenges,” custom scenarios built into a special mode in the game.</p><p>Most of the challenges in <em>Balatro</em> are fun and fairly straightforward. The Rich Get Richer starts you off with $100 and vouchers that max out your interest, but limits your scorable chips to the amount of money you have. Medusa gives you a single, indestructible <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Marble_Joker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marble Joker</a>, which rapidly fills your deck with stone cards. Fragile gives you a deck of entirely glass cards and gives you <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Oops!_All_6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two jokers that double all probabilities</a>, which makes glass cards break every time. Each of these scenarios forces the player to work around the limitations of their deck and often upend how the game is played.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges are fair for the most part until you get to the last three and the difficulty skyrockets tremendously. Cruelty forces you to operate at a disadvantage – small blinds and big blinds give no reward money. This sucks but is very reliably beatable. Jokerless forces the player to operate without jokers. This also sucks, but there are ways to get to the end without jokers – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bx1jhf/comment/kyae510/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building on four of a kind or straights, which scale more aggressively</a>. Of the three, Golden Needle is the cruelest.</p><p>Golden Needle<em> </em>starts you off with a <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Credit_Card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Card</a> joker and $10, allowing you to go -$20 in debt. Each used discard costs you $1. You have six discards a round, and can only play one hand each round. Welcome to hell.</p><figure><figcaption>These Jokers all become far more powerful in Golden Needle. Credit: Localthunk </figcaption></figure><p>What makes Golden Needle<em> </em>so frustrating is that it is the scenario most dependent on random chance. You get past the first round by aggressively cycling through one of the few hands that can beat it – usually a high end straight, flush or full house. What you pull in the first shop determines how you must proceed, if you can at all.</p><p>Golden Needle also subtly changes the way you play the game. Certain MVP jokers that would carry you through the game, jokers that get stronger each hand like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ride_the_Bus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ride The Bus</a> or <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Spare_Trousers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spare Trousers</a>, do not scale fast enough to account for the scenario. Conversely, other jokers that shine in a scenario with one hand and six discards become elevated in importance – jokers like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat </a>(which gives you a 3x multiplier on the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dusk</a> (retriggers the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Cream</a> (which gives you a massive chip bump but reduces every hand played) and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Castle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castle </a>(gains +3 chips every time a specific suit is discarded).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Oh COME ON. Credit: Localthunk.</figcaption></figure><p>The constant financial drain of discarding means maintaining a functioning economy becomes twice as hard, and you are forced to take a risk to pull yourself out of debt, or function exclusively in the negative. On top of this, certain <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blinds_and_Antes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss blinds</a> like The Mouth or The Needle become irrelevant, while others like The Water will destroy you outright. This unique combination of pure chance and elevated strategy mean that you not only have to be lucky, you also have to be good. Every round played is on a knife’s edge. One move and you are done.</p><figure><figcaption>Here's what worked. Flushes. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>That’s where I was for days: refusing to delete <em>Balatro</em> until I bested Golden Needle. Through a series of convoluted circumstances I engineered a prison of gaming that I could technically leave but refused to out of pride. I have gotten to the final round multiple times, only to come up short by inches. And this morning, as I was writing this, it finally happened. A combination of the <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Banner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banner</a>, <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat</a> and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Onyx_Agate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onyx Agate</a> while focusing on juicing flushes (which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bbh75a/how_to_win_chips_and_influence_mult_a_thorough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normally a bad idea</a> but far more viable due to the number of discards in this specific scenario) carried me through to Ante 8. The joy I felt was sublime.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm finally free. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>I love and hate you, Golden Needle,<em> </em>and now I have defeated you. Time to delete <em>Balatro</em> until my next train ride.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post"><h3>The Myth Of The Star Reporter</h3></a><p>Good journalism isn't created in a vacuum</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339206/agdq-2025-batman-forever-the-arcade-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>, the annual charity speedrunning marathon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334425/how-to-watch-awesome-games-done-quick-agdq-2025">is in full swing</a>, already amassing over $500,000 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. With three more days to go, there’s a great many runs of popular games coming up. But relying on the schedule or your own preferences to determine when to tune in is a surefire way to miss the best AGDQ has to offer.</p><p>Take today, for example. I’ve never played <em>Batman Forever: The Arcade Game</em>, but after watching the speedrun, I might have to. It’s a Batman-flavored beat-’em-up that bears precious little resemblance to the movie it’s based on. The runner, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lrock617">LRock617</a>, chose to play as Robin and within moments of starting the game, I was hooked. The graphics were reminiscent of the early <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, appropriate since it was published by Acclaim Entertainment. But there was a surreality to them that — when combined with Robin’s overpowered abilities (like one that has him essentially go Super Saiyan), the runner’s charisma in explaining what’s happening, and the audience getting in on the fun with funny donation messages — gave the run an absurd goofiness that was a sorely needed shot in the arm at 9AM on a Wednesday morning. And if I hadn’t had the marathon on in the background, I would have missed it.</p><p>Games Done Quick’s schedule is set up to have the most popular games or gimmicky runs take place during the early evenings and weekends — the time when folks are most likely to tune in. But I’ve found some of my favorite runs are of games I’ve never heard of played well outside those primetime hours. I’ve developed a deep an abiding love of <em>Mr. Bones</em>, a Sega Saturn game I have never played, because I found it during <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-a-very-shitty-day-the-mr-bones-speedrun-helped-1846020990">a bout of January 6th-induced insomnia</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/NgQ6AKLsOwY?si=3QgLKu_rA81EL4l9"><em>Ratatouille</em> run from Summer Games Done Quick 2023</a>, one of that year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/summer-games-done-quick-2023-is-over-so-come-watch-ratatouille-cosplay">stand</a>-<a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/best-speedruns-sgdq-2023">out</a> runs, happened on a Tuesday at 11AM. </p><p>More than simply being entertained, keeping GDQ on all the time is a good way to find your next indie game. I didn’t know what<em> </em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpizza-possum-switch%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorvTrs9fk-4p2sjbGWy50hNKRxjjWIIs2vgyJgyxUJLJLNp-6oE"><em>Pizza Possum</em></a> was, but after <a href="https://youtu.be/HPjJbwzn9k8?si=OooLH-EdTHGfzuG0">watching the speedrun</a>, it’s on my list of co-op games to try at home. There’s still plenty of AGDQ left to enjoy. There’s a <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> run that’ll be played while the runner plays the piano and I cannot wait for the <em>Crazy Taxi</em> run that’ll be accompanied by a live band playing covers of the songs in the game. But I’m even more excited to find the next hidden gem of the marathon purely by chance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Compared to a Steam Deck OLED, the Switch 2 mockup still feels noticeably smaller, in part because the Joy-Cons are not as pronounced and ergonomic as the Deck’s grips. But the mockup still feels closer in size to Valve’s handheld than the original Switch.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><p><figcaption><em>A rough size comparison with a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As previous rumors have indicated, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons will attach to the console via magnets instead of a sliding rail, Genki cofounder and CEO Eddie Tsai tells <em>The Verge</em>. To detach a Joy-Con from the Switch 2, you press a big button at the top of the backside of each controller, Tsai says, and that button apparently pushes out a pin that nudges against the chassis of the console, disconnecting the magnets.</p><p>You can remove the Joy-Cons with brute force if you really wanted to, according to Tsai, but he says, overall, they feel secure for regular use and that the big release button detaches the Joy-Cons with ease. Tsai declined to share where he’d learned details of the new console.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</p><p><figcaption><em>The left JoyCon without pressing the detachment button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Tsai also tells <em>The Verge</em> that housed within the mounting channel of the Joy-Cons is an optical sensor, and by using another attachment the new Joy-Cons may offer mouse-like functionality. It sounds a bit like what Lenovo does <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">with its Legion Go handheld</a>.</p><p>Nintendo has promised that it will announce the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>, and as that deadline creeps closer, there have been waves of leaks and rumors about the new hardware. In December, YouTube channel SwitchUp posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video</a> showing a 3D-printed, non-functional Switch 2 mockup provided by a Chinese case manufacturer. That mockup basically looked like the current Switch but bigger, and it revealed a few other potential changes like a new USB-C port on the top of the device and a mysterious new square button under the Home button on the right Joy-Con.</p><p>Days later, accessories-maker Dbrand announced its “Killswitch 2” case, and CEO Adam Ijaz <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that it was designed based on “actual dimensions”&nbsp;based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” Ijaz also said that it was his “understanding” that the console’s Joy-Cons are magnetically attached. And Dbrand’s imagery showed that the new square button had a “C” printed on it, though Ijaz didn’t know what it was. Days after that, our colleague Sean Hollister spoke with a Redditor who shared apparent photos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">of the Switch 2’s dock</a> and the&nbsp;inside&nbsp;of what appears to be a Switch 2 Joy-Con.</p><p>With that April 2025 deadline inching closer every day, it seems like it won’t be long until Nintendo officially, finally reveals the Switch 2. But until that happens, at least we have these pictures to look at.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, The Washington Post (former employer of Nathan Grayson and me) laid off less than<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/washington-post-layoffs-1236249871/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 100 people</a> on the business side, the latest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2025/01/04/washington-post-trump-bezos-cartoonist-resigns/52d8560e-caeb-11ef-a9b8-74e0b395057f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upheaval</a> at the Jeff Bezos-owned paper that’s struggling with the unique problem of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/jeff-bezos-killed-washington-post-endorsement-of-kamala-harris-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it wants to be</a> during the upcoming Trump administration, and the much less unique problem of how to get people to pay money for journalism. Among those laid off were, reportedly, most of The Post’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-crisis-hit-washington-post-axes-dozens-in-cash-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR team</a>; a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lf6gudz25k2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> about a new PR strategy reads in part,</p><blockquote><p>Talent-driven journalism is the future of media, and personalities and creators will lead the way...</p><p>Effective immediately, we are repositioning the entire Post PR division to build and launch our Star Talent Unit. We will stop the dedicated practice of publicity for our journalism across broadcast and traditional media outlets…</p><p>The core focus of our team will be to ensure our audiences know who our journalists are and rely even more on these trusted voices... We will also be working closely with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/12/20/introducing-wp-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Ventures</a>, expanding our talent roster to include creators.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wagatwe.com/post/3lf6njrkztc2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stevemullis.bsky.social/post/3lf6jir2df22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alone</a> in being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lf6hgee5tk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrified</a> by the phrase “Star Talent Unit.” While it’s not clear yet precisely what this new approach will look like, the name and the mention of "creators and personalities," alongside the intention to hire more, suggest The Post could lean in on promoting whoever it considers its biggest personalities instead of the paper’s work more holistically. On its face, such a move would make a kind of sense; I think most journalists would admit influencers and content creators are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5246011/influencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nibbling our lunch</a> when it comes to engagement and subscriber money, especially among <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/media/news-influencers-social-media-conservative-study/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">younger audiences</a>. And I think we’d all admit that borrowing some of these personalities’ promotion strategies is an <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unfortunate necessity</a> these days, especially on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of the “star reporter” is a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031975/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long</a>-<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing</a> <a href="https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Paige_Sinclair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image</a> that’s been present in every newsroom I’ve worked at or known people who work at: your biggest names who do the site’s most high-profile work, and as such are afforded the autonomy, time, and pay (maybe– we’re still talking about journalism here) to do so. They do the kinds of stories that go wide, that audiences talk about, that can effect change in your beats. They become the people your site is known for and come to feel <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/abeewords.bsky.social/post/3lf6hopqtcs23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">essential</a> to, the people readers take to the comments section to declare a site “over” if they leave. Sometimes, especially these days, these folks strike out on their own, realizing they can use the name they’ve built in a newsroom to get paid by readers directly. Other times, an organization will bend over backwards to keep them, which may or may not go well for them and the people they work with.</p><p>I’m not going to pretend star power isn’t real: there are writers out there with unique strengths and compelling personalities and savvy self-promotion skills. When you’re an editor or team leader, as I’ve been, you don’t serve those writers, your outlet, or your audience by clipping their wings, but you have to balance that against the needs and strengths of everyone on your team, including those whose talents or interests lie in less flashy areas. I always wanted as best I could to give each of my writers the assignments they wanted and the things they’d excel at, to put them on the work that would be the best for both them and the outlet. This isn’t always possible: there are only so many of the biggest games of the year to review or events to cover; if everyone is heads-down in long-term reporting or ambitious criticism, no stories are going up while that work gets done; sometimes, there is just workaday news to write or videos to make or admin work to do, to keep your site functioning or to keep the suits above you happy about your page views or, simply, to serve your audience and keep them informed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you want to give everyone on your staff the time and opportunity to shine at what they shine at, and to acknowledge and promote that work accordingly, but I’m not sure–and I’ll regretfully include myself in this–I’ve ever seen that fully work out. Just as much as “star” reporters can elevate an outlet, they can wreak havoc inside it too. Resentments flourish; even in the most well-managed scenarios, it’s natural to be jealous of someone who you think gets more freedom and attention than you do. People can behave badly, leading to mercurial “stars” and mistreated or bitter colleagues. A “star” can, intentionally or not, claim a beat or style of work and crowd others out of it. Colleagues can feel like they have to, or be made to, pick up the slack while someone does long-term work without ever getting their own shot at it. A site can go from being a team of journalists to feeling like a “star” or two and their support staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the big stories from the big names go up, they can seem to an audience like the work of whoever is on the byline, when in reality <em>everything</em> that goes on the page is the product, to some extent, of everyone who works at an outlet. Great journalism doesn’t happen in a vacuum; colleagues talk a story over, point a reporter to sources, lend their expertise, give feedback, edit, suggest a headline, provide art. They write the day-to-day stories readers need, and those stories help keep the lights on and make the money that pays for the more ambitious work. The “star reporter” builds on the work and reputation of an outlet to do their work, from the kinds of stories they pursue to the sources who’ll be willing to talk to them. A good newsroom and its leaders acknowledge this, internally and externally, when a big story goes live. A handful of people’s names might be on the page, but that story is the work of everyone who works on that team, and everyone had some hand in its impact and success. A good leader, and a good organization, doesn’t leave those teammates behind or use them to build up other people’s names.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m saying this all from my perch at a version of the situation I’m warning against, an independent outlet built, at least in part, on name recognition and thus some version of star power. It’s likely you were willing to pay for Aftermath because you heard of the people who work here; you heard of us because an outlet and its team supported us in learning to make the work you’re paying for. You could see Aftermath and our worker-owned outlet peers as a success story of the very thing The Post could pursue, some kind of triumph of personal branding alongside the democratizing power of the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could also read it, more pessimistically but maybe more honestly, as a damning example of what it takes to still make journalism these days. Things weren’t going <em>so well </em>that the five of us and our colleagues at other outlets all decided there was a way to make them go even better; our organizations failed us, or didn’t want us anymore, and we went independent because it was that or leave the field. I’m aware, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld267tue7s2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every day</a>, that everyone can’t do that, that there’s a view of our sites that sees us building our own little islands and leaving others behind. I fully believe independent organizations like Aftermath and our peers are paving the way for democratic workplaces that live our values and prioritize our audiences. But we aren’t, or aren’t yet, a working alternative to the system crumbling around us, one that creates a reliable future for journalists and journalism as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to undertake all the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3le3qy5qyp22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnout-inducing</a> self-promotion and name recognition and cultivation of reader relationships as a survival mechanism as much as a unique strength of our space. The Post’s PR pivot has the potential to embrace the worst of that, to cut even more people out of having a satisfying, stable future in journalism by combining the harshest requirements of independent spheres with established journalism’s own worst habits of competition and “star power” myths. A focus on “star talent” wouldn’t serve those supposed “stars”--as we’ve <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-27366/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-after-rift-with-editors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already seen</a>, why would someone submit themselves to the strictures of an organization when even the organization is telling them their personal value will get them farther? And it wouldn’t serve the people who don’t get to be the “star talent,” who might feel their work is devalued or that they’re playing second fiddle to whoever the paper decides is worth promoting. And why would <em>anyone</em> in this situation put their efforts into The Post, or any outlet, as a whole, if that outlet's PR strategy promotes the opposite?</p><p>There’s no denying things both in established journalism and outside of it are bleak. It’s naive to be dedicated to an outlet that could fold or cut you at any moment, and it’s exhausting to add self-promotion to any writer’s already endless to-do list. One of the most well-resourced news organizations in the world should be looking for alternatives to how things currently stand, not just creating another version.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You probably won’t be too surprised to see Jeff leading the pack as the number-one pick across PC and console quickplay games. He’s sitting at 21.18% pick rate, with Venom in second at 19.09% and Cloak &amp; Dagger in third at 18.81%. At the opposite end of the list, we find Storm, with only 1.66% of players choosing to smite opponents with her weather abilities in quickplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pick rates for competitive, meanwhile, tell a slightly different story. Pop-centric healer and Strategist Luna Snow tops the pick rate list at 20.66%, with Jeff still cracking the top 10 in seventh with 13.86%. The tough-to-handle Storm remains at the bottom in competitive games at just 0.69% on PC, while Black Widow sits in last with 0.79% in competitive console matches. It also seems that the Strategist and Vanguard roles remain equally popular among players regardless of mode or platform.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Concrete numbers for Marvel Rivals show NetEase is willing to be a bit more transparent about how fans are choosing to engage with the roster, but many will likely find little surprise in the pick rate list. Jeff, specifically, has proven to be quite the punching bag for the community since launch arrived last month. This adorable dog shark has terrorized enemy teams with his It’s Jeff! Ultimate ability, which sees him swallowing multiple enemies and, usually, sending them hurtling to their deaths. He’s relatively easy to get a handle on, so it’s never been a surprise to see him show up in a match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Win rates, on the other hand, reveal that Marvel Rivals has been a mostly even experience regardless of which hero players dive into battle with. While nearly every character hovers around a 50% win rate regardless of game mode, Jeff actually finds himself on the lower end of the spectrum at 45.39% of matches won in quickplay and 44.38% in competitive. It’s actually Mantis who brings home the most consistent victories, with 56% of games won in quickplay and 55.20% won in competitive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these stats may give players clues as to how NetEase will push forward when it comes to future balance changes.

In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about the Switch 2--or whatever the next console is called--and what's been speculated about the next system from Nintendo. There has been quite a lot of news about the next Nintendo console lately. In fact, it appears the rumor mill is really heating up of late, though this doesn't necessarily mean an official announcement is coming up soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has made multiple announcements lately, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-alarmo-alarm-clock-only-works-with-switch-2-in-our-dreams/1100-6527034/" data-ref-id="1100-6527034">alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">a music app</a>, but there hasn't been any <em>official</em> word on the Switch 2. </p><p dir="ltr">2025 kicked off with a juicy rumor, as people claim to have their hands on the Switch 2's Joy-Cons. Images posted online claiming to be the new controllers suggest they will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">sport a similar design to the original, though they could be hiding a new feature or two.</a> Another recent report detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">how many units the Switch 2 could sell in the US during its first year.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Another recent report that claimed the next Nintendo console is indeed called, simply, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-indeed-called-switch-2-report/1100-6528573/" data-ref-id="1100-6528573">Switch 2. </a>One Chinese retailer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-switch-2-accessories-are-now-available-to-buy-with-a-major-asterisk/1100-6528194/" data-ref-id="1100-6528194">selling screen protectors and carrying cases for the Switch 2</a>, and these could contain clues about the form factor and size of the Switch 2. They also might be totally fake or speculative.</p><p dir="ltr">This post covers the system's potential form factor, rumors about the the Switch 2 release date, price, launch games, backward compatibility, and more. For simplicity's sake, we'll refer to the new system as the Switch 2, although it seems likely that, based on Nintendo's history, it will have some kind of new, original name for the console. Time will tell.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of unanswered questions remaining about the Switch 2, but for now, here's all the essential information we have.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_leaked_images">Switch 2 leaked images</h2><p>A major development for the Switch 2 came in mid-September 2024 when unverified images of what's claimed to be the Nintendo Switch successor<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/" data-ref-id="1100-6526551"> appeared online</a>, revealing a console that isn't a radical departure from the current Switch console design. The images suggest that the Switch will sport a bigger eight-inch screen, Joy-Cons that use a magnetic attachment, and significantly improved hardware in comparison to the current model.</p><p>The pictures were first found on a Chinese social media site and uploaded to Reddit. While Nintendo has not commented on them, a source told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alleged-images-of-nintendos-new-switch-have-appeared-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that the <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1836369796742398294" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit images line up</a> with what partners have been told to expect with the final Switch 2 design.</p><p>In November and early December 2024, the alleged Switch 2 leaked images continued to pour out, this time revealing a closer look at the reportedly updated and more ergonomically designed Joy-Cons. The images seem to show a number of updates over the existing Joy-Cons, including bigger SL/SR buttons, a pedal back button, and a more curved design, among other things.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/deckwizardyt/status/1863631563176530330" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">BREAKING: Nintendo Switch 2 Joycons Allegedly Leaked ⚠️‼️<br>✅️ Larger SL/SR Buttons<br>✅️ New Pedal Back Button<br>✅️ Curved Design<br>✅️ Resembles September 2024 Leak<br>✅️ Pics from China Factory<br>✅️ Leaked on Bilibili <a href="https://t.co/jv3LDBRu0r" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jv3LDBRu0r</a></p>  — Deck Wizard (@deckwizardyt) <a href="https://twitter.com/deckwizardyt/status/1863631563176530330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Then in January 2025, new images of the supposed Joy-Cons emerged, and, crucially, it appears the new controllers could feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">mouse functionality.</a></p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1875948187527303592" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The new Joy-con appear to have an optical sensor similar to a mouse on the side, so people are speculating now they could be used as a mouse <a href="https://t.co/mrxPvE5WPd" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/mrxPvE5WPd</a></p>  — Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1875948187527303592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 id="Switch_2_Rumored_Release_Date">Switch 2 Rumored Release Date</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't know for sure. The Switch launched in March 2017 and console generations are known to be in the area of 5-10 years, but there is no guarantee that Nintendo would follow a similar playbook with its next piece of hardware. Trends are always changing due to a variety of factors.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wii and Wii U, for example, launched in November of 2006 and 2012, but it's anyone's guess as to the launch month for the next Nintendo console.</p><p dir="ltr">A September 2024 release date for the Switch 2 emerged in an official press release from the newest interaction of GameShark. But it proved to not be legitimate. After that, an analyst suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-launching-this-year-with-8-inch-lcd-screen-report/1100-6520627/" data-ref-id="1100-6520627">Switch 2 will launch in 2024 and feature and an 8-inch LCD screen</a>--but that, of course, didn't happen either. </p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, someone at the Consumer Electronics Show spoke with peripheral company Genki and was apparently informed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">Switch 2 will launch in April 2025.</a> This is not confirmed, of course. </p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch 2 will be announced during the company's current fiscal year (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025)</a>, so the official reveal could happen anytime now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">During an earnings call</a>, Furukawa alluded to what the Switch 2 might be in terms of an evolution over the first system. Several times in the briefing, Furukawa spoke about the "successor to the Nintendo Switch," suggesting that the new device will build on the foundation established by the Switch console.</p><p>"At this stage, we cannot say anything more about the successor to Nintendo Switch," Furukawa said when asked why that term was used specifically. "For today's announcement, we determined that the most appropriate expression to use was 'successor to Nintendo Switch.' Information will be released in stages leading up to the launch, as we have done with previous new hardware announcements."</p><p>Recently, GI.biz reporter Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1823411988342374567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "No developer I've spoken to expects it to launch in this financial year, in fact they've been told not to expect it in this financial year. A bunch of people I spoke to hope it's out in April/May time."</p><p>For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer said it corroborated this</a>, noting that the next Switch console won't be released until April 2025 at the very soonest.</p><p>Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann recently told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that his company "obviously" plans to develop games for the Switch 2 and that he "can't wait for it to be out." However, he's also OK with Nintendo taking their time to get it right.</p><p>"I mean, honestly, I'd rather have them wait a year and get it perfect than rush it to the market and then we all complain about what doesn't work. Switch has been such a fantastic product, I can wait another year if I have to," he said. "And from development, I think most non-Nintendo developers are not exclusively doing titles for the Switch. They're always part of a portfolio mix of platform mix. Just wait."</p><p>Recently, analyst David Gibson suggested the Switch 2 may release in March 2025. Gibson pointed out that one of Nintendo's assembling partners, Hosiden, is spending lots of money in preparation for... something. As such, Gibson suggested this might be related to the Switch 2.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/gibbogame/status/1831321550185959553" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No-one seems to have noticed the Nintendo assembler- Hosiden is spending ¥2bn on production equipment and ¥1bn on automation in FY3/25 for its major customer in amusement (Nintendo).

Former Nintendo employees have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-employees-predict-when-they-think-switch-2-will-be-announced-and-what-it-will-be/1100-6520125/">predicted</a> it will have a similar form factor to the Switch and that it can be used as a handheld device and also dock to your TV like the existing model does. Nintendo, for its part, has said nothing at all about what to expect from its next system, apart from how the aim is for it to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-has-nothing-to-announce-but-says-next-console-aims-to-surprise-and-delight/1100-6512297/">"surprise and delight"</a> fans, so we only have predictions and guesses to go on for now.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-nintendo-switch-2-details-continue-to-emerge/1100-6518945/">Digital Foundry reported</a> that the Switch 2 may use Nvidia's new custom variant T239 processor. The site compiled a PC based on what it believed the Switch 2's specs could be and found that it could capably run Death Stranding at 1080p at an average of 35 fps.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo consoles are historically less powerful than the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and many believe that might be the case for the next system as well. But no one knows for sure. Whether or not the Switch 2 could be a 4K-capable device or offer cutting-edge graphics and performance is unknown.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vandal </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-reportedly-has-magnetic-joy-cons-might-not-support-existing-ones/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) recently reported that the Switch 2 will use Joy-Con controllers once again, but this time, they will attach to the system magnetically. Whether or not the existing Joy-Cons you might own already will work on the system is unknown. The report also mentioned how the current Switch Pro controller will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tah4ALPgOk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Silicon podcast </a>recently (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode-battery-life-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), Moore's Law Is Dead and The Phawx had a conversation in which it was suggested by Moore's Law is Dead that the Switch 2 will be "clocked faster than we expect" in its docked mode. In undocked mode, it's "going to be clocked crazy low," apparently. The goal, apparently, is to help the Switch 2 have a longer battery life when played on the go compared to the original Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023" data-ratio="0.54519774011299" data-width="2124" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4245023"></a><figcaption>The next Nintendo console could launch in 2024</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4245023-screenshot2024-01-11at1.47.56pm.png"></figure><p>While Switch sales boomed during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage presented new challenges for Nintendo as it struggled to meet demand. For the Switch 2, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">doesn't "anticipate" this to be a problem ahead of the launch of the Switch 2</a>. At the same time, Nintendo's sales forecast for the financial year doesn't currently factor in Switch 2 sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-window-still-uncertain-despite-nintendos-earnings-news-analyst-says/1100-6523313/" data-ref-id="1100-6523313">but that could change in time</a>.</p><h2 id="Gen_AI_">Gen AI?</h2><p>Artificial intelligence, or more specifically, generative artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games--and technology in general. But will Nintendo implement genAI for the Switch 2 and its games? It remains to be seen, but Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently weighed in to say Nintendo will carefully consider the use of genAI.</p><p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A with investors</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>, Furukawa is reported to have said AI has been used in video game development for ages already for things like controlling enemy characters. But genAI is a different story.</p><p>"Generative AI, which has been a hot topic in recent years, can be more creative, but we also recognize that it has issues with intellectual property rights," he said. "We have decades of know-how in creating optimal gaming experiences for our customers, and while we remain flexible in responding to technological developments, we hope to continue to deliver value that is unique to us and cannot be achieved through technology alone."</p><h2 id="Switch_2_Games_and_Backward_Compatibility">Switch 2 Games and Backward Compatibility</h2><p>It's widely expected that Nintendo will release a new Mario Kart game for its next home console–there are not many safer bets in gaming that one could make. A report said Mario Kart 9 will have some kind of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-should-use-these-new-twist-ideas/1100-6499581/">"new twist,"</a> and fans are eagerly waiting to see what that might be. If a new Mario Kart game is in the works, it would seemingly make business sense for it to be a launch title for the next console. A report from 2023 said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-already-with-developers-launching-in-2024-report/1100-6516402/">a number of developers already had the new Nintendo console at their offices</a> and were beginning to build games for it, but none have been announced or even hinted at thus far.</p><p dir="ltr">A major question fans want to know is whether or not the next Nintendo console will support games from the Switch, and on November 6, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2</a>. Not only that, but Nintendo Switch Online will work across Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," Nintendo confirmed. "Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep checking back with GameSpot for more as we learn more about the next Nintendo console, as we'll continue to update this story as more information comes to light.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_Price">Switch 2 Price</h2><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 has not been announced, so everything is guesswork at this stage. But one analyst recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-employees-predict-when-they-think-switch-2-will-be-announced-and-what-it-will-be/1100-6520125/">predicted</a> that the Switch 2 will cost $400 and that its top-tier games will sell for $70. The original Switch launched at $300, and its relatively low price point no doubt helped the system perform exceptionally well in the market. Whether or not the next Nintendo console launches with just one SKU or multiple editions, at various price points, remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the prediction about game costs rising to $70, that wouldn't be very surprising. After all, Nintendo already charged $70 for Tears of the Kingdom, and it was a sales juggernaut at that price point. Nintendo said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-will-be-worth-its-70-price-tag-nintendo-president-says/1100-6512284/">that was a one-off for Switch game prices</a>, but charging $70 for Switch 2 games would bring Nintendo in line with what companies like Microsoft and Sony, as well as a variety of third-party publishers, charge for their leading titles.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Switch_2_News">Switch 2 News</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's previous consoles had their own account systems and players had to create new accounts for subsequent hardware launches. But the new overarching Nintendo Account changes this, and this could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-says-transition-from-switch-to-next-console-will-be-smoother-than-before/1100-6518543/">ease the transition to the next Nintendo console. </a></p><p dir="ltr">It "allows us to communicate with our players if and when we make a transition to a new platform, to help ease that process or transition," Nintendo's Doug Bowser said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to minimize the dip you typically see in the last year of one cycle and the beginning of another," he added. "I can't speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's CEO, Shuntaro Furukawa, said in 2023 that the next Nintendo console will use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">the same Nintendo Account system as the Switch</a>, so hearing Bowser suggest something similar is no big surprise.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/nintendo-s-record-gain-tested-in-wait-for-switch-2-tech-watch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Yijia Zhai of Macquarie Group Ltd. said the next Nintendo console is not going to be able to match the success of the Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not think the new console will be as successful as the Switch, and see potential profit-taking after the announcement," Zhai said, further noting that Macquarie had downgraded Nintendo's stock analysis to "neutral."</p><p dir="ltr">Goldman Sachs analyst Minami Munakata, meanwhile, said the next Nintendo hardware likely won't increase the total addressable market for Nintendo. However, the firm isn't married to that idea and says its forecast could change if the system "turns out to be new concept hardware rather than a successor along the same lines as the Nintendo Switch."</p><p dir="ltr">A console not being as successful as the last one might not tell the whole story and isn't necessarily totally bad news for Nintendo. The Switch, of course, performed exceptionally well in terms of hardware and software sales. And that success is all the more apparent following the dismal performance of the Wii U.</p><p>In September 2024, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said the next Nintendo console may "disrupt" the video game industry.</p><p>"A couple of things will really impact how things go: Nintendo's next hardware device, expected to arrive next year, could significantly disrupt the market," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheap-money-and-bad-bets-how-the-games-industry-turned-pandemic-success-into-disaster" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told GI.biz</a>. "Of course, not much is known about this device beyond rumor, but a highly successful new Nintendo device could apply downward pricing pressure across other devices. But we'll have to wait and see."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/uber-meta-creative-assembly-vets-found-studio-atelico-to-bring-generative-ai-to-video-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Studio Atelico is a brand new gaming startup that has been founded by veterans of Uber, Meta, and Creative Assembly. Today they announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/startup-exists-announces-new-genai-gaming-platform/">new AI Engine</a> that will enable game developers to create game experiences that are powered by GenAI that run on-device without having to pay extortionate prices for cloud solutions. With Atelico AI Engine, the costs of production are significantly reduced for developers, and it provides them with an experience that gives them full control and power.</p>
<p>CEO, Piero Molino made a statement today regarding their new AI engine, saying: "The revolution is upon us. GenAI is enabling new interactive experiences that have never been possible before. However, the current, large-model approach that Cloud AI providers are taking is fundamentally flawed for video games. Game developers currently implementing GenAI in their games are struggling due to the high costs and the lack of fine-grained control needed in video game development."</p>
<p><iframe title="Studio Atelico - Generative Agents Real-time Playground (GARP)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/krOP_bIW74g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, Generative AI in gaming is a heavy point of contention for both the consumer and the creator. There are people who feel that it should be left safely in the hands of humans to develop, while others feel that there are creative minds out there who should be able to use tools to make the development process easier without having to put the effort in.</p>
<p>Already there are many games on the market using AI, with a fair few of them not disclosing the fact that they are using AI in their titles. An<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ex-Steam Labs developer</a> has claimed that there are over 1000 Steam games that are using generative AI. This includes titles such as The Finals, Tribes 3, and Atman: Rebel Flame.</p>
<p>While most known studios won't be using AI for their games, more and more studios and developers are coming out of the woodwork with AI games. With the release of the Atelico AI Engine, there will now be even more potential for AI titles.</p>
<p>The Atelico AI Engine can be embedded into game engines, where the user will have full control and flexibility with the modular design of the tool. To showcase the tool, Studio Atelico has released a tech demo which is inspired by the Stanford paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." You can see the tech demo above, where you can see the model in action.</p>
<p>"Atelico AI Engine is the perfect tool for developers to invent entirely new game genres. We foresee a Cambrian explosion of creativity, where our AI tools empower designers to build more immersive experiences and truly widen the horizon of what's possible. The only limitation is the developer's imagination," says <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/cloud-ai-for-video-games-is-dead-on-arrival?dm_i=2AEH,21IEL,AMZC5B,7EFIS,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ennio De Nucci, Co-Founder and Design</a> Director of Studio Atelico.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of TTRPGs have announced what they are looking forward to in 2025. The new year is rife with exciting TTRPG projects. Some are from beloved studios, and some are based on acclaimed properties. However, according to one survey, the most anticipated RPG is Son of Oak's <em>Legend in the Mist</em>.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/here-are-2025s-most-anticipated-ttrpgs-as-voted-by-you.709410/" rel="nofollow">EN World's annual survey</a>, dedicated TTRPG fans gave the spotlight to 10 games they were most looking forward to in 2025.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legend-in-the-mist-crow-thaumaturge-artwork.jpg?itok=bphsECIR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legend-in-the-mist-crow-thaumaturge-artwork.jpg?itok=UxTp_mBB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at number one is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-kickstarter-ends-with-over-16-times-its-funding-goal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legend in the Mist</em></a>. Son of Oak's successfully crowdfunded fantasy RPG made a splash on Kickstarter. The game, which uses the same underlying system as the urban fantasy TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/off-shelf-city-of-mist-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>City of Mist</em></a>, made more than sixteen times its funding goal, concluding with over $855,000 raised.</p>

<p>This is an impressive accomplishment in popularity given the game's competition. <em>Legend in the Mist</em> beat out Darrington Press' highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Modiphius' adaptation of an acclaimed British author Terry Pratchett's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/discworld-board-games-coming-courtesy-of-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em></a>, and fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the other entries in the Most Anticipated TTRPG have established quality names. MCDM Productions' <em>Draw Steel</em>, their <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mcdm-productions/mcdm-rpg" rel="nofollow">successfully crowdfunded</a> response to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tabletop-developers-prepare-for-ogl-less-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D OGL</a> debacle. Free League Publishing's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em></a> and <em>Alien: Evolved Edition</em>. Pelgrane Press' <em>13th Age Second Edition</em> and Necrotic Gnome's <em>Dolmenwood</em>. Even Paizo Inc's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder"><em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em></a> appears on this list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/draw-steel-dragonborn-warrior.jpg?itok=NoPQhPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/draw-steel-dragonborn-warrior.jpg?itok=mJ7LS5xK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>Legend in the Mist</em> stands out from its competition is its narrative focus. Characters don't have attributes but keywords, allowing background details and character traits to have in-game impacts on spells and weapons. In addition to the built-in character motivation and story arc system, the game can support tactical play, journeying, exploration, and just about any magic system,</p>

<p>Legend in the Mist is set to release digitally in Spring of 2025 with a physical release in Summer 2025.</p>

But how many units will the system sell? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US during 2025.</p><p>This assumes that the Switch 2 launches in the first half of 2025, Piscatella clarified. He added that the Switch should make up about one third of all video game consoles sold during 2025 in the US, excluding PC portable devices.</p><p>Piscatella went on to say that he expects the Switch 2 to face "hardware constraints" for several months after launch, and that the total number of units sold will depend on how many Nintendo can produce. Despite the popularity of a new Nintendo console, Piscatella said he continues to expect Sony's PlayStation 5 to be the No. 1 best-selling console in the US in 2025 based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo's platforms are popular globally, and US sales represent just one piece of the console's expected overall sales.

            <p>
With the decorations packed away for another 12 months and the new year now well and truly begun, developer Mojang has roused from its festive slumber to release six new features for public testing ahead of Minecraft's first planned update of 2025.
</p>
<p>
Mojang did, of course, announce it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">changing the way it released new Minecraft content</a> last September, revealing it would be ditching its traditional mega-sized summer updates in favour of multiple smaller drops throughout the year. And it's now <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-year-new-testing-features">detailed a number of the features</a> it'll launching (and that are now available for testing) in Minecraft's first update in 2025.
</p>
<p>
That starts with two new pig variants, intended to complement the bog-standard one that's been available in-game for 15 years now. More specifically, it's introducing the new cold pig and warm pig variants - found in sub-zero biomes and sandy biomes respectively.
</p>
<p>
Elswhere, forests biomes are getting an upgrade in Minecraft's next update, thanks to three new ambient features: falling leaves, leaf litter, and wildflowers. Falling leaves are encountered in all forest biomes, but leaf litter - which crunches underfoot and can be used to decorate other blocks - is exclusive to dark forests and wooded badlands.
</p><p>
Wildflowers, meanwhile, are found in meadows and birch forests (plus their old growth counterparts), manifesting as yellow and white flowers that can be crafted into dye. These all have four growth stages players can speed up with bonemeal, and will bloom in different patterns depending on the angle they're placed in.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
And finally for now, lodestones - the magnetised blocks players can place in order to helpfully attract their compasses while navigating - have a new, simpler crafting recipe.
</p>
<p>
All the above features are scheduled to arrive as part of Minecraft's next update, but they're first being released for public testing so adventurous players can put them through their paces. All six additions are accessible via Minecraft's latest Java snapshot right now, and everything except Minecraft's new leaf litter and wildflowers are available in the Bedrock preview and beta. Those two missing features should hit Bedrock "soon", and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features">more information on accessing Minecraft's test builds</a> can be found on Mojang's website.

It’s refreshing after seeing <em>Overwatch 2</em> sand off all its edges in pursuit of being the main esports hero shooter on the market. However, the hope that the wonkiness would last felt like a pipe dream for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, as NetEase was eventually going to have to put out some balance changes that would tone down some of the shenanigans.

Some of the previously announced hero changes are here, such as the nerfs for Hela and Hawkeye and the buffs for Venom and Captain America, but there’s also a handful of smaller tweaks to a large swath of the roster. I’d still argue Cap needs a bit more damage to his kit if he’s going to be a brawler and that Hela’s minimal health reduction is not enough, but it’s probably the right approach to make some light changes here and there instead of turning the dial too far in either direction.</p><p>Individual heroes got rebalanced, but several Team-Up abilities also got some buffs. Almost all of the ones affected received perks of some kind, whether that be in shorter cooldowns or increased damage output. The full notes patch read as follows:</p><h2 id="h425394"><a id=""></a><strong>VANGUARD</strong></h2><p><strong>Captain America</strong><br><em>Steve will receive some enhanced survivability, allowing more frequent entering and exiting of the combat.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Reduce the delay time for shield restoration after releasing Living Legend from 3s to 2s.</em></li><li><em>Reduce Liberty Rush cooldown from 12s to 10s.</em></li><li><em>Increase base health from 650 to 675.</em></li><li><em> Reduce the energy cost for releasing Freedom Charge (ultimate ability) from 3400 to 3100; Reduce the additional health provided per second to self after releasing it from 110 to 100.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Doctor Strange</strong><br><em>We’ll be reducing the threat range and increasing the defense window of the Sorcerer Supreme.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Add damage falloff to Maelstrom of Madness and Gamma Maelstrom.

And like Steam becoming the de facto way people play PC games in 2025, SteamOS will soon be the most popular way to play PC titles on the go, which is not great for Microsoft. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,194341,194651" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">The Steam Deck launched in February 2022</a></span> and within months, it had changed the landscape of the video game industry and popularized the idea of handheld, portable gaming PCs. But the Steam Deck wasn’t powered by Windows as most gaming PCs are these days. Instead, it was powered by SteamOS, a Linux-based, gaming-focused operating system that made it easier than ever to buy, install, and play almost any PC game on the portable device. And it’s SteamOS—and Valve’s dedication to making a gaming-focused OS—that made the Steam Deck a big hit. </p><h2 id="h73341"><a id=""></a>SteamOS is the reason the Steam Deck is popular</h2><p>Companies had tried to do handheld gaming PCs (not laptops) before Valve. One example would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPD Win</a></span>, which featured a full keyboard and built-in Xbox controls. It could play games, but it ran on Windows, and felt clunky and slow. Other Windows- or Linux-based handheld PC were similarly clunky, hard to use, and often expensive. </p><p>The Steam Deck succeeded because it’s dead simple and easy to use, thanks to SteamOS and its compatibility features. Nearly any Steam game you already own, besides VR stuff, can work on the Steam Deck. And, in most cases, you won’t have to do much of anything to get it running. You use the easy-to-navigate menus of SteamOS to select a game, install it, and hit play. That’s it. </p><p>In the years since Valve released the Steam Deck and its slick operating system, other companies like Lenovo and ROG have released Steam-Deck-like competitors. And while many of these devices are more powerful than the Steam Deck, none of them include SteamOS, instead running on Windows 11. As a result, these devices are harder to use and clunkier. And sure, the companies behind them have tried to add their own software to make things easier, but it’s never quite as simple as the Steam Deck It’s that simplicity that allowed a lot of people who didn’t consider themselves PC gamers to buy a Steam Deck and enjoy it anyway as a straightforward, console-like experience.</p><h2 id="h73342"><a id=""></a>Microsoft let Valve create and then dominate the market</h2><p>During all of this, Microsoft had a chance to potentially step in and offer a lightweight, easy-to-use version of Windows 11 that portable PC makers could slap onto their devices. But the parent company of Xbox never did. </p><p>Now, in 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve is ready to make it easier</a></span> than ever to install SteamOS on more devices. Not only that, but now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo has announced the first third-party device</a></span> that will ship with SteamOS.  I expect by 2026 all handheld makers will offer SteamOS versions of their existing devices; likely at a cheaper price, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989">Sure, <em>now </em>Microsoft is talking more openly about a portable</a></span>, Xbox-like device and changes to Windows 11 that will make it a more handheld-friendly experience. But it really feels like Microsoft dragged its feet for too long and is now trying to play catch up. And I just don’t think it will be able to offer a version of Windows 11 that will be better than SteamOS anytime soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Valve is soon going to let any company use its gaming OS as the backbone of future devices, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let users install SteamOS</a></span> on any portable PC they own.</p><p>This is likely to lead to a situation in which SteamOS is just considered the default way to play games on a portable PC, similar to how Steam is vastly more popular than Microsoft’s built-in Microsoft/Xbox/whatever app store that comes pre-installed on all Windows devices. And if SteamOS makes its way onto TV-based console-like devices or desktops, I think it will find a lot of success there too. A lot of people want to just play games, surf the web, and maybe listen to some music on their PC, and SteamOS can accommodate all of that easily. </p><p>Microsoft had a chance to compete with Valve in the handheld gaming space. Instead, it just...didn’t. Microsoft will likely never be able to dethrone SteamOS as the most popular way to play PC games on the go, especially if Valve keeps updating it to be better, faster, and easier to use. </p><p>Sure, Microsoft won’t go bankrupt anytime soon, but Xbox had a chance to dominate a corner of the gaming market and possibly expand its reach on desktop PCs, too. But time has seemingly run out for that to happen, and Valve has won again.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
