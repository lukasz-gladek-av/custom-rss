            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a> has shelved development on an RPG but is releasing it as a demo, allowing players to enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Adam "adamgryu" Robinson-Yu started Untitled Paper RPG back in 2016, saying, "I was nostalgic for the old style of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> and thought - well, I make games, why not try making the game I want to see? I started cooking something up in Unity and… it looked cool! I thought, maybe I really could make this game."</p>
<p>Now, almost 10 years later, Robinson-Yu said they felt "overwhelmed", adding "the scope felt too big, I didn't have a story", doubts crept in about the turn-based combat, and "in general, started to lose the joy that I felt working on it".</p>

<p>"After releasing A Short Hike and working on the subsequent updates and ports… I didn't really want to go back to this game?" Robinson-Yu admitted. "The development for the RPG had become difficult, which was why I took a break from it in the first place. I might return to this project someday, but I've been working on other things and don't see myself making time for this RPG in near future."</p>
<p>Consequently, if you pop on over to the <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game#download">official website</a>, you can download a demo with one to two hours of content for both PC and Mac.</p>
<p>"Some people still ask about this game! I figured maybe sharing the demo is better than nothing," Robinson-Yu added, explaining why it's been released as a demo. "There is 1-2 hours of gameplay in the current build, after all. There's some stuff in there that I'm proud of, even if there's also some stuff that I find embarrassing! Hope you enjoy taking a peek behind the curtain at a game partway through an aimless development."</p>
<p>"Just finished a few minutes ago," said one player in the comments. "This was a wonderful demo. I had a gut feeling you wouldn't go back to this, but I never expected you'd actually drop a demo of what you have put together. It already has so much of the personality, humour, attention to detail and innate Nintendo-esque playfulness that defined your work on A Short Hike - and this was first!</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking the big leap of putting this out there!"</p>
<p>As for what else Robinson-Yu has planned? That includes an action aventure game, a "micro-RPG with a claymation asethetic", and an online platforming roguelike.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-short-hike-dev-halts-work-on-unfinished-rpg-saying-i-might-never-finish-this-so-im-releasing-the-demo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Void Interactive has confirmed the console port of its violent shooter, Ready or Not, has been changed "as absolutely required by our first party partners", including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence". And in some instances, these changes may be applied to the PC version, too.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1144200/announcements/detail/526472884483260568">update</a> posted to Steam, the team said that after some changes, the game secured a PEGI 18 / USK 18 / ESRB M-rating, and was "fortunate enough [...] to pass certification for the launch on our first submission". Void was now "relieved" to be finished with the console launch certification process and says any changes made "remain faithful to the original tonality of the game".</p>

<p>"Maintaining multiple versions of the game with different assets and system mechanics increases the likelihood of bugs to occur in future updates, and subsequent challenges keeping the game updated across multiple versions," the team explained, justifying why it's had to tweak the PC version, too. "Think lighting or optimisation issues, for example (or any number of unexpected bugs from maintaining different versions).</p>
<p>"If the in-game assets were not the same, it would make crossplay unusable; the game content must be equal or basically equal for multiplayer to work. Different versions of assets affects multiplayer replication, which is the ability for the server to understand what’s happening in-game and host players in the same lobby/server."</p>
<p>Player-induced dismemberment "still has a large presence" in the game, "but is a little more limited as to when it occurs", and you can't, for example, keep dismembering an enemy once it's dead. Tangentially, character art "involving torture were turned down slightly to be less over-the-top". The team has also had to "cover up" some characters "a bit more".</p>
<p>"Although we already make a substantial effort to present mistreatment against children in the game in a responsible way, we made slight thematic expansions of this philosophy in order to better meet certification standards," the team explained when it came to violence against children. "For example, the child on Twisted Nerve has had an animation change to be unconscious/sleeping, instead of the previously convulsive animation from before that had a violent appearance.</p>
<p>"The changes with the console version are small enough that most people here wouldn't notice if we didn't say anything, but we want to be transparent. It's largely just evidence and nudity that's altered, and the texture changes don't affect the PC version." In-game evidence of "illicit child stuff" has also been censored, but only in the console version.</p>
<p>Some fans have responded to the changes by review-bombing the game on Steam, citing "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052063771/recommended/1144200">cowardly</a>" "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199497107322/recommended/1144200/">censorship</a>".</p>
<p>Ready or Not will release for consoles on 15th July, 2025.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Players have hit out at The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios after AI prompts were discovered in both subtitles and flavour text in the game, intimating routine use of large language models (LLMs) without disclosure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618">January 2024</a>, Valve has required games that use pre- or live-generated AI to divulge this as part of the Steam Distribution Agreement. This includes art, code, sound, and more that have been created with the help of AI tools. At the time of writing, The Alters has made no such disclosure.</p>

<p>In one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vysetron.pixeldie.com/post/3lsc3n4zhfc2k">example</a>, an in-game screen that's presumably there to look all sci-fi-y and scientific begins with: "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data".</p>
<p>Another commenter who'd played through with subtitles on Brazilian Portuguese <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leaitepuc.bsky.social/post/3lsojo3f75c2c">noted</a> "several times the subtitles go crazy", which was later backed up with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/windblow.org/post/3lsomub3i3k2g">screenshot</a> that evidenced it. The subtitle read: "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is: Every conversation two people can have, right? So we-"</p>

<p>"The game is using AI-generated content without a proper Steam Page disclaimer!" said another player on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1601570/discussions/0/604160267118483770/">Steam</a>. "This is absolutely unacceptable. 11 bit studios has been caught using AI in The Alters without ANY disclaimer on the Steam page.</p>
<p>"Steam requires developers to disclose AI use for a reason. We have the right to know what we're buying. If you're going to use AI to create content, be honest about it instead of trying to hide it."</p>
<p>Not all players have taken umbrage, however.</p>

<p>"You may have a point regarding the translations, if those were indeed AI generated. But to use this screenshot as an example of AI generated content is a joke."</p>

<p>"Look, I love The Alters. It's brilliantly written, and I was planning on leaving it a glowing Steam review once I was done. But this is a disgrace. Seriously, leaving parts of an AI prompt in the lockit?! Talk about spitting in the face of your international audience!</p>
<p>"According to the OP, some parts of the PT-BR translation are also riddled with errors and inaccuracies, which is appalling considering how the whole game revolves around an intricate narrative."</p>
<p>Danilov posited that the mistake was either the work of a "careless translator taking shortcuts", or it was "done by someone on the dev/publisher side who couldn't be arsed sending last-minute missing lines for translation and decided to throw them in a random LLM without oversight".</p>
<p>Handong Ryu, who handled the Korean translation for the game, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7344697496150941696?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7344697496150941696%2C7344781387704483840%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287344781387704483840%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7344697496150941696%29">replied</a>: "I was responsible for translating the vast majority of the Korean version of The Alters. Unfortunately, the same issue exists in the Korean version as well, which makes it more likely that the second scenario you mentioned is closer to the truth. While no AI prompt has been exposed, I can confirm that the same section of the Korean localisation shows clear signs of having been run through an LLM without proper editing.</p>
<p>"There has been significant backlash from the Korean gaming community, and it has been really disheartening to witness, especially since the criticism stems from a part of the game I had no control over."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, 11 Bit has not publicly addressed the allegations or responded to player comments. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-3-is-ditching-its-ai-generated-art-after-some-initial-feedback">Jurassic Park Evolution 3 removed generative AI for scientists' portraits</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3, "following some initial feedback".</p>
<p>"There's something startlingly unique about what 11 Bit Studios does in its games, and the moral quandaries it puts us in, and this clone story in The Alters is no exception," Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-alters-review">Eurogamer's The Alters review</a>, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p>"It takes us to the strange places I hoped it would, and prods and probes and makes me think about what I value in life. It's uneven at times, and some ideas feel underdeveloped, but then, I remember, this merging of ideas is new, and that's what I like so much about it."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo-would-feel-right-at-home-on-your-gba.1231230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When I was a kid, there was a moment when it felt like everyone was obsessed with yo-yos. I never got better than just being able to make the yo-yo go up and down. But with <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em>, I could pretend like I was halfway decent — all while playing a silly game that feels like a spiritual successor to the Game Boy Advance titles I loved growing up.</p><p><em>Pipistrello</em> is a top-down adventure game, in which you use your yo-yo to attack enemies and traverse the world. You play as Pippit, a goofy bat who has dreams of yo-yo excellence but is also a freeloader who relies on financial support from his wealthy aunt, an energy magnate. In the opening minutes of the game, the aunt gets merged with your yo-yo as four big baddies steal her Mega Batteries, and your goal is to get the batteries back and help free her.</p><p>The game is quite charming. Pippit is a lovable doofus, and you’ll also be tasked with ridiculous missions like rounding up people for a soccer fan club so you can get easier access to a stadium run by a corrupt boss, who wants people to gamble. The pixel art is great, too — it looks exactly like what I remember from GBA games, even though I played <em>Pipistrello</em> on my Steam Deck OLED’s far more modern screen. (But if you want to go full retro, there is a mode that mimics the GBA’s look, and it even frames the game on a pretend handheld.)</p><p>Pocket Trap, the game’s developer, makes Pippit’s yo-yo more than just a toy. It’s also good for bashing enemies, of course. But you can even chuck the yo-yo off the string to hit enemies at range or spin it around you to keep them at bay. And as you progress, you’ll get additional yo-yo-themed moves that will help you more easily fend off baddies, explore the city that the game takes place in, and solve puzzles. Many of the moves are based on actual yo-yo tricks: the walk the dog move, for example, sends the yo-yo surging forward, yanking Pippit along so he can cross bodies of water. </p><p>The game also has a very good skill tree with a contract-based system. When you pick up a contract, you have to work off a money debt and deal with some kind of penalty until you pay back the contract in full, like losing a heart or some attack power. The system forces you to be thoughtful about which contract to take on and helps keep you from becoming overpowered too quickly.</p><p>Not that you should really worry about getting too strong, though. I found that <em>Pipistrello</em> was <em>really</em> difficult, especially early on. <em>Pipistrello</em> has a lot of combat, and enemies frequently overwhelmed me. There’s not a huge penalty for dying — you just lose some coins and can tackle the room again — but some rooms were still pretty tough and took multiple tries to finish. </p><p>Fortunately, <em>Pipistrello</em> has a very flexible difficulty system that lets you tweak things like your attack power or how many coins enemies drop. You can even nullify fall damage. As I played, I frequently messed around with the options to help smooth over some particularly tricky sections.</p><p>I’ll admit that by the end of my nearly 10-hour playthrough, I often made myself invincible so that I could more quickly see the rest of the story, the puzzles, and the platforming. The combat rooms became too much of a time suck for me. But even though the enemies posed no danger, I still had a blast yo-yoing them to death. And I still had to figure out puzzles on my own, too, so it’s not like I made the game a total walk in the park.</p><p>If you’re feeling nostalgic for the pixel graphics and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEezCi7ucf4">blaring horns</a> of GBA games, <em>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</em> scratches that itch — and has some clever new ideas, too. It won’t actually make you better at using a yo-yo, but it’s pretty darn fun to have one in a video game.</p><p><sup>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></sup></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/692172/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo-review]]></content:encoded>

Now that many of us have a shiny new console in our hands, we've got a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>But before we look at the future all starry-eyed, it's time to look back at the year's very best for the first six months. Sure, the Switch 2 is a highlight, but we've had months of excellent Switch 1 games, and many of us are sitting on a backlog as tall as a skyscraper now we can't put down our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>s or our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>s.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mtpvix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h2>Stealing time and Magnolias (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eead7dc1af16b/ender-magnolia-bloom-in-the-mist.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Binary Haze Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's the end of June and, once again, I'm lamenting that I haven't spent more time with Switch games. This happens every year, but that kind of statement sounds even more ridiculous when you've played a lot of remakes and remasters and spent over 100 hours on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty</a> each, right?</p>
<p>There's another game that is going to join that elusive 100+ club, <em>and</em> I'm head over heels in love with it. I knew what I was getting into with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> (I never played the 3DS one), but I've sat down multiple times and lost <em>hours</em> just by doing stuff. It's a game that was made in a laboratory specifically for me, and I'm scared for my free time.</p>
<p>Something a <em>little</em> more condensed that I ended up adoring is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_magnolia_bloom_in_the_mist">Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</a>. I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ender_lilies_quietus_of_the_knights">Lilies</a> and it back-to-back and the sequel is a huge step up; the movement and control options are divine, the combat is more polished, the bosses are extremely fun, and the map is excellent. It's an almost-perfect concoction of Metroidvania ingredients.</p>
<h2>X marks the spot (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Please, Touch the Artwork 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ba174390748d/please-touch-the-artwork-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Thomas Waterzooi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since we found out that Switch 2 might give old games a performance bump, I found myself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-are-you-ghosting-switch-1-to-save-yourself-for-switch-2">ghosting the console</a> to an extent, sitting tight until the successor dropped and I could bathe in the super smooth frame rates and 'silent' updates that sees Switch 1 games reach their full potential. And now it's here!... and I'm predictably buried under Switch 2 games now (several of which are excellent, but they'll get their props from other people here).</p>
<p>Yep, I've gone and curtailed my S1 sampling quite a bit having dipped back into various Wii games — Hi, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a>! Hi, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/excite_truck">Excite Truck</a>! Hi, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rhythm_heaven_fever">Rhythm Heaven Fever</a>! — in recent months, but I'd like to give a shoutout to two games at different ends of the size spectrum: Xenoblade Chronicles X, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/please_touch_the_artwork_2">Please, Touch The Artwork 2</a>.</p>
<p>The former got its due acclaim at launch, and while I'm only (!) maybe a dozen hours in, it took that long to really click with me, and I'm now gagging to return and finish it off. The latter is a minnow (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/please-touch-the-artwork-2">which I reviewed</a>, in fact) and while it's not an earth-shaker, it deserves a mention here at the very least as a great little amuse-bouche among the obvious titans.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we're on games I reviewed, I'll give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> a nod, too. From the tone of coverage elsewhere, it's hard to understand what some people expected from it (and backlash to the pricing is an obvious factor), but from my perspective? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">As I said,</a> it's like an Iwata Asks interview in interactive form; I don't see how anyone who's ever enjoyed one of those could dislike it! As ever, different strokes.</p>

<h2>It's definitive (Gonçalo Lopes, contributor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77e55219e37d6/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hardware transition years are always a tricky thing mostly because there shouldn't be that many exciting things going on with Switch until the inevitable deluge of games on Switch 2 starts to drop. So I feel like a bit of a cheat, but my GOTY so far is Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>That’s right, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/xenoblade_chronicles_x">decade old game</a> (which of course was my GOTY 2015) that brings so many quality-of-life upgrades and a brand new three-part final chapter that wraps up the plot in an extremely pleasant way put every other Nintendo release on the first half of 2025 to shame.</p>
<p>I’m quite looking forward to see what Nintendo has in store for the rest of the year because I suspect my GOTY 2025 is still somewhere down the line (perhaps the adventures of a certain intergalactic bounty hunter or a very strong ape and teenage adopted daughter?). But the industry taught me that better hardware does not always equal better games and despite the original release age, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition definitely left a huge impression in yours truly.</p>
<h2>Citizen, weeper (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d31b73cde5920/citizen-sleeper-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've polished off quite a few games so far this year, but very few of them have actually come out of 2025 — backlog? Never heard of it! One that did release in the last six months, mind you, and absolutely <em>destroyed</em> me was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>.</p>
<p>I missed out on the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> by having too much on my plate at the time, but my love for TTRPGs made me ever so curious about its follow-up, and <em>oh my gosh</em>, my investment was off the charts. The writing is incredible, the music is phenomenal, and the final act left me snot-crying on the corner of the sofa while my partner frantically tried to work out what a 'Sleeper' was and whether she needed to make me breathe into a paper bag.</p>
<p>You can play CS2 however you'd like to, so there's no guarantee that your robo-pal would go through the same arc mine did. That said, I challenge anyone to spend a few hours with this colourful cast of characters and <em>not</em> quickly develop a crew that you'd be willing to die for. Just superb stuff, and if it's <em>not</em> on my GOTY list come December, we'll have had a <em>very</em> good second half.</p>
<h2>Life's a fantasy (Kate Gray, contributor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e0e4e2f96439/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a lot of GOTY candidates already, which means it's been a fantastic year, but I think my frontrunner for the time being is <strong>Fantasy Life i</strong>.</p>
<p>I gave it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">a 9 in my review</a>, and they actually FIXED one of my main issues (the farming), so if anything, it's even better now! It's a worthy successor to the original, and it's, like, three entire games stuffed into one. I don't always like an overstuffed game that tries to be everything, but FLi pulls it off extremely well.</p>
<h2>Robots and time travel (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/929694b09c46f/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: XSEED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It would have been lovely to list a bunch of Switch 2 titles here, but alas, as good as the new console's launch line-up has proven to be, none of them will ultimately make my GOTY list for 2025.</p>
<p>There's one clear winner for me (which I suspect you might have already guessed), but I want to give a shoutout to two titles that came <em>very</em> close to taking an early lead. The first is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a>, a magnificent arcade remake from the minds of Llamasoft's Jeff Minter and Ivan 'Giles' Zorzin that sunk its psychedelic claws into me right from the start. It's such a unique experience, and one that probably won't appeal to everyone, but once it 'clicks', it's <em>really</em> hard to put down.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>. I'll be honest, I've barely touched the likes of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/power_stone_2">Power Stone 2</a> and <strong>Project Justice</strong>, but my goodness, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001</a> has me in a chokehold. Its wealth of options is almost overwhelming at first, but I love tinkering with the different grooves and seeing which one speaks to me the most. What an excellent fighter.</p>
<p>But of course, the true winner here is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. I go into much greater detail in my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-not-enough-people-are-talking-about-this-early-goty-contender">recent feature piece</a>, but in a nutshell, it's a game that just keeps on surprising and delighting long after you roll credits. Its characters are incredibly memorable, and although I'm not much of a strategy fan, the combat proved to be consistently compelling throughout.</p>
<h2>Master swords and anti-grav racing FTW (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Fast Fusion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb139ecfbb8bf/fast-fusion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Shin'en</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, and maybe surprisingly — or not — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> doesn't stand a chance of a look-in for me here, as great as it is. Instead, besides retrying every game I own to see which ones play better whilst my sons mock me and call me "bald nerd man", I've found myself absolutely bloody engrossed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> all over again.</p>
<p>Now, I sort of blasted through it really, really quickly on a (borrowed) Wii U when it first came out, so I hightailed it through a whole lot of things, and did very little side stuff. What this led to was a Master Sword-less playthrough (I'm not sure I even started the quest to get it in the forest). What's more, I scaled the outside of Hyrule Castle at the end to save time, like a big Irish ninja, going straight into the boss battle from the balcony of the room involved, if I remember correctly. And boy did I give that bad guy a walloping, by the way.</p>
<p>I sure did save a lot of time doing it thusly, but it's irked me ever since. Now though, having tried a few new runs and then ditched it on Switch, this Switch 2 edition has done the trick. I'm fully back in, one Divine Beast down already and I'm 100% gonna see it all this time. So yeah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, to answer the question, with all its fancy new bells and whistles and sexy frame rates.</p>
<p>I'll also give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, which I'm enjoying way more than Mario's brand of racing right now. It really does pack some depth for racers who push it into the higher difficulties, and may well actually be my favourite anti-grav racer outside of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/wipeout_3">Wipeout</a> series now, and definitely replaces <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/redout">Redout</a> as my fave on Switch consoles. It's so fast, Ricky Bobby!</p>

<p>2K and Hangar 13 are putting the finishing touches on Mafia: The Old Country ahead of the imminent launch. The game will be the first new entry in the franchise since 2016's Mafia III, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-iii-fastest-selling-game-2ks-history-reviews-anomaly/">sold</a> relatively well but was not at all well received among fans. Afterward, they released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> in 2020, a remake of the original game.</p>



<p>The first rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-mafia-4-will-follow-the-story-of-don-salieri-in-sicily/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared</a> in 2022, when insider ShpeshalNick said the new game would follow the story of Don Salieri's rise in Sicily. The insider was right about the setting<span>&nbsp;but not about the protagonist, but we'll dive into that later. The development team officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of a new game project&nbsp;</span>later that year, during the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the Mafia IP. But it wasn't until two years later, at Gamescom 2024, that Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-mafia-the-old-country-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Mafia: The Old Country - Release date, platforms, pricing, editions<br></h2>

<p>As suggested earlier, the rumors were correct about Hangar 13 going back to the roots of the organization. Mafia: The OId Country takes place around 1900 in Sicily, Italy, in the fictional town of San Celeste, which was previously seen in Mafia II.</p>



<p>However, the protagonist won't be a younger Don Salieri. Instead, players will step into the shoes of Enzo Favara, a young man who spent his adolescence being forced to work in the island's sulfur mines. Now that he has a chance to prove himself to the rising Torrisi crime family, he will do anything in his power to hold on to this opportunity and defend the Torrisi from rival families who would want to see them fall.</p>



<p>The development team stressed the importance of delivering authenticity when recreating turn-of-the-20th-century Sicily, and it isn't just talk, either. They partnered with Stormind (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-tormented-fathers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remothered: Tormented Fathers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-broken-porcelain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/batora-lost-haven-bathing-in-shadows-to-reach-dim-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batora: Lost Haven</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>), which is based in Catania, Sicily, to ensure that.</p>



<p>Genre-wise, this is shaping up to be a fairly straightforward third-person single player action/adventure game. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>In the words of Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes, Mafia: The Old Country is both a return to the roots of the franchise and a step forward. He's referring to the fact that the game won't feature a plethora of side content like the full-fledged open world Mafia III. That said, The Old Country will be completely linear and won't offer an open world at all, whereas even the original Mafia allowed exploration of the city of Lost Heaven, despite the lack of anything truly meaningful to do. So, do not expect to be able to explore as much as in the previous games. This time around, Hangar 13 is betting everything on delivering a powerful, cinematic narrative.</p>



<p>Of course, this is no walking simulator. There will be plenty of action between story beats, with players engaging in tense life-or-death fights up close with a blade or from afar with various firearms, including authentic period handguns, rifles, and shotguns. There's third-person cover-based gunplay, too. Stealth is also very much a tool in Enzo Favara's arsenal, provided he can get close enough to perform a takedown move. In fact, Hangar 13 said they designed the game around a certain scarcity of resources, so being tactical with the approach to fights is highly recommended.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country is set in a variety of Sicilian landscapes, ranging from underground crypts and crumbling ruins to lush vineyards and opulent opera houses. Travel between point A and B can happen on horseback or while driving in authentic turn-of-the-century cars, and the trailers have already shown that these segments can include combat, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-mafia-the-old-country-pc-system-requirements">Mafia: The Old Country PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>The new Mafia game is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology, in a shift from the proprietary Fusion Engine seen in Mafia III and Mafia: Definitive Edition (itself an evolution of Mafia II's Illusion Engine). </p>



<p>PC store pages have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/">listed</a> the following minimum and recommended PC system requirements for Mafia: The Old Country:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum</strong>:<br>OS: Windows 10 / 11<br>Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X / Intel Core i7-9700K<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / NVIDIA RTX 2070<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 55 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.

<figure><a title="Darkside - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef74a8fc241e9/darkside-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last time, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_konga_2_hit_song_parade">Donkey Konga 2</a> for the GameCube; a rather lovely sequel that never quite became the hit it deserved to be. In a classic three-way brawl, Japan came out on top with 47% of the vote, but goodness, it was close. North America just missed out with 46% of the vote - oof! Europe sadly lagged behind with just 8%.</p>
<p>This week, we're feeling the excitement in the air as Capcom begins to lift the lid on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Yes, it's skipping the Switch 2, but regardless, we're thrilled to see a new entry return to the decimated landscape of Raccoon City.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0hkvsqt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, we're going to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_darkside_chronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>, the Wii sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_umbrella_chronicles">The Umbrella Chronicles</a> that partially retells the events of RE2 and RE: Code Veronica. Europe and Japan share almost identical box arts this week other than very minor character placements, so we'll be grouping those two together for the sake of this battle.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:7253 @ 1751223110 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Darkside - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6a59c8757ca4/darkside-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/803-resident-evil-the-darkside-chroniclesey-konga-2">Capcom / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American approach feels a bit more, shall we say, "traditional". Its got Leon and Claire front and centre, with Krauser and, uh, Leon ominously floating about in the background. It's a cool image, but honestly, we kinda wish Capcom had leaned into the 'Operation Javier' stuff a bit more. But we also understand that putting the main protagonists from RE2 smack bang in the middle will probably get more eyes on it.</p>
<h2>Europe / Japan</h2>

<p>Yes, Europe and Japan's box arts are slightly different... <em>SLIGHTLY</em>. Not enough for us though, sorry. They're basically the same, with a cool broken glass effect going on to separate the characters around the edge. It's a bit more abstract than the North American approach, and arguably better represents the segmented structure of the game itself. The lighter tones kind of remind us or the original GamCube box art for RE0 too.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-resident-evil-the-darkside-chronicles]]></content:encoded>

<p>Zion investigates</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch 2 has been out for almost a month now and while Nintendo already shared an official chart confirming the compatibility of certain Switch accessories, our American-based senior video producer Zion Grassl has now gone a step further with a video reminder.</p>
<p>He's been testing various first and third-party Switch accessories with Nintendo's new hybrid system and has now shared this handy video of what does and doesn't work on the Switch 2. There's even some stuff that <em>kind of</em> works, but still has some setbacks. If you want the full rundown, check out the video above.</p>
<p>We've also highlighted <em>some</em> of the items that will and won't work below.</p>
<p><strong>(Mostly) won't work on the Switch 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Official Nintendo Adjustable Charging Stand</li>
<li>Original Switch Dock</li>
<li>Genki Covert Dock (charging but no output)</li>
<li>MicroSD Card (will only transfer photos and video, Switch 2 uses MicroSD Express Card)</li>
<li>Switch cases, but some cases and packs can still fit a Switch 2 (PDP Sheikah Slate case, HORI adventure packs)</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch console grips (Satisfye etc)</li>
<li>Joy-Con grip holder, straps, charging standing, charging grip, and wheels do not work with Joy-Con 2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will work on Switch 2 (with a few caveats):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original Switch Joy-Con (can't be attached to the system)</li>
<li>Original Switch Pro Controller, select Power-A Controllers, select fight sticks, Poké Ball Plus (won't wake console up from sleep)</li>
<li>Ring Fit Adventure accessories (Joy-Con 2 works appear to work with game)</li>
<li>Nintendo Labo works on Switch 2 (system tablet too big for Labo VR Goggles)</li>
<li>Switch 2 can be charged with Switch AC adapter (can't power Switch 2 Dock)</li>
<li>USB Network Adapter (use the built-in ethernet port instead)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, this is just a selection of items tested, and you can find out more about what Switch accessories will and won't work with the Switch 2 in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>A USB camera fix and more</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many Sega games released alongside the Switch 2 at launch was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a>.</p>
<p>Although it arguably didn't offer much for returning players, there was a new camera feature allowing you to superimpose your face during gameplay. It seems there were some display issues with "certain" USB cameras, but this now been resolved in the latest update.</p>
<p>Along with this fix are some other updates, resolving various issues. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h3>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S – Ver. 1.0.2 (27th June 2025)</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes video display problems that could affect certain USB cameras.</li>
<li>Fixes matchmaking issues that could occur with promotion battles.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes.</li>
</ul></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And in case you missed it, yes - you can use regular USB cameras with your Switch 2 to enjoy certain features in select titles. The game also includes Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>As for our thoughts on Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, we gave it six out of ten. While it's a "pretty darn decent game" the Switch 2 additions are minimal at best, and there's no upgrade path like certain other third-party releases.</p>

<p>"Throw down anytime, anywhere"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During the Switch 2 Direct in April, 2K announced it would be bringing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k">WWE 2K</a> series to the new hybrid system at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Now, in an update from the official 'WWE games' social media account, it's been revealed a "WWE2K25 announcement" is apparently "coming soon". The trailer signs off with a familiar sound effect and animation, along with the following date: <strong>1st July</strong> <strong>2025</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You never know when the next match will begin… Be ready to throw down anytime, anywhere. #WWE2K25 Announcement coming soon"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When 2K originally revealed it was bringing WWE 2K to the Switch 2, it also announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k">NBA 2K</a> would be released on the platform as well. This follows the release of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a> on the platform and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is also expected in the future.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-tests-out-switch-2s-free-switch-game-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-digital-foundry-tests-out-switch-2s-free-switch-game-upgrades.1231098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The team at Digital Foundry has been investigating <em>every</em> aspect of the Switch 2 and they've now taken a look at the free Switch game upgrades for the new system. These were delivered by Nintendo at launch and included frame rate and resolution improvements as well as other updates enhancing the overall experience.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's John Linneman and Oliver Mackenzie tested a handful of these games in their latest video – starting with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> (which had patchy performance on the Switch), these games now run at a consistent 60FPS at higher resolutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's borderline like a free remaster, it genuinely feels like something they [Nintendo] could have released for a price, and I'm glad they didn't."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s free upgrade has also been positively received – with the resolution in docked going from "about a dynamic 900p" to a "dynamic 1800p". As for the frame rate, it's now "locked" at 60FPS, with no drops.</p>
<p>Moving onto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, there's a jump from a dynamic 1080p resolution to 4K in docked mode, and performance is now 60FPS across the <em>entire</em> game, including the city hub. As for handheld mode, you can expect 1080p with 60FPS performance.</p>
<p>The results for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> are also "pretty darn impressive", according to the team at DF. Bowser's Fury, in particular, runs at a dynamic 1800p, with improvements to shadow map resolution, and the frame rate is now "locked" at 60FPS in docked. And in handheld there's also a "huge" step up, with the title now 60FPS and 1080p.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad</a> goes from 1080p to 1440p on Switch 2 in docked (and 1080p in handheld) and performance remains consistent at 60FPS. As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>, it's now 4K docked and 1080p in portable mode, with 60FPS performance "all around".</p>
<p>Overall, though, Digital Foundry thinks every update here is a "really nice upgrade" and Nintendo has done an "awesome job" considering how they've been made available for free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Most of the upgrades are pretty significant and in some cases it actually like fixes the game, the two top down Zelda games are the best example of actually solving major technical flaws the original games exhibited, those flaws are gone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> are also labelled as being perhaps the "most substantial" free upgrades of the lot (you can find out more about this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-review-for-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-on-switch-2">in our previous story</a>). We've mostly highlighted the frame rate and resolutions of these upgrades, but Digital Foundry's video dives much deeper and also discusses HDR support and how it's been applied to these Switch titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>Guess the leakers were in a rush to show it off</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Yes, yes, you're reading that headline right. Yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> leak has taken place, if you can believe it, showing 15 whole minutes of the game that we all know exists but hasn't really been shown off in an official capacity. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leak in March</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">even just last week</a>, which might have confirmed the presence of a battle royale mode. This latest leak offers something new though: the return of Rush mode, a mode that's appeared in a number of previous Battlefield entries.
</p>
<p>
The footage in question, which originated from the Chinese social media site bilibili, keeps getting taken down given that this is very obviously meant to be under NDA and not something the general public is meant to see. So, I'm not going to link to it anywhere, because inevitably whatever clip I do share here will be gone by the time I wake up tomorrow (here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">link to a Reddit page</a> where the footage was available at one point, just for some amount of evidence). The footage in question shows off pretty much what you'd expect from a Battlefield game, i.e. unrealistic combat scenarios, destructible environments, commentary from gamers getting annoyed at other people but truthfully more at themselves due to their inner turmoil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of how this version of Rush might be different from previous incarnations, I honestly can't say. I've not played any Battlefield games, it all just looks like your typical military <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> to me. From what I can tell a majority of the footage is from the perspective of the attacking team - Rush generally sees a team of attackers, who have a limited number of respawns, go against defenders, who have an unlimited number of respawns, the former trying to detonate two charges in the latter's base.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that this is all a work in progress, some of the vehicles aren't finished for example, and there's always the chance the mode doesn't make it into the full release. In any case, this is your regular reminder that NDAs will never stop gamers from sharing clips online.

            <p>
You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-terraria-collab-is-coming-this-summer-though-i-have-some-questions-about-it">put the Terraria in Palworld</a>, but can you put the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>? Well, uh, yes, apparently. Earlier this week Palworld's Tides of Terraria update was released unto the world, adding in things like fishing, a new trust mechanic, and obviously some Terraria themed bits like monsters to fight and items to get. Now, in a <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-june-2025.143573/#tmod">post shared on the Terraria forums</a>, a new look at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's next update, version 1.4.5, showed off its own Palworld update.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I should note that not much was shown off from the Palworld additions, but it was confirmed to be arriving with the next update. A GIF was also included in the post showing a new pet companion, Digtoise, a Pal that looks as if Blastoise and Bowser had a baby. Digtoise can, as its name suggests, can dig into the ground, adding blocks of dirt and presumably other materials to your inventory. 
</p>
<p>
The forum post also notes that the team is "working in secret to bring some of your favorite Pals to life in the world of Terraria! What other Pals might appear? What other Palworld content might you see? Who knows?" I'm assuming they know at the very least!
</p>
<p>
In terms of non-Palworld related things coming in the update, there's some new furniture sets coming, notably some fancy ones. Nothing that exciting, but more stuff is more stuff.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, the post made one other thing clear: "we still do not have a release date to give out. Every day is one day closer, of course, but we are trying to remain overly cautious and conservative in regards to giving out any timing. We do not want to repeat the mistake of giving out a timing window and then have things change and it not be accurate. So, we must once again ask for your continued patience as we do the hard work that needs to be done in order to ensure a quality update for everyone."
</p>
<p>
It also notes that everything is moving along as fast as it can without making the team crunch on it, but completely ruled that out, which is a refreshing thing to hear at this point honestly. I'm sure it'll be ready when it's ready!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a> are a developer who more likely than not, you'll think of as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting</a> game studio. I wouldn't blame you, they're the folks behind Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Persona 4 Arena, all really beloved fighting games. That doesn't paint a full picture though, and in a showcase held yesterday, they showed off a bunch of upcoming games, some of which they made themselves, others they're serving as publisher for. And not one fighting game in sight! Which plenty of people made comments about, but I think those people maybe need to play anything other than a fighting game for once.
</p>

<p>
First up is possibly the most exciting announcement of the bunch, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt4ojxXBIck">Dear me, I was</a>, a dialogueless interactive adventure game that unfortunately isn't coming to PC but I need to make mention of. That's because Taisuke Kanasaki, the director and artist of Hotel Dusk and Another Code, is serving as art director on this project, with Maho Taguchi serving as director. Kanasaki's art is instantly recogniseable, so I've got my fingers tightly crossed it'll make its way to PC.

<p>
There was also a showcase for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyhbM6DtET8">Double Dragon Revive</a>, a new take on the classic side-scrolling beat-em-up, which is coming to PC for those looking for a dose of nostalgia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv5WxE-kLGM">Demon's Night Fever</a> is a currently platformless new stylish seeming "raising speedrun simulation RPG based on the concept of 'embrace being evil'" from Disgaea creator Sohei Niikawa. Kind of obsessed with whatever that explanation is, also hoping this one comes to PC. And there's a new Bubble Bobble called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2937770/Bubble_Bobble_Sugar_Dungeons/">Sugar Dungeons</a>! Can't go wrong there, and this one is coming to PC. All of these are being published by Arc System Works.
</p>
<p>
Then, lastly, there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2ZvFP36M0">Damon and Baby</a>, an isometric action game where you play as a Demon King who's been cursed to be stuck to a human child, which Arc System Works is developing. Not much of this one was shown off, and again, no platforms were confirmed for this one, but it's how Guilty Gear creator Daisuke Ishiwatari introduced it that I think is worth highlighting.
</p>
<p>
Right off the bat he noted how the "game market is tough now. To overcome that, Arc System Works has launched a new project." He goes on to say how he knows that most people recognise the studio as a fighting game company, but to "achieve a new brand where we are known for quality mid-range action games, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games."
</p>
<p>
He notes how because of the fact that both ends of the AAA blockbuster and indie spectrum can find a lot of success, there's more risk for companies to create new series. "This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future, a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes, and to accumulate technology and know-how."
</p>

Ishiwatari points out how Guilty Gear started out as a small-scale project, and has gone on to be a much bigger series. So he hopes that by making more mid-range titles, there'll be more opportunities for many more games and creators of games.
</p>
<p>
Quite honestly, hearing something like this is a breath of fresh air. I love an indie game, and I can enjoy the odd AAA title, but nothing gets me going like a mid-range, AA game (looking at you, Remedy). More importantly, attempting to create an environment where younger developers can learn and improve their skills to perhaps one day make something bigger and bolder is ridiculously needed. 
</p>
<p>
With all of the layoffs that have taken place, there's so many skilled developers being forcefully ousted, leaving little room for junior staff members to come in and work their way up. I've got my fingers crossed for Arc System Works' initiative, and hope to see more of it from other studios too.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s In the Jungle DLC has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>We saw our first peek of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">In the Jungle at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Described as a new story DLC for the underwater exploration/sushi restaurant management game, the brief teaser confirmed at the time that In the Jungle will launch at some point in late 2025. Sadly, though, that timescale has slipped.</p>
<p>The update was part of a 10-minute video that covered DLC availability, pricing, and confirmed Dave the Diver is now available on the Epic Games Store worldwide. It also revealed a free upgrade for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners was also on the way.</p>

<p>"The upcoming In the Jungle DLC takes place in a brand new region," explained director and head of Mintrocket Studio, Jaeho Hwang, "and we are working hard to make sure it brings fresh excitement to the game." Hwang then shared an all new peek, which you can see at 4m20s in the video above.</p>
<p>"The village here is where they'll be staying during their adventure. And this is a lake at the village. Here we are finally adding freshwater fish to capture and cook, just like many of you've been waiting for. We hope you guys are excited about it.</p>
<p>"One sad news, though. Although we announced it as late 2025, unfortunately, we might need to delay it a little bit to early 2026 to add more exciting content. There are still so many cool ideas that we don't want to miss floating around in the dev team. We'll share more soon and we'll keep you posted on the release date as soon as it's fixed."</p>
<p>Hwang also reflected on the pricing and limited-time exclusivity of the Ichiban's Holidays DLC.</p>
<p>"We know that recently we let some of you down," he admitted. "This kind of approach is sometimes requested when working with large IP holders to help protect the value of their IP. Still, we thought that it would be worth delivering cool new content, so we decided to release the DLC with a six-month time window. However, many players expressed disappointment with some riaising concerns about how it felt like 'FOMO' marketing.</p>
<p>"Although this was not our intention at all, we completely understand that perspective," Hwang added. "We want to apologise to everyone who felt let down."</p>
<p>Hwang said that after passing the feedback back to Sega, the IP holder, the team is now able to extend the DLC's availability. Now, the Ichiban's Holiday DLC will be available on all platforms until the end of not just 2025, but the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Godzilla DLC pack - which was free but only available last year - has also made a comeback. You can grab it right now across all platforms, and it'll stay "free and available" until the end of next year, too.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Feedback also intimated to the team that the price "felt high for the amount of content provided".</p>
<p>"I admit that we were not thoughtful enough about the pricing," he said. "So we will be providing regular discounts to let you pick it up at a more reasonable price." Right now, at the time of writing, you can pick it up for 50 percent off.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver has previously seen DLC add-ons that add extra cosmetics, a free Dredge collaboration and... Godzilla. We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-developer-confirms-story-dlc-in-the-works-and-talks-spin-offs-for-each-character">knew that bigger story DLC for Dave the Diver was coming</a> - but not what it was or when it would land.</p>
<p>"Wholesome, harmonious and completely unwilling to settle," is how our Christian Donlan described the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">Eurogamer's Dave the Diver review</a>, "this is one of the most generous games in years."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For all you Space Wolves lovers out there, a batch of brand new models are joining the pack! We previously <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-army-set-preview-awoooo" rel="nofollow">covered the new Space Wolves Army Set</a>, and now Games Workshop has sent us new releases hitting preorder to check out! Read on for our quick thoughts on all the models releasing soon.</p>

<h2>Space Wolves: Logan Grimnar</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-grimnar.jpg?itok=qHOaYaZZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-grimnar.jpg?itok=5GUbNeX8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Logan Grimnar is one of the longest-serving Chapter Masters in the Imperium, and his feats of strength, resolve, and incredible charisma make him one of the most famed figures in the galaxy. This Epic Hero can lead a unit of Wolf Guard Terminators.</p>

<p>Armed with a Storm Bolter and his famed Axe Morkai, he also fights alongside a pair of snarling wolves, who add their fangs and claws to his arsenal of attacks!</p>

<p>His abilities mess with the rules of the game in a way I find pretty exciting and novel - his first ability allows him to bring in units in Strategic Reserve as though it were one round later than it actually is in the game (that's a cool ability we don't see much of!). His second abilitiy increases the CP cost by 1 of enemy units that get targeted by commands.</p>

<p>These aren't necessarily bomb abilities that will decimate your foes, but... that's what his Axe Morkai is for with it's -2 AP and high damage output!</p>

<h2>Space Wolves: Arjac Rockfist</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-arjac.jpg?itok=_QXNBBx4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-arjac.jpg?itok=ugz-3zuu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Arjac Rockfist first came to Logan Grimnar's attention as an Iron Priest by beating back hordes of Kraken Spawn, now he stands by Grimar's side as one of his Champions. A towering mass of muscle, Arjac's clad in Terminator Armor and can be attached as a leader to a unit of Wolf Guard Terminators.</p>

<p>His weapon, Foehammer, has Anti-Monster 3+, Anti-Vehicle 3+, and Assault (as Ranged) and Precision (as Melee) keywords, and can be be used as a ranged or melee weapon. Easy to hit with (it has a WS 2+ and a BS 2+), it has a -2 AP and deals 3 damage per hit.</p>

<p>Abilities-wise, he lets you roll to let models in his unit fight one last time before dying (if they haven't already fought), and he can re-roll all to hit and to wound rolls against characters. This is one of those aggressive leaders you really want in the front line, turning a unit of Wolf Guard Terminators into character hunters.</p>

<p>I really like the way this model can be built either with hammer in hand, or chucking it across the battlefield. This is the kind of dynamic and dramatic posing we love to see from our Epic Hero characters.</p>

<h2>Space Wolves: Njal Stormcaller</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-stormcaller.jpg?itok=xKd1LzFH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-stormcaller.jpg?itok=ZKxMchGe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Njal Stormcaller is the Space Wolves' greatest psyker, controlling the skies above! Another Epic Hero, he can be attached to a unit of Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers!</p>

<p>Because of his psychic ability, he can send out crackling lightning as a Ranged attack, and has some seriously cool Psychic abilities. First, his ability Wind Walker gives a unit he's attached to the Assault keyword, and says when making an Advance roll that you don't have to roll, you automatically move 6". I love the flavor of this, as he calls forth gusts of freezing wind to help speed his unit across the battlefield.</p>

<p>His second ability allows you to target a unit hit by his Ranged attack, making them "stormwracked" which means that the range of their Ranged weapons are shortened by 6" (for a minimum of 12"). In other words, once you hit an enemy unit with a psychic storm power, a torrent of bad weather surrounds them limiting their visibility. That's just... so damn cool - there's no more refined way of saying it!</p>

<h2>Space Wolves: Wolf Guard Terminators</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-terminators.jpg?itok=CzEj0ND8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-terminators.jpg?itok=iR6UTxtJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wolf Guard Terminators bring everything you'd expect from a squad of Terminators. With Master-crafted power weapons and options for power fists, assault cannons and storm bolters, these are your heavy duty meat and potatoes so I won't spend too much time talking about them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their special ability, Rugged Resilience, is interesting - as it reads: "Each time an attack targets this unit, if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than the Toughness characteristic of this unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll." Subtracting 1 from the Wound roll can be pretty brutal when you're desperately trying to chip away at a hearty unit like a pack of Terminators!</p>

<p>I do love the look of these Terminators, who can eschew helmets for their classic Space Wolves beards and braided locks. It's nice to break up the usual look of Space Marines, and I'll&nbsp; take some variance wherever I can get it.</p>

<h2>Space Marines: Drop Pods</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-space-marines-drop-pods.jpg?itok=Qmg_zMZA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-space-marines-drop-pods.jpg?itok=wG2BNFSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, we're getting an updated sculpt for Space Marines Drop Pods, which GW says will make rulings on its actual size more clear-cut. I like this new sculpt, the size certainly feels right to me. And the design with the embarkment bridges down looks really nice on the battlefield. GW also says this new version is easier to build, but I never built the older version so I can't really speak to that!</p>

<h2>Space Wolves New Releases - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I think the approach to our three new sculpts and rules for our Epic Heroes really stand out. I don't run a Space Wolves army myself, but if I did I think I'd work to find room for all three in my list. I really like both the look and the rules for Njal, who I think might be the standout here. It's just so evocative - you're literally calling forth the skies above to create horrible storms to rain down on your enemies. That's seriously so rad.</p>

<p>Obviously if you're running Space Wolves you've probably already decided whether these are right for your list or not, but if you're on the fence on which new army to start, I think you'd be in pretty good shape to pick up the Army Set and a few of these Epic Heroes.</p>
