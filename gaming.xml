			<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is filled to the brim with powerful enemies, but very few can compete with Bayle the Dread, one of the most fearsome dragons created by FromSoftware. Taking down this enemy is rather difficult, but you can make your life easier in several different ways.</p>
<p>Bayle the Dread is fought at the summit of the Jagged Peak, which can be reached easily by climbing the mountain. The location is pretty linear, so simply following the main path will allow you to reach the summit. However, you will have to fight two bosses, the Jagged Peak Drake and the Ancient Dragon Senessax, on the way, so be prepared for some intense fights. Also, make sure to speak with Igon at Pillar Path Waypoint, read Igon's message at the Dragon Pit Terminus, visit the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion to speak with the Dragon Priestess to be able to summon Igon during the Bayle fight and receive his gear when the Dread has been defeated.</p>
<p>Preparation is extremely important to have an easier time against Bayle the Dread in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. For starters, the boss is meant to be some sort of ultimate challenge, and so its difficulty is on par with that of the boss of Enir-Ilim. For this reason, it's best to attempt to take down the dragon after improving the Scadutree Blessing as much as possible and level up Vigor to at least 60, as the dragon hits extremely hard and can one-shot you with some of its attacks. To increase your survivability, equip Boltdrake and Flamedrake Talismans to increase Fire and Lighting damage reduction. If your build allows you to use it, the Ancient Dragon Hunter's Great Katana is an excellent weapon to use, thanks to its Weapon Skill, Dragonwound Slash, which unleashes a powerful ranged attack with its charged version that can be easily directed at the dragon's head by simply locking onto it. If you have no means of hitting the dragon's head consistently, you will have to attack the damaged leg. Hitting any other part of the body will deal lower damage, making the battle longer than it should and increasing the chance of your defeat in the process.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp; - Bayle the Dread First Phase</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240625010439_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As soon as you cross the fog wall, before doing anything else, you should summon Igon by interacting with his sign by the arena's entrance. As the NPC is summoned when the battle has already begun, Bayle's HP will not increase, so he can be a pretty decent help. Also, you need to summon him to complete his quest, so make sure to always do so.</p>
<p>Once Igon has been summoned, you may want to use your Spirit Ashes summon to get an extra helping hand. As Bayle is pretty aggressive, you will have to do so during one of the same windows of opportunities you will use to attack the dragon, so after the breath attacks, the bite attack, which is signaled by a glow in the dragon's mouth, or after he has performed the spinning tail attack.</p>
<p>The first phase of the fight is actually pretty easy to get through if you're careful. Instead of locking onto the boss, wait for the dragon to come closer to you and get under its body to attack the damaged leg. The vast majority of times, you can attack the leg a couple of times, get away to avoid the breath attack, rinse and repeat. The timing to avoid the breath attack is pretty strict, so do not dodge roll unless you are at light equipment load. If the dragon is targeting Igon, doing this is even easier, as Bayle won't even attempt to retaliate with one of his breath attacks.</p>
<p>If you're using a ranged or magic build, you will have to watch out for more attacks. Thankfully, they are rather telegraphed and somewhat easy to avoid. The first breath attack, which shoots a beam of fire and lighting straight at you, can be avoided by running to the side, while the other with the advancing flames can be avoided by rolling into it. The aforementioned tail-spinning attack can be recognized by the dragon's stepping back and can be easily avoided by dodging it as well. The crashing down attack, which comes after Bayle leaps in the air, can be avoided by dodging into it as well, but refrain from attacking for too long, as this attack has low recovery, and you risk getting hit if you overextend.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp; - Bayle the Dread Second Phase</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240626115335_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you have depleted half of his life, the second phase of the fight will begin. During this, Bayle will often fly around the arena to unleash hell on you. Avoiding the projectiles from the air and the ground attacks is simple enough, but you will have to be even more careful when approaching him to attack or when healing. In phase 2, staying below the dragon to attack his damaged leg is still a viable strategy, possibly even so, but his attack patterns become faster and more unpredictable, so never get greedy unless you are sure your next flurry of attacks will take the boss down.</p>
<p>Once you have defeated Bayle the Dread, you will get the Bayle's Heart item, which can be traded at the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion for Bayle's Flame Lightning or Bayle's Tyranny. In the area, you can also pick the Priestess Heart, which can be used to turn into a dragon when unrobed, and the Flowerstone Gavel weapon.</p>

        <p>Ghost of Tsushima and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door debuted as the top earners on their respective platforms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Fortnite continues to lead Newzoo's revenue and user engagement charts for May, having topped both the previous month.</p>
<p>This is according to the research firm's monthly engagement and revenue charts for games across PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch across six markets including the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>The Top five for both charts remained the same as in April, being led by Fortnite followed by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, 3, and Warzone 2.0, Minecraft, Roblox, and Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's free-to-play shooter XDefiant, which launched on May 21 following a closed beta, jumped the charts from No.33 to No.6 in terms of monthly active users.</p>
<p>The Top 20 revenue earners featured two new releases, including the PC port of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima in fifth place and Nintendo's remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in sixth place.</p>
<p>Both games debuted in first place on their respective platform charts, with Newzoo acknowledging that Ghost of Tsushima's release on PC boosted sales on PlayStation as well.</p>
<p>Elden Ring also rose 17 places in the overall revenue ranking, with its revenue increasing across all platforms prior to the release of its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC on June 21.</p>
<p>Here are the Top 20 games by monthly active users across US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy for May, across PC and consoles, according to Newzoo:</p>

<p>A dataminer has leaked upcoming DLC characters for Mortal Kombat 1, which is said to include Terminators T-1000.</p>



<p>According to the leaker interloko via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=566SCksuvtk&amp;ab_channel=Interloko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, six upcoming characters will soon be coming to Mortal Kombat 1. While the leaker says that the information is “100% confirmed” in his video, it should be stressed that this information has been datamined and has the potential to not be released. That being said, the six characters include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyrax</li>



<li>Sektor</li>



<li>Noob Saibot</li>



<li>Ghostface</li>



<li>Conan the Barbarian</li>



<li>T-1000</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to the six characters, the leaker also found references to five new game announcers and two brand-new arenas.</p>



<p>In September 2023, dataminers had already found <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-ghostface-halloween/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code references </a>to Ghost Face, which Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon teased in a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1707508202638602342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a>. Back then, the same dataminer who found references to Ghost Face also found references for Noob Saibot, Cyrax, and Conan the Barbarian. </p>



<p>The recent findings could suggest that the characters are nearing a release.</p>



<p>What do you think of the potential six brand-new characters coming to Mortal Kombat 1? And who are you most anticipated to see? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>The human body is a wonderfully complex organism, and it’s well worth trusting your instincts when it comes to feeling repulsed by certain things. We know that if the milk looks bad and smells bad, it is bad. Do not taste the forbidden yogurt, as much as it calls to you. How, then, to interpret my visceral repulsion to the most disgusting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> build yet seen? So gross, in fact, that YouTuber SYROBE has managed to beat the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> DLC’s infamously ridiculous final boss in a mere 13 seconds. Here’s the video. Massive spoilers, obviously.</p>

<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v20jFYM0nLI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The build uses the lightning variant of the new perfume bottle weapon - specifically, its ash of war ability Rolling Sparks. SYROBE credits the weapon classes’ multiple exploding hitboxes for its silly damage potential, and says the ash of war condenses these usually diffuse hitboxes into a single area when aimed downwards. He’s also got the maximum Scadutree blessing, which boosts his stats in the DLC area. Rounding the build off are a bevvy of buffs from equipment, such as the black dumpling hat, the madness talisman, and the lightning cracked tear. He’s done the math, basically, and the math is sickening.</p>
<p>After breaking down the build, SYROBE completes his victory lap by melting the final boss of the DLC in a world record 13 seconds. Coincidentally, that’s also my own record for how long I can last against the same boss without getting pounded into the dirt. </p>
<p>It’s early days yet, but this sort of discovery does suggest that Shadow Of The Erdtree’s increased difficulty comes alongside various ways to mitigate it aside from the more apparent Scadutree fragments. Might the players who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">found the DLC too obnoxious</a> change their minds now? Is Mizayaki having a crack at his sweatier fans by making the most powerful weapon yet seen a gentle nod to always pack deodorant? Will this inspire me to try a different weapon to the same greatsword I’ve been using for twenty hours now? Who knows!</p>

            <p>
A patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings.
</p>
<p>
The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.
</p>
<p>
Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.

<p>

After that, the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased (there is a fixed number of fragments to collect).
</p>
<p>
The difficulty of the DLC has been a major talking point since its release, in particular players finding the quest initially too difficult and then struggling with the final boss. This balance revision should assist players in both regards.
</p>
<p>
The patch also addresses graphics settings on PC, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">players complained on Steam of performance issues</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">patch notes</a> confirm a bug has been found where ray tracing settings are automatically enabled when loading saved data from a previous version of the game.
</p>
<p>
Further, if the frame rate is unstable, it's recommended to check if ray tracing is enabled in the system menu and set this to off.
</p>
<p>
Future patches will offer other balance adjustments (including enemy difficulty in NG+), fix bugs, and update performance.
</p>
<p>
Elden Ring publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-publisher-calls-out-shadow-of-the-erdtree-players-struggling-with-the-difficulty">Bandai Namco previously suggested struggling players focus on levelling up their Blessings</a>, but this new patch is a more direct change.

</p>
<p>
The release of the DLC has provided a fresh reason for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamers-continue-to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-weird-and-wonderful-ways">streamers to play the game in weird and wonderful ways</a>, including with their mind.

			<p>One of the main complaints <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-user-reviews-are-mixed-citing-excessive-difficulty-and-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading to 'Mixed' user reviews</a> for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the expansion's supposed unbalance. As if to answer users' complaints, developer FromSoftware has released Calibration update 1.12.2, tweaking the scaling of Shadow Realm Blessings as detailed below.</p>
<p><em>Attack and damage negation curve scaling of the&nbsp;<b>Shadow Realm Blessings</b>&nbsp;have been revised.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of&nbsp;<b>Blessing enhancements</b>, and the second half will now be more gradual.</em></li>
<li><em>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The calibration update can be applied by logging into the multiplayer server.</em></p>
<p><em>If the Calibration Ver. listed at the bottom right of the title menu is not "1.12.2", then select LOGIN and apply the latest regulations before enjoying the game.</em></p>
<p>Granted, this is a relatively small change, and FromSoftware is fully aware of that. The patch notes for Calibration update 1.12.2 end with a mention of further balance changes and bug fixes coming in a future Shadow of the Erdtree update.</p>
<p>Additionally, the developers said there is a bug where sometimes loading a save from a previous version of Elden Ring will enable ray tracing on PC. Check your graphics settings to confirm whether it has been incorrectly enabled on your system.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree may have gotten a lukewarm reception from some users, but it still received excellent reviews from critics. Our Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it a perfect score</a>:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world.</em></p>

			<p>Nearly a year after its September 2023 launch, Counter-Strike 2 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4257672198473442891?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> the first batch of community maps. Thera and Mills have been added to the Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch map groups, Memento and Assembly to the Wingman map pool, and Pool Day to the Arms Race map pool.</p>
<p>This Counter-Strike 2 update also makes it easier to gain badges and improves the MVP panel, with Premier matches getting a new animated panel. Finally, a bunch of new graphics-related settings (including a dedicated frame pacing option) are available for tweaking, as detailed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings Recommendations</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if your display's refresh rate is set below its maximum at startup. Using your display's highest refresh rate is generally recommended.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync support is detected but not enabled at startup. Using G-Sync is generally recommended if your system supports it.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync is enabled but not V-Sync and/or NVIDIA Reflex. It is generally recommended to enable all three settings together when they are available. Note that applying these settings will limit your frame rate to your display's refresh rate or slightly lower, which is usually the smoothest-looking and lowest input latency settings combination.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Removed "Main Menu Background Scenery" and "Item Inspect Background Scenery" settings from the Video Settings page. These settings are still available on the Main Menu and in the Item Inspect screens respectively.</em></li>
<li><em>The "Refresh Rate" setting now shows your display's current refresh rate in Windowed and Fullscreen Windowed modes.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the "Laptop Power Savings" setting which has never actually been configurable in CS2.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a "Frame Pacing" section to the Advanced Video settings page.</em></li>
<li><em>Added an "NVIDIA G-Sync" row to the Frame Pacing section which tells you whether or not G-Sync is active with your current display settings. This row may be hidden if you're using the Vulkan renderer or if you're not using an NVIDIA graphics card.</em></li>
<li><em>Added "Maximum FPS In Game" and "Maximum FPS In Menus" sliders to the Frame Pacing section. These control the fps_max and fps_max_ui convars respectively.</em></li>
<li><em>Increased the default "Maximum FPS In Menus" setting from 120 FPS to 200 FPS.</em></li>
<li><em>The Advanced Video visual preview now uses the "In Game" maximum FPS instead of the "In Menus" maximum</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Counter-Strike 2 remains the most popular game on Steam, with the exception of rare peaks like PUBG and <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-6-million-units-in-4-days-passes-1-5-million-concurrent-steam-players-puredarks-fsr3-mod-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palworld</a>. In the last 24 hours, Valve's competitive first-person shooter game registered a peak of 1.37 million players, over twice as many as the second game (Dota 2, also made by Valve).</p>

  <p id="s5niyx">The original Windows PC version of Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil</em> is now available through digital storefront GOG, letting PC players experience the groundbreaking survival horror classic as it was back in 1996. PC versions of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/21/18187446/resident-evil-2-history-capcom-hideki-kamiya"><em>Resident Evil 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/18/21027264/resident-evil-3-was-a-spin-off-until-capcom-changed-its-mind-at-the-last-minute"><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em></a> are also getting a re-release through GOG, the company announced Wednesday.</p>
<p id="Vy8s59">The re-release of <em>Resident Evil</em> for PC includes all of its original content with “quality of life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern systems.” As with other PC releases through GOG, <em>Resident Evil</em>’s PC version is DRM-free.</p>
<p id="ohJw7S">Additionally, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> are available to wishlist through GOG, and available for pre-purchase in a trilogy bundle.</p>
<p id="hlyWeD">The original <em>Resident Evil</em> was released first for PlayStation in 1996. Capcom later ported the game to Windows, a release that included uncensored footage not available in the original PlayStation version. The PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> also had two additional unlockable weapons: the Ingram submachine gun for Jill Valentine and Minimi light machine gun for Chris Redfield. Jill and Chris also got PC-exclusive unlockable costumes.</p>

<p id="6xVXCB">Capcom’s 2002 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/19/7550887/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-playstation-4-360-3">remake of <em>Resident Evil</em> has been available on Windows PC</a> for nearly a decade now. But the classic PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> has been stuck on CD-ROM format for much longer, though unofficial downloads of the game are readily available. The GOG release will be a legitimate and official way to acquire the PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> and, eventually, its 1998 and 1999 sequels.</p>
<p id="rQk0av"><em>Resident Evil 2</em>’s PC version was based on the PlayStation “Dual Shock Ver.” re-release of the game, and included high-resolution character models and an art gallery. <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> for PC also featured enhanced 3D character models and higher-resolution graphics, but was dinged by players for its keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p id="GVDJPW">Capcom has remade the first four mainline games in the Resident Evil franchise over the past two decades, but the GOG re-releases will give survival horror fans a chance to replay the originals in their original, tank-controlled forms, albeit with some modern conveniences.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Yesterday, Dr Disrespect posted a statement on social media confirming that the recent allegations are true – he was banned from Twitch in 2020 for inappropriately messaging a minor in 2017. In the lengthy statement, Dr Disrespect set the story straight and explained that this won’t end him and that after an extended vacation, he’ll be back and raring to go, insinuating that he’s immune to ‘cancel culture’.</p>



<p>However, in the hours that followed the publishing of his statement, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm lost tens of thousands of followers across YouTube and Twitter, with the downturn gathering pace over time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-support-that">Can’t Support That</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s statement</a> may have done more harm than good. It cleared things up, but it confirmed that in 2017, he was knowingly and inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch. As the bombshell hit social media, Beahm’s closest creator friends shared messages and videos, most of them weighing heavily on the side of giving up on the charismatic, brash creator. </p>



<p>The likes of TimTheTatman and NICKMERCS spoke harshly against Dr Disrespect, stressing that there’s no excuse for his behaviour and that they can’t continue to support him going forward. These are streamers who Dr Disrespect has gamed with for years, and their statements are indicative of his support network crumbling around him.</p>



<p>Between Twitter and YouTube, Dr Disrespect lost around 30,000 followers as soon as his statement was released, and the expectation is that the number will continue to rise leading into the weekend. At the time of writing, Dr Disrespect had 4.71 million YouTube subscribers and 2.5 million Twitter followers, but it’s safe to assume that vast swathes of those followers are made up of bots and dead accounts.</p>



<p>Every content creator who is ‘somebody’ is speaking on this news, and the sentiment isn’t good for Dr Disrespect. He’s taking an extended vacation from streaming, but when he returns, he might find that there’s not much to come back to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24186178/acolyte-how-many-episodes-list<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0mgBax"><em>The Acolyte</em> has never been exactly clear on what kind of Star Wars story it’s telling. Is it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading">one of an ex-Jedi</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24177229/acolyte-master-who-is-answer">the Sith reborn</a>, an important origin story, or just a brief little adventure to introduce the world to the High Republic in live-action? The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181235/star-wars-acolyte-mae-master-jedi-force-choke-origin">true answer is likely somewhere in between</a>, but we’ve got a few more episodes left before we know for sure. </p>
<p id="27NZcy">While it certainly seems like the show is on the verge of ending near the conclusion of episode 5, the series actually has a total of eight episodes. </p>
<p id="hlilnC">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The rest of this post contains slight spoilers for <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em>.]</p>
<p id="ugN0k6"><em>The Acolyte</em> started out with a simple question: who is killing all these Jedi? That question, however, was answered in the first episode. Since then it’s raised concerns about a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24185141/star-wars-acolyte-master-mask-donnie-darko-design">mysteriously masked master of the Force</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176253/star-wars-acolyte-mae-osha-force-cult-witches">Force-sensitive Covens</a>, a Sith guy’s right to practice the Dark Side in peace and teach it to other people, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181315/star-wars-acolyte-justice-for-kelnacca">daily life of a Wookiee Jedi exile</a>, and more. But by the end of episode 5, all of that has pretty much come to a close. </p>
<p id="fAuN1k">Instead, it seems like the last three episodes of the show (about an hour to 90 minutes of total runtime if the rest of the show is any indication) are going to be about Mae and Osha swapping places. Up until now, Mae has been a pretty clear vision of the Dark Side of the Force; she’s animated by her anger and strong emotions, she tries to kill her sister, and one way or another the fire she sets gets everyone she loves killed. Meanwhile, Osha is the picture of good Light Side behavior — even if she isn’t a Jedi anymore. She trusts in the Jedi and their way of doing things, she seems eager to avoid violence, and she certainly doesn’t approve of Mae’s quest for revenge. But that isn’t to say that either character has to stay that way for the whole show.</p>
<p id="ly5ZFx">Who knows, maybe this is a set up for the two to trade sides, with Mae joining the Jedi and Osha teaming up with the Dark Side — an anti-redemption arc could be a nice change of pace for modern Star Wars. Or maybe, with Osha captured, Mae will be forced to join the Jedi in taking down her master? Either way, the show’s go three more episodes to do something. </p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/23906339/austin-butler-the-bikeriders</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-one-has-ever-been-prettier-than-austin-butler-in-the-bikeriders.911415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23906339/austin-butler-the-bikeriders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="ChaK0S"><small><em>This essay on </em></small><small>The Bikeriders</small><small><em> was originally written for the film’s European premiere at the 2023 BFI London Film Festival. It has been updated for the movie’s theatrical release.</em></small></p>
<p id="yhRMEM">Elvis Presley’s sadly unfulfilled ambition for his movie career was to be the next James Dean. So it’s an ironic coincidence that Austin Butler, after playing Elvis in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23180048/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-tom-hanks-austin-butler">2022’s Best Picture Oscar nominee <em>Elvis</em></a>, should now take direct aim at the kind of simmering yet poised, unutterably cool and devastatingly handsome role that James Dean typified in the 1950s — and score a bullseye. He <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24097767/dune-2-stilgar-austin-butler-javier-bardem-feyd-rautha">brought a particularly creepy animal magnetism to <em>Dune: Part Two</em></a>, but it is absolutely ridiculous how good he looks in <em>The Bikeriders</em>.</p>
<p id="Hj7oSE">The movie is a motorcycle-gang drama set in the 1960s, starring Butler as Benny, a laconic yet hotheaded member of a Chicago biker club, the Vandals. As Benny, Butler has artfully mussed, greased blonde hair and a scruffy goatee. He wears many layers of frayed, often sleeveless denim and leather, and rings on most of his fingers. He smokes. He plays pool. He leans on things a lot. He’s a man of few words who mostly mooches around the scene lankily, or stares into the middle distance with moody intensity. But sometimes he bursts into violent action.</p>
<p id="nuDMFM">And of course he rides a huge, growling chopper. (Be sure to see <em>The Bikeriders </em>in the loudest theater you can find, if you want to feel every bark and roar from the bikes, and every swooning Shangri-Las needle drop in your ribcage.) He has a signature move where he rides his bike one-handed in an absurdly cool, offhand way, like this:</p>

Director Jeff Nichols (<em>Mud</em>, <em>Midnight Special</em>) first saw the book 20 years ago and had been thinking about adapting it for a long time, because of its themes of masculinity and identity, but also because it looked so cool. So does his movie. So does Austin Butler.</p>

<p id="YGLYia"><em>The Bikeriders</em> is a familiar, <em>Goodfellas</em>-like tale of working-class, outsider men in midcentury America looking for brotherhood and a sense of belonging, and eventually being eaten up by corruption and violence. But Butler isn’t our garrulous, fast-talking guide to this world, like Ray Liotta’s Henry Hill. He’s the stillness at the center of the movie. The chatty voice-over that propels the story actually comes from his wife, Kathy, played (with an absolutely outrageous Chicago accent) by Jodie Comer.</p>

<p id="VKDCx7">Alongside Comer, the heavy-lift, capital-A acting in <em>The Bikeriders</em> is done by Tom Hardy as gang boss Johnny. Hardy does that quizzical, menacing-yet-soulful, raspy-voiced thing that he’s so good at. Johnny loves Benny in a way that’s both touching and a little scary. In their scenes together, Butler just stands there almost silently and soaks Hardy’s intensity up. It ought to be too passive and one-sided, but instead it’s magnetic, because of Butler’s presence, his quelled energy, his burning eyes, and his <em>Oh my God just look at that hair</em>.</p>

<p id="QmMLqQ">Butler has the least to do of the movie’s triumvirate of leads, and his character is the simplest, to the point of being more of an icon than a real person. But it doesn’t matter. If <em>Elvis</em> left you in any doubt, <em>The Bikeriders </em>seals it: This guy is a movie star, and this is a movie-star performance. He never looks less than amazing, and his sheer magnetism draws the rest of the film into his orbit.</p>
<p id="2gJqKf"><em>The Bikeriders </em>is a film of old-fashioned, simple pleasures: great tunes, perfect costumes, myth-making shots, and a cast of great character actors really going for it. (Including, but not limited to, Michael Shannon, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22827455/west-side-story-review-steven-spielberg"><em>West Side Story</em></a>’s Mike Faist, <em>Justified</em>’s Damon Herriman, and a completely unrecognizable Norman Reedus as a shaggy Californian wildman biker.) It’s a film about looking at the gorgeous, unknowable people on the screen — and that one gorgeous, unknowable person in particular — just as Hardy’s character does at one point with Marlon Brando in <em>The Wild One</em>, and thinking: <em>What would it be like to </em>be<em> them? </em></p>

  <p id="0eWnPA">At the end of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24177229/acolyte-master-who-is-answer">last week’s <em>Acolyte</em>, the Master showed up</a> and proved to everyone that they mean business, effortlessly casting everybody on the Light side of the Force away with the flick of a wrist. This week, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181423/plo-koon-acolyte-dave-filoni"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> picks up right from there, showing us the true power of the Sith Lord (and surprised Sol doesn’t remember him... before finally revealing his identity). Of course, we didn’t need to see the Master in action to know how ferocious a Sith Lord they were. Their look told us enough.</p>
<p id="sf9mMo">As you might expect, that’s by design for Jennifer Bryan, the costume designer for <em>The Acolyte</em>. When designing the mask with Star Wars creature design veteran Neal Scanlan, they knew that it had to be in line with the aesthetics of the Star Wars Dark Side, while also feeling like something new. </p>
<p id="CGR67u">“My department had many concepts because, for the character, everything has to look symbiotic; masks, cloak, everything has to work together,” Bryan tells Polygon, noting how grateful she is for the high degree of collaboration between Star Wars departments. The goal, as with many Sith, was simple: Communicate danger. </p>

<p id="eU6nsL">“It needed to be threatening. It needed to be dark. And it needed to be something you never ever saw before, but there was something familiar about it.” </p>
<p id="vuKYyf">There was some hammering out of details; Bryan says earlier mockups emphasized different parts of the face, like the eyes. But to the final point, she drew from two specific sources: She gave the helmet a flare at the base of the neck, to evoke (who else) Darth Vader. “It will unconsciously register [with] the audience that this is a guy you need to watch your back with,” she says, naming him and Darth Maul as two points of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a> inspiration. </p>
<p id="5CxGyL">But the defining feature — that toothy, Venom-like grin — came from a different place altogether. </p>
<p id="GnJ3x0">“Leslye [Headland, <em>The Acolyte</em>’s showrunner] says she thought about the bad bunny in <em>Donnie Darko</em>,” Bryan says. “There was something kind of grotesque about that. [...] I think the idea Leslye wanted was for you to get a sense of dread when [you] see this character up close finally.” </p>

<p id="kMNW7P">That sort of communication of character was key even before we knew who the Master was.  By the time we find out that Manny Jacinto’s Qimir is actually the Sith Lord the Jedi have been chasing all along, Bryan wanted us to get a certain sense of Qimir as a guy hiding in plain sight. </p>
<p id="Wa0aG3">“The first time we see him [...] he basically hijacked that apothecary shop, and he’s wearing the shopkeeper’s clothes to kind of blend into the community. And he wears that for quite a bit,” Bryan says. “We didn’t want to give it away, that anything that he’s going to be anything other than himself. So when you first see him he’s [...] a little hustler.” </p>
<p id="WR2bST">The goal was, even when he was in disguise, to be able to get a read of how devious he is: “You know, he’s wily, he’s slippery. He thinks on his feet.”</p>

Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - the acclaimed Atari-themed interactive museum from developer Digital Eclipse - is adding 39 new games later this year in an expansion detailing further events in the company's eventful history.
</p>
<p>
Atari 50's Expanded Edition introduces two new timelines to the existing game, starting with The Wider World of Atari. This features 19 playable games, eight new video segments, plus "interviews, vintage ads, historical artefacts, and more" focusing on a broad range topics. 
</p>
<p>
"Highlights from the new timeline," explains Atari, "include a deep dive into Stern Electronics' robot-blasting Berzerk; unusual and underappreciated innovations and hidden gems from the late 1980s; a spotlight on the artist Evelyn Seto, who helped create the iconic 'Fuji' Atari logo; Pong creator Al Alcorn explaining the birth of Breakout; and an exploration of the fan base's role in discovering unreleased prototypes, creating 'homebrew' games, and preserving Atari history."

<p>
As for the Expanded Edition's second new timeline, that's called The First Console War and it details the long-running rivalry between the Atari 2600 and Mattel's Intellivision - a brand Atari <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">notably purchased back in May</a>, securing the rights to over 200 games at the same time. This segment promises six video segments and 20 playable games, including a selection of M Network games, a mix of Atari and M Network sports games, plus rare Atari 2600 and 5200 prototypes. 
</p>
<p>
Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Expanded Edition will be available as a digital standalone release and as DLC for the existing version of the game. Both launch for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC on 25th October, with PS5 and Switch also getting a physical version of the Expanded Edition. 
</p>
<p>
Atari hasn't yet detailed the full list of 39 games included in Atari 50's Expanded Edition (which will be available in addition to 103 base game titles and 12 retro games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-50s-acclaimed-interactive-museum-just-added-12-more-games-in-free-update">added in a free update last year</a>), but expect more details in the run up to its release.

                <p>With Valve's big Steam Summer Sale kicking off this Thursday, now is a great time to look at getting a Steam Deck, as you can pick one up a 64GB model <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">for under $300 until July 11</a>, or a far beefier 512GB version of $381, if you don't mind LCD screens. Not too bad! And you will of course want some games to play on it, which is where this new Fanatical bundle deal kicks in.</p><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-handheld-heroes-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fadd-a-bunch-of-steam-deck-games-to-your-backlog-for-cheap-with-the-handheld-heroes-bundle%2F1100-6524494%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Handheld Heroes promotion</a> lets you build your own bundle of games, with the selection on offer having a Steam Deck Verified or Playable status. As a reminder, games with a Verified label are good to go as soon as you've installed them on your Steam Deck, while games labeled as Playable may possibly need a bit of tinkering in the settings menu to run optimally (not always, though).</p><h2>Fanatical Handheld Heroes Bundle Deal</h2><ul><li>Looper Tactics</li><li>Istanbul: Digital Edition</li><li>Transport Fever</li><li>Trinity Fusion</li><li>God Of Weapons</li><li>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</li><li>Beyond The Edge Of Owlsgard</li><li>Hidden Cats Triple Pack</li><li>The Crackpet Show</li><li>Dust &amp; Neon</li><li>Dishonored 2</li><li>Cookie Cutter</li><li>Pan'orama</li><li>Strayed Lights</li><li>Quake II</li><li>The Invisible Hand</li></ul><p>You can get two games for $7, three games for $10, or five games for $15. Once you eclipse five games, you'll still only pay $3 per game. If you wanted to buy every game listed here, you'd pay a total of $48 for 16 games.p</p><p>The list of eligible games is pretty solid. Some of the standouts include Cookie Cutter, which launched late last year. This is a cool metroidvania with an irreverent sense of humor, as you take control of the android Cherry on her rage-filled and love-driven quest to save her creator. There's also a great selection of Bethesda-published games--Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, Dishonored 2, and Quake 2--action-packed rogue-lite The Crackpet Show, and some fluid combat to master in Strayed Lights.</p><p>Another great deal at Fanatical right now is the <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fadd-a-bunch-of-steam-deck-games-to-your-backlog-for-cheap-with-the-handheld-heroes-bundle%2F1100-6524494%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</a></strong>. This includes the aforementioned Bethesda games as well plenty more in the Elder Scrolls, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, and Quake universes. The best part? These Bethesda games are all being sold as codes that can be redeemed on GOG, so you're getting DRM-free games. Steam Deck owners can still play most of the games in the bundle after a bit of tinkering in desktop mode. We'd recommend the Heroic Games Launcher, which combines GOG, Epic, and Amazon's Prime Games app.</p><p>You can also check out the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate/">GOG Summer Sale</a></strong> for even more DRM-free deals and <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-8000-pc-games-discounted-in-new-fanatical-sale-that-also-includes-freebies/1100-6524318/" data-ref-id="1100-6524318">Fanatical's Red Hot Sale</a></strong> for discounts on thousands of Steam games if you spend $12 or more.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime members</a> can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-free-games-prime-day-2024/1100-6524480/" data-ref-id="1100-6524480">claim a bunch of free PC games</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-amazon-prime-day-2024/1100-6524467/" data-ref-id="1100-6524467">Prime Day 2024</a>, which runs July 16-17.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/he%E2%80%99s-probably-not-cooked.911376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2020, Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, near the height of his fame, suddenly got banned from Twitch. At the time, the livestreaming giant did not provide a reason. The Twitch community was baffled. This set off a chain reaction of reporters – myself included – digging desperately to unearth the cause of Beahm’s sudden exile. For years, however, authentic confirmation <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proved impossible to come by</a>. Then, last Friday, a former Twitch employee just <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676?s=46&amp;t=Rn7xcNFl_Ef44gaalMlwdA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted it out</a>. A couple follow up reports from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/youtuber-dr-disrespect-was-allegedly-kicked-off-twitch-for-messaging-minor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> later, Beahm <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to everything</a> on Twitter.</p><p>The former Twitch employee’s tweets, as well as the reports, backed up a story I’d heard from several secondhand sources over the years: Beahm exchanged explicit messages with a minor via Twitch’s DM-like “whisper” system in 2017. When Twitch caught wind of this years after the fact in 2020, the company moved swiftly to ban him. This, in part, is why the explanation was so hard to verify: Sources have told me over the years that Twitch did not execute Beahm’s ban through standard channels, and only a small handful of employees were present when the decision was made. Documentation was also exceedingly scant. Without access to firsthand sources – who could have given away their identity simply by being the lone person out of such a small group to speak – these accusations were too severe to publish. They did not pass legal muster and involved a victim who could potentially be endangered, which left reporters in the difficult situation of knowing about something without being able to state it publicly. What followed was a long, frustrating holding pattern.</p><p>When former Twitch employee Cody Conners tweeted about the reason for the ban on Friday, the machine whirred back to life. Though Conners was not a firsthand source, a version of the story was out there, which motivated sources with actual knowledge of the situation to speak more candidly. After that, dominos fell in short order. Midnight Society, the video game developer Beahm helped found, <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut ties with him yesterday</a>. Today, Beahm addressed the accusations.</p><p>"Lets cut the fucking bullshit, as you know there's no filter with me,” <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> the 42-year-old streamer who’d spent previous days <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/dr-disrespect-ban-allegation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denying all wrongdoing</a> and previous months accusing Twitch of being “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/dr-disrespect-calls-twitch-slithery-disgusting-purple-snakes-but-still-doesnt-explain-why-he-was-permanently-banned-from-the-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slithery disgusting purple snakes</a>” for banning him. “Were there Twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.”</p><p>Beahm went on to take responsibility from a “moral standpoint,” saying that he never should have “entertained these conversations to begin with” as an “adult, a husband, and a father,” but then later on he vociferously decried claims that this makes him a “fucking predator or pedophile.” And despite grandiose proclamations about potentially driving off “into the sunset” <a href="https://x.com/AnneMunition/status/1805336527498789087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a stream yesterday</a>, he added in his statement that he’s “not fucking going anywhere.” Instead, he’s going to go on an “extended” vacation with his family and then resume doing his thing.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this raises the question: Is Dr Disrespect cooked? Yes and no.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies will want to distance themselves from him. Some already have. In addition to Midnight Society, Turtle Beach – which partnered with Beahm on a headset and whose logo he displayed prominently during his streams – has removed all mentions of him from its website. “We will not be continuing our partnership with Guy Beahm/DrDisRespect,” a Turtle Beach representative told Aftermath. A representative of FanDuel, another company whose logo adorns Beahm’s streams, told Aftermath that its agreement with Beahm ended in May. Over the years, Beahm has also partnered with larger, more mainstream organizations like the San Francisco 49ers and Mountain Dew, the latter of which told Bloomberg that it hasn’t worked with him “in some time.” While I do not have inside information here, I would be extremely surprised if either organization decided to collaborate with him again in the future. Big companies have a line when it comes to scandals, and indiscretions involving minors tend to cross it.</p><p>But ardent Dr Disrespect fans – as well as the portion of the Twitter commentariat that always appears during moments like these as though cursed by the gods with the Sisyphian task of defending every predator ever to walk the earth – have repeatedly sought to discredit claims against their favorite middle-aged man who yells at video games. At every turn, they’ve asked for more evidence, even as companies with a vested financial interest in keeping Beahm around have conducted their own investigations and dropped him. The truth is, no amount of evidence will ever satisfy these people. If reporters manage to confirm documentation that’s been circulating through back channels, fans will say it’s falsified. If the DMs in question leak, they’ll probably say those are fake too – or that they’re not actually that bad, or some other variation on that theme. If the victim comes forward, they’ll be harassed endlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>These fans will continue working ‘round the clock to discredit claims against a man they perceive to be Their Boy, who in turn barely perceives them at all. In his own way, Beahm has joined them, copping to the substance of the allegations but vehemently denying the severity. He just had a little grooming, as a treat. It was mutual, even though a minor cannot consent. It is somehow not the same thing as predation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other big content creators have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56611614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of grooming</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dobrik#Vlog_Squad_sexual_assault_allegations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">additional scandalous actions</a>. Despite this, they have maintained sizable fandoms. And this isn’t even Beahm’s first rodeo, though previous incidents were nowhere near as severe. In 2017 he was caught cheating on his wife and had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/popular-streamer-dr-disrespect-says-he-was-unfaithful-t-1821311237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly apologize while out of character</a>. In 2019 he and his crew <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-streams-inside-an-e3-bathroom-gets-banne-1835428982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought a camera into an E3 bathroom</a> and filmed others without their permission, in violation of both Twitch’s rules and, potentially, the law. Diehard fans barely batted an eyelash. Many ate it up.&nbsp;</p><p>This is part of a larger pattern online. Content creators with sufficiently large audiences get near-infinite chances. In part, it’s the reason platforms like Kick and Rumble exist. They provide a home to content creators who’ve taken things too far on or off Twitch; they keep streamers around despite <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/adin-ross-andrew-tate-white-supremacists-1234705845/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overt racism, sexism, and homophobia</a> and even after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ice-poseidon-sam-pepper-sex-worker-arrest-australia-kick-stream-rcna117961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incidents that nearly constitute crimes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with that said, Kick is much more ban-happy than it was during its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-03/twitch-s-new-video-game-streaming-rival-kick-goes-light-on-moderation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laissez faire early days</a>, and it recently <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/zherka-heelmikes-kick-bans-for-allegedly-soliciting-minors-are-irreversible-2775197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned two streamers for allegedly soliciting minors</a>. On top of that, YouTube, Beahm’s current platform of choice, has yet to comment on his actions and may not even ban or discipline him. There is a very real chance that, whenever Beahm decides to return from vacation, we might be looking at a business-as-usual situation on the world’s biggest online video platform.&nbsp;</p><p>But the Kick ecosystem is evidence that certain audiences accept – and even applaud – boundary-pushing behavior in defiance of social norms and acceptable treatment of others. On Kick, Rumble, and in certain corners of YouTube, there’s something akin to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYTSPS0AplM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an alternate universe of streamers</a>, one that grew out of Twitch’s earlier, edgier tendencies but which that company has since sought to squelch. The core appeal of these creators <em>is </em>their ability to get away with shit. To harass and bother, to say the most out-of-pocket things they can think of, to push limits until all lines in the sand have eroded.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s obvious trainwreck appeal here, but some fans also look to these creators aspirationally, as a sort of avatar. If a big content creator can embrace an unhinged lifestyle and get whatever they want, maybe viewers can too. These sorts of viewers will always support somebody like Beahm, a 42-year-old man who behaves like a 16-year-old boy, because they see themselves in him. And though Beahm will probably lose viewership over this in aggregate regardless of whether he stays on YouTube or ends up somewhere else, the viewers who stick around will likely become bigger fans than ever. Because ultimately, this is not about morals or principles; it’s about people forming such a strong attachment to a creator that they feel like attacks against him are attacks against them as well and platforms that recognize they’ll make more money than they’ll lose by harnessing that ugly energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So Dr Disrespect is cooked in that he’s losing deals, sponsors, and an entire company, as well as his reputation as somebody who has <em>not </em>engaged in inappropriate conversation with a minor, a stunningly low bar to clear. He’s cooked in the mainstream sense. But he’s made a calculation that he can step away, take a breather, and return to an online audience large enough to continue supporting him. And he’s probably right.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following a series of allegations from former Twitch employees last week, high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has admitted he was permanently banned from Twitch in 2020 after exchanging "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".
</p>
<p>
The allegations first surfaced last Friday, when Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product [and] was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon." A subsequent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">report by The Verge</a> explicitly linked the allegations to Beahm after speaking with two former Twitch employees.
</p>
<p>
The reason for Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">permanent Twitch ban</a> - which occurred roughly halfway through his two-year exclusivity contract with the company in 2020 - has long remained a mystery. And even after last week's allegations surfaced, Beahm avoided addressing them explicitly, insisting he bound by was "legal obligations" relating to his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-settles-legal-dispute-with-twitch-over-2020-permanent-ban">August 2021 settlement with Twitch</a>. "I didn't do anything wrong," he added, "all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."
</p>
<p>
Now, however, after being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">ousted from Midnight Society</a> - the game development studio he co-founded in 2021 - Beahm has addressed the allegations head on, admitting to exchanging messages with a minor in 2017 but insisting there were no "real intentions" behind them.
</p>
<p>
"Let's cut the fucking bullshit, as you know there's no filter with me," Beahm wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">lengthy, sometimes combative statement</a> shared on social media. "I've always been up front and real with you guys on anything that I can be up front about, and I'm always willing to accept responsibility... which is why I'm here now."
</p>
<p>
"First and foremost I do want to apologise to everyone in my community as well as those close to me, my team, and everyone at Midnight Society Game Studio.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of people have been left in the dark about what happened yesterday with Midnight Society and I, and we made the painful decision collectively, to have me step down. Our team is full of incredibly talented and good people that have high career ambitions and families and I'd never want jeopardise the culture we have carefully crafted.
</p>
<p>
"Everyone has been wanting to know why I was banned from Twitch, but for reasons outside of my control, I was not allowed to say anything for the last several years. Now that two former Twitch employees have publicly disclosed the accusations, I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban.
</p>
<p>
"Were there Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with Twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.
</p>
<p>
"Now, from a moral standpoint I'll absolutely take responsibility. I should have never entertained these conversations to begin with. That's on me. That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father. It should have never happened. I get it. I'm not perfect and I'll fucking own my shit. This was stupid.
</p>
<p>
"Now, with all this said, don't get it fucking mistaken, I’ve seen all the remarks and labels being throw around so loosely. Social media is a destruction zone. I'm no fucking predator or pedophile. Are you kidding me? Anyone that truly knows me fucking knows where I stand on those things with those types of people. Fuck that. That's a different level of disgust that I fucking hate even hearing about. Don't be labelling me as the worst of the worst with your exaggerations. Get the fuck outta here with that shit.
</p>
<p>
"But I think I've said what I needed to say regarding the ban itself. That's it.  That's why Twitch made the decision in 2020.
</p>
<p>
"To my team, community, industry friends that have supported me, I apologise, I wish I could've said all this sooner.  You guys have always showed me and my family love and support throughout all these years we love you guys like you can't imagine. I have the fucking best community and circle. If any of this has made you uncomfortable, I get it. You don't have to support me anymore but just know you have always been greatly appreciated.  
</p>
<p>
"But trust me when I say this... to all my haters that live and breath social media with zero real life experience, I don't give a fuck about you.
 
Finally, if you're uncomfortable with this entire statement and think I'm a piece of shit, that's fine. But I'm not fucking going anywhere. I'm not the same guy that made this mistake all those years ago. I'm taking an extended vacation with my family as mentioned on stream and I'm coming back with a heavy weight off my shoulders."
</p>
<p>
"They want me to disappear...," Beahm concluded, "yeah fucking right."
</p>
<p>
Following Beahm's statement, Midnight Society co-founder Robert Bowling took to social media with a <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">message of his own</a>. "If you inappropriately message a minor," he wrote, "I cannot work with you. Period. I promised to only act on facts, and I did."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, gaming headset and accessories company Turtle Beach has confirmed the end of its long-running partnership with Beahm in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">statement to IGN</a>.

        <p>Its DLC disappears from sale today</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> is my favourite racing game of all time, and a gloriously daft celebration of going fast set in a stunning, pastoral recreation of the UK. If you haven't played it, you should buy it quick - because it's being delisted from digital storefronts later this year, and its DLC disappears from sale today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a familiar story. Due to expiring licenses, Forza Horizon 4 will be removed from sale on December 15th, 2024. 
</p>
<p>That's the bad news. The good news is that the game will remain playable after that date, including its "offline, online and multiplayer features", according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1293830/view/4185613970227394261">the announcement explaining the delisting</a>.
</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 4's multiplayer content cycles through events in a system called the "Festival Playlist". The final series, Series 77, will begin today and ends on August 22nd. After that, the playlist screen will become inacecssible. Daily and weekly challenges will continue, however, so that players can earn Backstage Passes, with which players will be able to unlock cars previously exclusive to Festival Playlists.
</p>
<p>I like Forza Horizon 4 more than Horizon 5, mostly because it's set in a funland version of my actual home and because it lets me race trains and hovercraft through sheep farms and down hillsides. It's also a game I've returned to several times, playing over from the beginning, and I suspect that's something I'll want to do again one day. It would be terrible if it became completely unplayable, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">Ubisoft's open world racing game The Crew did earlier this year</a>. 
</p>
<p>Playground Games say that Forza Horizon 4 will receive various discounts between now and December, and it's already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/">80% reduced over on Steam</a>. A bargain.</p>

Igon’s quest takes you to the top of Jagged Peak, where you’ll battle one of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s toughest bosses, the dragon <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23950050"><strong>Bayle the Dread</strong></a>.</p>
<p id="slnRd7">Beyond that, completing Igon’s quest requires taking down multiple drakes and dragons. You’ll also need to acquire the item <strong>Thiollier’s Concoction</strong> from the NPC Thiollier to receive certain optional rewards from another NPC, <strong>Dragon Communion Priestess</strong>.</p>
<p id="Mq7yLi">In this <em>Elden Ring</em> guide, we’ll show you every step of Igon’s quest, including whether you should use Thiollier’s Concoction or not when meeting with the Dragon Communion Priestess at Grand Altar of Dragon Communion.</p>

<p id="5zwCk4">Igon can be found resting (and loudly screaming in pain) just west of the <strong>Pillar Path Waypoint</strong> <strong> Site of Grace</strong> in east Gravesite Plain. Talk to him, and you’ll learn about his hatred of Bayle the Dread. Exhaust Igon’s dialogue and continue to head south.</p>
<p id="mWijIN">Shortly after encountering Igon, you’ll be invaded by the <strong>Ancient Dragon-Man</strong> spirit. Defeat the invader and continue south until you reach the <strong>Dragon’s Pit dungeon</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="mWQCur"><strong>How to complete Dragon’s Pit dungeon</strong></h2>
<p id="0De7b7">After entering the dungeon, you’ll discover a new site of grace, the Dragon’s Pit. This dungeon cave is filled with Skeletal Beastman who will ambush you and resurrect after being struck down. Dragon’s Pit is also home to a Magma Wyrm who will drop a Dragon Heart and Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone when defeated.</p>
<p id="VNAdDw">Escaping the Dragon’s Pit requires taking a leap of faith into a huge open pit in front of a candlelit altar. Jumping into the pit is safe, and will lead you to a dungeon boss fight against the physical form of Ancient Dragon-Man.</p>

<p id="0CUN4x">After speaking with the Dragon Communion Priestess, head back north to the Jagged Peak Drake arena, then northeast, up the mountain, and across a bridge to reach the Foot of the Jagged Peak site. Continue further up the mountain until you reach a pair of drakes battling each other.</p>
<p id="WBoK2y">Simply wait on the outskirts of the battle until one of the drakes dies and the other is sufficiently injured by the deceased drake. Defeat the remaining drake to receive a Dragon Heart, a Dragonscale Flesh, and a large number of runes.</p>
<p id="MJIaZk">After the battle, you’ll see Igon again just to the east of the drake duo boss arena. Speak to him and he’ll give you <strong>Igon’s Furled Finger</strong>, an item that will let you summon Igon during the battle against Bayle the Dread. You don’t need to equip Igon’s Furled Finger; simply having it in your inventory will make the <strong>Drake Warrior Igon summon sign</strong> appear in the Bayle fight.</p>
<hr id="3SuFO4">
<h2 id="Gef5V8">
<strong>Defeat Ancient Dragon Senessax</strong> </h2>
<p id="H2CX2G">After speaking with Igon, continue heading east and even further up the Jagged Peak mountain, utilizing spirit springs and avoiding an environmental danger: giant rolling boulders.</p>
<p id="ToVO3r">Eventually, you’ll encounter <strong>Ancient Dragon Senessax</strong> on your ride up Jagged Peak mountain. This fire-breathing and lightning-channeling ancient dragon will feel familiar if you’ve previously faced Lichdragon Fortissax and Ancient Dragon Lansseax. Stay on Torrent for as long as you can in the battle against Ancient Dragon Senessax, utilizing the steed’s quick movement to get behind the dragon and to double jump over its ground-based lightning attacks.</p>
<p id="Ponjly">Defeating Ancient Dragon Senessax will reward you with an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone and a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.</p>

<p id="U8opPA">After the Ancient Dragon Senessax battle, continue to head up Jagged Peak, riding three more spirit springs to reach the summit. You’ll find one more site of grace, Jagged Peak Summit, which is located just outside of the Bayle the Dread boss arena.</p>
<p id="fkLSRu">If you want to summon Drake Warrior Igon, you’ll have to do so from within the arena itself, after you’ve passed through the mist wall. The Drake Warrior Igon gold summon sign is immediately to the left when entering Bayle’s arena.</p>
<p id="rVCSZ0">You’ll likely need all the help you can get when facing Bayle the Dread, a boss battle that will test your skill and your patience with <em>Elden Ring</em>’s camera. Since Bayle uses plenty of fire-based attacks, equip your best fire protection. You should also use your Ancient Dragon’s Blessing to reduce your damage intake, and use any frost- or scarlet rot-inflicting weapons you have to whittle down Bayle’s health. If you’re struggling, our guide on how to beat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23950050">Bayle the Dread</a> can help.</p>
<p id="YFXhfI">Defeating Bayle will reward you with the <strong>Heart of Bayle</strong> item, a new type of Dragon Heart.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft insists Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in production despite having said next to nothing about it in the last four years. But while it's possible the sequel might turn out to be vaporware in the end, the original Beyond Good and Evil is back with the launch of its remastered anniversary edition. There's good news on that front, too: You can get <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fbeyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-pc&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-on-beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-on-launch-day%2F1100-6524506%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> on PC at a discount from Green Man Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">The new version of Beyond Good and Evil usually lists for $20, but using the code JUNE15, you can get it for $17 at GMG. There is one caveat worth noting, however: This code is for Ubisoft's PC platform, Ubisoft Connect, rather than Valve's Steam. The game is also included with Ubisoft's subscription service, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-on-beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-on-launch-day%2F1100-6524506%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Premium</a>. You can subscribe to the program for $18/month or $135/year--the annual membership is discounted by $35 until July 11.</p><p dir="ltr">This version of the game improves the graphics and controls and brings the 2003 title into the modern era, offering 4K resolution and 60 FPS. The audio has also been enhanced and the soundtrack has been remastered. Other improvements include a new autosave feature, cross-save, and the ability to skip cutscenes.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also new content in this version, as Ubisoft noted in its <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4HYZp0t1d14z2afFYmzjju/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-launches-on-june-25" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> about the game. A new treasure hunt system sends you across the game world to earn cosmetic rewards, while tying things in with Beyond Good and Evil 2. Ubisoft also included a new Anniversary Gallery, "which features previously unreleased art, videos, anecdotes from developers, and other never-before-seen content."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the digital releases, Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition has a physical edition on the horizon. As Ubisoft notes in its blog post, it'll be available from Limited Run Games for preorder on July 12.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not familiar with Beyond Good and Evil, you're going to want to change that. The action-adventure game is considered a classic, particularly for its art and storytelling. Back in the day, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/beyond-good-and-evil-review/1900-6085013/">Jeff Gerstmann awarded it an 8.3 in his review</a>, and it sounds like the remastered version's improvements should help with some of the original's technical issues.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the original Beyond Good and Evil has been de-listed from sale just about everywhere. There is one option if you'd rather play 2003's version over the remaster. GOG has the original, DRM-free PC edition of <a

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185972/forza-horizon-4-xbox-pc-microsoft-steam-delisted<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24055807/spec-ops-the-line-delisting-licensing-2k">delisting</a>” ax is swinging <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094536/adult-swim-games-delisted-warner-bros-discovery">once again</a>, and this time, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> is the latest major video game to be cleaved from digital storefronts. Developer Playground Games <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">announced on its site</a> that sales of the 2018 open-world racer are ending due to licensing and partner agreements, and the game will be removed from Microsoft stores and Steam on December 15th, 2024.</p><p>While the days are numbered for people to still be able to buy the game, the final in-game event will run from July 25th to August 22nd — after which, some achievements linked to the seasonal Festival Playlists will no longer be unlockable.</p><p>To add a little further confusion, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>’s DLC is being delisted beginning today. And if you played the game via Xbox Game Pass and already bought some DLC, you qualify for a token to download the full game and continue playing it after the delisting date. That game code will be sent to qualifying players who have a fully paid Xbox Game Pass subscription in the coming days and must be redeemed by June 25th, 2026.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, Playground says in its FAQ that the servers are staying on post-delisting, so both offline and online modes will remain playable. Between this and qualifying Game Pass subscribers getting a code to keep the game, it feels like Playground is trying to make the best of an unfortunate situation — one that often hits games like these with real-life car and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-does-the-games-industry-solve-its-problem-with-music-licensing">music licenses</a> — but, like with most delistings, it still remains a bit messy and convoluted.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 4</em> will be just over six years old when it’s pulled from digital stores, leaving only what’s left out there of physical Xbox copies in circulation for latecomers or preservationists to explore. Sure, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a> was a worthy successor, and the franchise is likely to continue as the more bombastic counterpart to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23905255/forza-motorsport-launch-date-first-impressions"><em>Forza Motorsport</em></a>, but I don’t think it will ever feel normal or, frankly, <em>good</em> for digital games to feel so short-lived.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> is an asymmetric horror multiplayer game, in which one player, the killer, attempts to sacrifice all the other players on the server. Now the other players could be Lara Croft, who has been added to the game's public test server in advance of a full release next month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Lara has three unique perks: Finesse, which makes her faster at vaulting; Hardened, which reveals the Killer's location when other characters would scream; and Specialist, which makes her niftier with tokens and generators. Alas, "having two pistols" is not one of her perks, so she'll have to scrabble around in the dark to survive like everyone else.
</p>
<p>You can see all the updates in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/4177732670886583216">8.1.0 PTB patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>This seems to be Lara Croft as she appears in the reboot series. Those weren't horror games, but they were certainly horror-adjacent at times, with a seemingly endless variety of graphic death animations in which Lara would, say, slip off a log into a pit of skewers. Being hung on a meathook is somewhere in the same family.
</p>
<p>While available on the PTB server now, Lara will be added as a survival in full on July 16th. </p>

So, this guide should help you provide fairly concise, easy-to-understand answers for all the Dr Disrespect questions you might be receiving from people close to you.</p><h2 id="h78700"><a id=""></a>“Who is Dr Disrespect?”</h2><p>  Herschel Guy Beahm is a 42-year-old video game streamer who previously worked with <em>Call of Duty</em> developer Sledgehammer Games from 2011 to 2015. </p><p>He began streaming full-time after leaving the studio and became famous for his “toxic gamer” character known as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/popular-battlegrounds-streamer-cries-after-fan-says-he-1819088301&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/popular-battlegrounds-streamer-cries-after-fan-says-he-1819088301">Dr Disrespect.</a></span> As “the doc,” he would often yell a lot, insulting other players, and act overly confident while playing battle royale titles like <em>PUBG</em> and <em>H1Z1</em>.  </p><h2 id="h78701"><a id=""></a>“Wait... so he was famous for yelling a lot and playing video games?”</h2><p>Well, when you put it like that it does sound really silly, but yes, that’s basically what turned Dr Disrespect into a popular streamer with millions of subscribers and fans around the world. He was also pretty good at shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em>, which helped build his audience, too. </p><h2 id="h78702"><a id=""></a>“Why does he uh...look like that?”<br></h2><p>It’s part of his schtick. Dr Disrespect is supposed to be a parody of toxic gamers mixed together with an action-hero persona, hence the headphones, sunglasses, ‘80s mullet, and red tactical vest. However, depending on who you ask, Dr Disrespect might have essentially become the very thing he parodied as he became more comfortable <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespects-shtick-takes-a-dangerous-turn-into-sprea-1843205562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespects-shtick-takes-a-dangerous-turn-into-sprea-1843205562">spreading conspiracy theories</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-calls-criticism-of-his-mock-chinese-accen-1822837251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-calls-criticism-of-his-mock-chinese-accen-1822837251">insulting people’s accents</a></span>. </p><h2 id="h78703"><a id=""></a><strong>“I saw something about a bathroom incident?”</strong></h2><p>In June 2019, Dr Disrespect was invited to E3—a large gaming trade show—and streamed live from the convention floor.

I don’t really have an answer for that part, sorry. </p><h2 id="h78704"><a id=""></a>“I’m confused, is this a character or really him?”</h2><p>That’s a great question! It’s hard to say. While it’s clear that he’s still putting on a wig and fake mustache and all the other parts of the costume, it’s become increasingly difficult to figure out where Dr Disrespect ends and Beahm begins. </p><p>We are jumping ahead a bit here, but in a recent statement about all the shit going on, he decided to write it in character. I’m not sure if this was a choice he made on purpose or just the latest example of his inability to separate reality from his popular creation. </p><h2 id="h78705"><a id=""></a>“Did he really cheat on his wife?”</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/popular-streamer-dr-disrespect-says-he-was-unfaithful-t-1821311237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/popular-streamer-dr-disrespect-says-he-was-unfaithful-t-1821311237">According to the man himself in 2017</a></span>, he was indeed “unfaithful” to his wife. </p><p>“I’m going to take some time off to focus on stupid fuckin’ mistakes,” Beahm said, “I’m going to take time off to focus on my family.” This message, it should be noted, was delivered on video out of character. </p><h2 id="h78706"><a id=""></a>“So why did he get banned from Twitch in 2020?”</h2><p>Well, for a long time very few people knew what actually happened. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitch-bans-dr-disrespect-1844182541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-bans-dr-disrespect-1844182541">On June 26, Dr Disrespect was permanently banned from Twitch</a></span>. The streamer had 4 million subscribers and was one of the biggest names on the platform. But that didn’t matter. At the time, Dr Disrespect said he didn’t know why he had been banned.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/streamer-dr-disrespect-says-hes-suing-the-fuck-out-of-t-1847554416&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/streamer-dr-disrespect-says-hes-suing-the-fuck-out-of-t-1847554416">In 2021 he filed a lawsuit</a></span> against Twitch after claiming he learned why he was banned. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That lawsuit was settled in 2022</a></span>. “I have resolved my legal dispute with Twitch,” Dr Disrespect said in a message posted to Twitter. “No party admits to any wrongdoing.” That was all we knew until this past weekend. </p><h2 id="h78707"><a id=""></a>“But now we do know because...”</h2><p>Cody Conners, a former higher-up at Twitch, broke his silence on June 21, claiming on Twitter that Dr Disrespect got banned because he “got caught sexting a minor” and trying to “meet up with her at TwitchCon.” As you might expect, this led to a firestorm online and reporters began digging and talking to sources, with <em>The Verge </em>corroborating Conners’ claim on June 23 after speaking to another Twitch employee with information about the situation.</p><h2 id="h78708"><a id=""></a>“Okay, so what has he said about all this?”</h2><p>At first, Dr Disrespect seemed to be trying to move on and hoping all this would blow over. However, as more reports came in and more people began talking about the situation, it became clear this wasn’t going away. </p><p>On June 24, the game studio he had helped create cut ties with him after it investigated the claims itself. The news of him <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-deadrop-twitch-ban-sext-1851557734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-deadrop-twitch-ban-sext-1851557734">being removed from the studio</a></span> was reportedly sent to him during an <em>Elden Ring</em> stream on Monday, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-elden-ring-dlc-stream-sext-1851559064&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-elden-ring-dlc-stream-sext-1851559064">in a clip near the end of that stream</a></span> you can see him reacting negatively to a message on his phone. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">On June 25, Dr Disrespect finally broke his silence</a></span> and issued a lengthy statement on Twitter confirming that in 2017 he’d exchanged text messages with a minor that sometimes “leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more.” </p><p>“Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not,” added the streamer. He said he didn’t send any pictures or videos and he claimed no criminal charges were ever filed.</p><h2 id="h78709"><a id=""></a>“Now what happens?”</h2><p>Well, I’m not sure! It’s possible that YouTube, where Dr Disrespect currently streams, might remove the content creator from the platform. It’s also possible he’s able to stick around. During his most recent stream, he claimed to be taking an “extended vacation” and said he was burned out by streaming and being online. </p><p>So perhaps he just vanishes into the ether. Or he comes roaring back in a few weeks on a new platform. For now, we don’t know. We’ll just have to wait to find out. </p><h2 id="h78710"><a id=""></a>“Well, what about other streamers and content creators? They aren’t controversial right?”</h2><p>lol.

The reasons why are a complex mix of social media backlash and current events.</p>

<p>On June 14, the CRIT Awards - an awards group dedicated to recognizing talented creators in the Tabletop Gaming space - announced an <a href="https://www.critawards.org/criteria-and-code-of-conduct">update to their Code of Conduct </a>via <a href="https://x.com/crit_awards/status/1801754068773441586">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). The update stated that "Individuals who identify as Zionists, promote Zionist material, or engage in activities that without a doubt support Zionism are not eligible for nomination".</p>

Much of this discussion heightened in part due to recent events in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine. Events that encompass many complex issues involving thousands of years of history and culture.</p>
<p>Last night exactly ten days after their Code of Conduct change the CRIT Awards <a href="https://twitter.com/crit_awards/status/1805397619835027501">announced</a> that they will not be attending GenCon 2024 citing safety concerns. For those planning on attending the CRIT Awards have confirmed that tickets purchased will be refunded and that any nominees are free to remove their participation in the event as they "understand the situation can be extremely mentally taxing, and difficult in many ways that may be unexpected". Lastly, the awards board will be hosting a virtual event.</p>

Voice-actor, cultural consultant, and actual play producer <a href="https://x.com/KP11Studios/status/1805520758572998680">KP Upadhyayula</a> has announced he will not be attending out of solidarity.</p>
<p>Actual play <a href="https://x.com/TransplanarRPG/status/1805633311684821500?t=KB1XyOYN-E-MTvuit7zNvg&amp;s=19"><em>Transplanar RPG</em></a> made a statement denouncing the change in the convention's programming as well as denouncing the conflation of anti-Zionism with anti-semitism. The TTRPG zine <a href="https://x.com/ApocUnlimited/status/1805457414247850435?t=9N0t9Q6eqALbGXV3yb12hQ&amp;s=19"><em>Apochromatic Unlimited</em></a> announced their support for the CRIT Awards further expanding on their views stating "do not equate Zionism with being Jewish just as we do not equate white nationalism with being white". <a href="https://www.rascal.news/">Rascal News</a> co-founder Rowan Zeoli <a href="https://x.com/RowanZeoli/status/1805402885825446055?t=8WvsyzzZ35z72iWTwUpI4Q&amp;s=19">voiced her</a> support among many others&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unclear if the CRIT Awards chose to leave the event on their own or if GenCon's managers were involved in the decision. We have reached out to both parties requesting official statements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24185907/ministry-of-ungentlemanly-warfare-guy-ritchie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="G8dIRt">British movie director Guy Ritchie loves nothing more than the collision of class and thuggery. It’s like catnip to him. In movies like <em>Snatch </em>and 2019’s <em>The Gentlemen</em>, he thrives on putting plummy toffs next to venal crims and seeing what happens — or combining the two. This is the director who turned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLuhWLNqpiA">Sherlock Holmes into a pugilist</a>, after all. His idea of Englishness encompasses the wood-paneled manor and the stinking fish market, but nothing in between. His idea of masculinity is Vinnie Jones, the foul-mouthed, brutal Cockney soccer player, but dressed like a country squire, with a hunting shotgun in the crook of his arm.</p>
<p id="XfRdHG">Ritchie has actually made all kinds of movies in all kinds of modes, from the rom-com <em>Swept Away</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2019/5/29/18644577/aladdin-guy-ritchie-arab-culture-jasmine">Disney’s live-action <em>Aladdin </em>remake</a>. But he remains defined by the tone he set in his first two films, 1998’s <em>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em> and 2000’s <em>Snatch —</em> laddish crime capers that at the time felt like a Britpop answer to Quentin Tarantino. These movies pinned down a regional genre that Ritchie’s former collaborator Matthew Vaughn later supercharged into something more stylized and ironized, especially in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22847361/the-kings-man-review">cartoonish, James Bond-baiting Kingsman series of spy flicks</a>.</p>
<p id="xiH5fK">Because Ritchie’s early movies loom so large, and because his legacy and Vaughn’s have been so muddled together, it’s natural to expect Ritchie’s World War II film <em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em> to play in similarly over-the-top fashion, like a mix of <em>Kingsman</em> and Tarantino’s <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>. The title and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvwDen1Wrx8">trailer</a> of the movie, which is now available on DVD, 4K UHD, and on demand, seem to suggest that, too.</p>

<p id="nQcdWP">But Ritchie isn’t that kind of director anymore, if he ever was. In the last few years, he’s reined in his stylistic flourishes, dialed down his budgets, and settled into a comfortable rhythm as a fast-moving genre workhorse, cranking out well-crafted, efficient, unvarnished films at a pace that should impress even Steven Soderbergh. <em>Ungentlemanly Warfare</em> is one of these: a brisk, no-nonsense wartime adventure as clipped as the posh accent of its star, Henry Cavill. It’s got more in common with the original 1967 version of <em>The Dirty Dozen </em>than with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inglourious-Basterds-Brad-Pitt/dp/B002UEW31I?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Inglourious-Basterds-Brad-Pitt/dp/B002UEW31I?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Tarantino’s postmodern take on it</a>.</p>
<p id="LsuBfm"><em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em>’s premise is that Winston Churchill himself (Rory Kinnear) commissions a deniable black ops mission to a neutral West African port, with the goal of destroying the supply lines feeding the Nazi U-boats that have a stranglehold on the Atlantic. This actually happened; it was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Postmaster">Operation Postmaster</a>, and Ritchie’s movie is based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TV1TCTS?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TV1TCTS?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Damien Lewis’ nonfiction book about it</a>. Many of the film’s characters, including Cavill’s Captain Gus March-Phillipps, are real people, but the story has been very heavily fictionalized.</p>
<p id="v3dUvF">In Ritchie’s version, March-Phillipps is an unruly loose cannon who just happens to have the perfect manners of the old Etonian he is. (The real March-Phillipps was supposedly one of Ian Fleming’s models for James Bond; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24026009/slow-horses-season-3-review-watch-it"><em>Slow Horses</em></a>’ Freddie Fox plays Fleming in the movie,  in his days as a naval intelligence officer.) March-Phillipps is tasked with putting together a commando team of similarly reckless ne’er-do-wells to carry out Churchill’s plan. He assembles a group whose chiseled good looks and extreme muscle definition are only matched by their impeccable sang-froid. </p>

<p id="Lx1P43">In truth, they’re a more forgettable bunch than is ideal for a movie like this, with the exception of ginormous actor Alan Ritchson (<em>Reacher</em>) as Anders Lassen — though he’s memorable for both good and bad reasons. Ritchson’s brutal fight scenes are among the movie’s biggest pleasures, but the film’s biggest shock comes when you realize he’ll be doing that terrible Danish accent for the whole story.</p>
<p id="ZI6fkJ">There isn’t much more to relate about this extremely simple film. There’s a sadistic Nazi bad guy played by Til Schweiger. There are a couple of intrepid spies (Eiza González and Babs Olusanmokun) who almost have more to do than the commandos themselves, and definitely have more charisma. Kinnear underplays Churchill, and unfortunately, so does his makeup. Ritchie includes one of those rather sad scenes that attempts to set up a movie franchise you just know will never come to pass.</p>
<p id="FvKRzE">The dialogue (by Ritchie and three other screenwriters) is lumpy and unconvincing, but that’s not why anyone watches a film like this. It’s a romp, disposable but sturdily made, with satisfyingly blunt action scenes that have been framed by a true master. Lots of things blow up, Ritchson murders many a Nazi, and Cavill sticks his tongue out while firing a machine gun. (Remember when he fired one one-handed while leaning out of a helicopter in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/13/17566174/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise"><em>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</em></a>? Has anyone other than Arnie looked better handling a machine gun on screen? I don’t think so.)</p>

<p id="A6uoai"><em>Ungentlemanly Warfare </em>is a serviceable action movie, and its plainness is, paradoxically, the most interesting thing about it. At one point, Cavill persuades a local African warlord (Danny Sapani) to join his mission, essentially by pointing out that they both went to Eton. Their connection is laden with social, racial, and colonial baggage, but Ritchie makes nothing more of it than a celebration of this ancient brotherhood of privileged bullies. Old Etonians know when something’s just not cricket, and they’ll bloody well roll their sleeves up and slaughter whoever gets in their way if they need to, won’t they, old chap?</p>
<p id="6B8YNb">Forgive me; as a Brit who’s spent the last 14 years living under the casually cruel rule of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">exactly</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">this</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak">breed</a> of entitled, stiff-upper-lip, overgrown schoolboy, I can do without it. <em>Ungentlemanly Warfare</em> modernizes and diversifies the archetype’s self-glorifying narrative a bit, but without really examining it. Ritchie seems happy to have found a straightforward, harmonized historical origin point for his manly ideal of well-bred thugs — and never mind all that problematic stuff about Empire.</p>
<p id="SC9aw2">He can do better. I prefer his current Netflix series <em>The Gentlemen</em>, adapted from his 2019 film, about a young duke who discovers that his inherited estate comes with a profitable marijuana farm attached. That series is just as obsessed with the collision of class and violence; in the first episode, “Refined Aggression,” Giancarlo Esposito delivers a speech — almost a manifesto — that perfectly distills the Ritchie aesthetic. (“People either survive in the jungle or exist in the zoo; few recognize the significance of the paradoxical reconciliation of the two.”) Netflix’s <em>The Gentlemen </em>is mostly played for broad comedy and thrills. But in its modern setting, it finds some interesting, inverted power dynamics among its cast of toffs, gangsters, and ruthless moneymen — and it’s almost satirical in the way it portrays them.</p>
<p id="smMlqs">Guy Ritchie knows his patch. In <em>The Gentlemen</em>, he rakes it over thoroughly, turning up new material. In <em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em>, he retreats into its comforting lies to spin another yarn about chaps who are a bit naughty, and jolly good at killing. Both of these projects are entertaining enough while they last, but only one of them bears thinking about afterward. </p>

But aside from the very pretty Gravesite Plains, and one of those annoying chakram ninja things, the very first thing you’ll notice when you step into the Realm of Shadow is a massive, walking Wicker Man on fire, and a village that’s been reduced to ash. Kinda makes you wonder if those two things are related.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194651" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: April 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="208" data-playlist="194651,195502,196923" data-current="194651"><div><p>The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: April 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194651/194651_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194651/194651_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194651/194651_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194651/194651_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Either way, like most things you meet in <em>Elden Ring</em>, if it’s moving, it definitely needs to die, but just walking up and trying to stick a sword in these guys is an easy way to end up extra crispy inside your own armor. Just ask any of the poor bastards whose charred corpses are actually sticking out of these things as they walk around. There’s a bunch of these guys roaming the land, too, some of which are very much blocking your way to the critical path, so knowing how to deal with them is an especially vital skill. As a famous bear once said, only you can prevent forest fires, so here’s everything you need to know about how to make that bear proud.<br></p><h2 id="h77439"><a id=""></a><strong>Furnace Golem abilities</strong></h2><div><p>The problems with these guys start when you’re within a football field away from ‘em, as they can kick up a ton of flaming dirt that can be a one-hit kill early on in the DLC. The ones that don’t kick up a firestorm basically spew it from the basket on top of their heads, which is worse, since those flames will actually follow you a bit. At the very least, by the time you get to those guys, you should have a few Scadutree Fragments, and there’s a chance you might actually survive the barrage. There’s only a couple that do this–most notably, the Golem across the broken bridge over at the Ancient Ruins of Rauh–but there’s also a rare attack where the Golem will go full Godzilla, and breatheheat attack at you that can travel a preposterous distance across the map. </p><p>Things actually get a little simpler once you’re up close and personal with these things, where all they do is try to stomp on you. The issue there is each stomp creates a wave of fire across the ground. If they leap and stomp, it creates an explosion you can’t jump. They can also kneel down and try to grab you. If they catch you, they’ll throw you in their head basket and that’s an instant kill. If you’re in an elevated position, they’ll try to punch you instead. </p></div><h2 id="h77440"><a id=""></a>Some tips for beating Furnace Golems</h2><p>These guys will often be in wide open areas, virtually by themselves, and if they aren’t they usually trample over or burn any other enemies in the vicinity for you. That’s especially helpful for the Golem at the front door of the Shadow Keep, since there’s an entire encampment of soldiers hanging out at his feet who get absolutely bulldozed when he makes his way downhill. In the open areas, take advantage of the espace.</p><p>The other good news is, yes, you can summon Spirit Ashes once you’re within a certain range of a Golem’s stomping grounds. Unfortunately, for the most part, Spirit Ashes are more bait than anything else. They’re gonna have even more trouble getting close to these things than you do, but having them there to pull aggro will buy you a couple of minutes.</p><p>As you might’ve guessed, for the ones out in fields, your very first move will be to make your approach on Torrent, circling towards the Golem, and boosting speed when you see his leg rearing back to kick some dirt, or when his head starts erupting. Once you’re close enough, you’re gonna want to stay on Torrent for the extra mobility, and keep behind the Golem as much as possible. If you’re not already, get real good with cornering. Turning on a dime is gonna be crucial. The double jump is the real game-changer, though, since that mostly makes the fight a lethal game of double dutch. The leaping stomp can be a minor problem since you can’t leap over the explosion that it makes at close proximity, but it’s extremely well telegraphed, and being on Torrent means you can boost yourself out of the blast radius in a hurry.</p><p>Now, ultimately, the real target on these guys is the bearded face at the front of his basket. As you might’ve noticed, it’s a little high up. If you’re trying to make things harder for yourself, you can try firing projectiles directly at the face while on horseback, but the real move here for most of these guys is to target the Golem’s legs. At first, it’ll seem like you’re only doing chip damage to this thing, since the life bar on the legs doesn’t budge much, but, we assure you: keep at it. You’re not trying to dismember this guy, you’re trying to build up enough stagger to get the Golem to drop to one knee.<br></p><p>To that end, we recommend trying to work on one leg at a time, but, if you’ve got a shot at a clear hit, take it. We recommend your strongest and/or longest sword for this, but timing is everything, and some of the best swords for crippling the Golem’s stance are also the ones that lock you into a swing animation, right when the Golem’s about to stomp. Plan accordingly before committing to any strike.<br></p><p>What you ultimately want, however, is to get one leg to stagger, then start working the other. If the Golem gets back up, breaking the same leg won’t have the direct effect you’re looking for which is that, when both legs have been staggered, the Golem will full-on faceplant into the dirt.  Once it’s down, ride up to its face and give it a riposte, which will knock off around half its health. Don’t worry if you have to ride around it a bit to find where the face landed, the stagger time on this guy is pretty generous. Worst case scenario is if you’re fighting on uneven terrain, and the riposte can’t trigger. In those cases, don’t waste the opportunity, hit the face with your bigger attack, as you can still do some serious damage while he’s grounded. If you’re ambitious, and you’ve been using the Starscourge Greatsword (it does the most stagger damage, but the swings are slow), landing both hits of Starcaller Cry can wipe out almost half its health.</p><h2 id="h77441"><a id=""></a>The Furnace Pot solution</h2><p>“Oh crap,” you say, “this Furnace Golem has armor on its legs! Now what?!” That, friends, is your cue to take the high road. The armored Golems are always close to a rise of land that puts you above their heads. It’s never an easy trip, since those Golems typically spam the eruption attacks more than anything, but once you make it to the top, what you’re actually looking to do is toss Fire or Furnace Pots into the Golem’s head basket, while dodging the flame attacks and the Golem’s big swinging punches. Why does fire do the most damage to a thing that’s already on fire? One of life’s little mysteries, I suppose.<br></p><p>Your reward for all your hard work is always a brand-new Crystal Tear–some of which are absolutely game-breaking with the right builds–and a Furnace Visage which, once you have the recipe, can help you craft another Furnace Pot to take down the next Golem.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
