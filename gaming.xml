            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - Prismatic Evolutions represents the culmination of the slow build-up to Pokémania 2025. The wild popularity of the set sold preorders out fast, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-where-to-buy-in-stock">stock only now starting to return to shelves and online retailers</a>. But, despite these difficulties, it's quickly become the ultimate crown jewel of the Scarlet and Violet era, delivering fan-favorite Eevee and its evolutions in jaw-dropping Special Illustration Rares and ultra-rare Master Ball foils. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Packed with over 200 cards, including powerhouse Pokémon like Roaring Moon ex and Pikachu ex, this set blends stunning artwork with competitive playability, making it a must-have for trainers and collectors alike. Improved pull rates for Special Illustration Rares sweeten the deal, giving fans a better shot at pulling their dream cards, even as demand hits an all-time high.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/pokmon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-preorders-live-at-best-buy-2-1730736946734.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokemon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions - Elite Trainer Box - Credit: The Pokemon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, the new sets aren't just about beautiful cards—they're introducing exciting mechanics like Budew's game-changing free attack, and doubling down on rarity tiers to thrill pack-openers. Fancy hunting for the Eeveelution family or stacking your deck with tournament-ready hits? Prismatic Evolutions offers something for everyone. It's not just another expansion; it's the kind of release that defines a generation of Pokémon TCG fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, in my experience the pulls have been rough in Prismatic Evolutions so far. This won't be the same for everyone, of course. Moreover, on the one hand, it is a good thing; your SIRs and the rest have a much better chance of holding their value. On the other hand, 25 booster packs didn't bring the goods. Let's take a look at some of the exciting new cards that I did manage to bag, and then discuss some of the other exciting (and rare) new additions the expansion brings to see is Prismatic Evolutions is truly worth the hype.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Glaceon ex (Suprise Box Promo Stamp) 026/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-9-1737718353557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Glaceon ex could end up being a sound playable card by building up enough damage on an opponent's bench to knock it out before it comes into play. The challenge with Tera ex-cards is using multiple energies. However, seeing a Glaceon Tera ex deck in action would be very entertaining.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Eevee Elite Trainer Box Promo 173</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-10-1737718374095.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its stunning full artwork, this one will likely be in trainers' binders rather than their decks. It's still the standard Eevee card in this set, allowing trainers to evolve it as soon as it's played. It certainly makes playing an Eeveelution deck a lot easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mela Trainer SAR 140/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-11-1737718394762.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mela is a powerful trainer card that can be used at the right time. Trainers can grab a fire energy from their discard pile whilst topping up their hand with 6 cards, which would come in handy mid to late game. Again, this is one for a trainer binder, with the usual Mela trainer card being fairly easy to pull.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pikachu ex 028/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-12-1737718521837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions also addresses Surging Sparks FOMO with Pikachu ex, although it's not a Tera ex. Thanks to Thunder, it's a relatively straightforward basic ex, with the possibility of one-hit knockouts in three turns. It's a high energy cost, but it's a lovely card to build up from the bench to switch in and out, thanks to its one energy retreat cost.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Max Rod Ace Spec 116/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-13-1737718545967.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card can literally flip a battle on its head. Imagine having Tyranitar's ex knocked out alongside its four energy cards, then using this Max Rod to get it all back and start building it again from the bench. Probably one of the most useful Ace Specs cards we've seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Espeon ex 034/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-14-1737718572842.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Espeon ex decks are going to be very hard to combat thanks to their ability to both discard from an opponent's hand and de-evolve all opposing Pokémon, shuffling the evolution cards into their deck. This one card can drag a battle out and whittle down opponents, so imagine a deck built around four of them. Insane.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tyranitar ex 064/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-15-1737718597512.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Grind makes Tyranitar ex very playable. But it's a different story when I consider it a second-stage evolution with a minimum of three energy cards attached to stretch its legs. I love Tyranitar, but this ex-card ain't it, chief. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Prismatic Evolution Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a given that we all want the Eeveelution SIR cards from Prismatic Evolutions. Still, some seriously cool overlooked artwork in this expansion might be worth snapping up if you see a bargain.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-16-1737719041103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131 is one of my favorite artworks from this set, and I'm very tempted to build a deck around Phantom Dive. Two energy costscosts for a combined 260 damage, 60 of which can be spread on your opponent'sopponent's bench. It's an insane move; watch for this card creeping up in value just because trainers want it in their deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roaring Moon ex SIR 162/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-17-1737719796337.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another heavy hitter with Roaring Moon ex-SIR with stunning artwork. A triple hit energy spend for its attacks is brutal, but this basic Pokémon card could be the final push in a tight battle. Loading a deck up with Stadium cards and building support around Roaring Moon ex sounds like a fun deck to build, that's for sure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Umbreon ex SIR 161/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-18-1737720000986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, ​I doubt anyone will use an $1200+ Umbreon ex SIR in their decks, but if you take a look at that mental moveset, you'd surely be tempted. Like Roaring Moon ex, this card has the chance of flipping a Pokémon TCG battle on its head in the 11th hour with both of its moves. Yes, it needs three different energy types. Still, there's some fun to be had building out an Eeveelution deck around Umbreon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with all things considered, is Prismatic Evolutions worth the hype? In short yes. There are plenty of awesome cards to add to your binder and more playable cards. Still, you'll be waiting for stock to appear without brilliant timing. Eeveelution-based sets will always be cool, but the chances of pulling one of the elusive Eeveelution SIRs is 1 in 900 booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the addition of God packs and Master Ball cards, which is very cool. Imagine pulling every SIR in one booster pack? The problem is it's very unlikely to happen, so strap in and get ripping packs and boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stock has been hard to come by for Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions, and things are only now starting to even out a little. Pokémon is at the height of popularity again, between TCG Pocket, investors buying up stock, and general increased demand for sets such as Surging Sparks, it's a crazy time to get into the hobby. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">The Pokémon Company's efforts to restock shelves ASAP</a>, Prismatic Evolutions also represent a turning point of going online or in-store to buy stock instead of resorting to the questionable secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions collection offers a range of products for collectors and players, each celebrating the beloved Eeveelutions. At the top, the Elite Trainer Box provides nine booster packs, an exclusive full-art Eevee promo, and useful extras like sleeves, dice, and condition markers—ideal for anyone building their collection or deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a simpler option, the Surprise Box includes a few booster packs and a random Eeveelution ex promo with a Prismatic Evolutions stamp, offering an affordable way to dip into the set. Similarly, the Mini Tin is a compact choice with two booster packs, a collectible Eevee coin, and an art card, doubling as a neat storage solution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors will appreciate the Binder Collection, which pairs four booster packs with a sturdy Eevee-themed binder for organizing prized cards like Master Ball foils or Special Illustration Rares. The Tech Sticker Collection adds a playful touch with Eevee stickers and two booster packs, perfect for younger fans or casual fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, the Poster Collection combines display-worthy content with collectibility, featuring three booster packs, a fold-out Eevee poster, and exclusive holo promos of Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Each product highlights the magic of the Prismatic Evolutions set, offering something for every kind of Pokémon fan, whether you're chasing rare cards, organizing your collection, or simply enjoying the Eevee hype.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod is now available for download, introducing ultrawide support to the newly released PC version of the game.</p>
<p>The current work-in-progress version of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Fix mod, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FF7RebirthFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, aims to improve the PC version of the game over time by introducing a variety of improvements. As of now, the mod only introduces ultrawide support by supporting any aspect rations with corrected FOV and centered 16:9 HUD. As the mod is still in a very early version, issues are expected.</p>
<p>Among some of the essential settings that the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth lacks is in-game FOV settings. Thankfully, user dammy63 from the FearLess Cheat Engine forums came to the rescue with a <a href="https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?p=389117#p389117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Engine table</a> that allows users to change the game's FOV value. As the modding tools evolve, a proper mod should also be released for those who do not want to use Cheat Engine for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <p>My favourite genre of YouTuber is: "person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69u_Pxb_8zI">where the rivers in Skyrim go</a>, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>. This is vital work. This is important work.</p>

<p>This act of, uh, "research" has been performed by YouTuber Allie Meowy, who spends an hour taking the viewer step-by-step through the various bathroom belt unbucklings and musing on each urination with a critical lens that absolutely nobody deemed necessary. That's great. I won't spoil exactly how many pees you can pee in the choice-heavy crime thriller. You'll have to watch the video (or skip through it) to find out. I will say it's not a huge or impressive number. It is a very plain amount of pees for a story that follows four people over four days. But it's not the number of pees that's important, it's the stains we found along the way. </p>
<p>"We will build on our knowledge of the piss mechanics throughout this video," says Alllie, with an alarming amount of straight-faced  professionalism. "In most games you shoot people and it means nothing. In Heavy Rain, you piss and the narrative is very slightly enhanced. And you know what? I think that's beautiful."</p><p>As anyone who has ever yelled "Jason" in a shopping mall can attest, Heavy Rain is a magnet for irony. It is impossible to enjoy this (or arguably any game by Quantic Dream) without cackling out loud at certain moments. For all their desire to be grand, meaningful works of art, these games are laden with nonsense, both intentional and unintentional. </p>
<p>Yet the video is not just a litany of gags at the expense of 2010's best and worst choose-your-own-misery game. As the piss countdown progresses, Allie's intense scrutiny results in some weirdly interesting observations. For example, Madison, the only playable woman in the story, flushes the toilet automatically, whereas all male characters require the player to activate the flush themselves. In many instances, you will pee and be unable to wash your hands. You will often eat or rub your face soon afterwards. </p>
<p>The piss is not dynamically tracked by the game, she also notes. You can drink carton after carton of orange juice and you will never become bursting to go. And some of the bathrooms in the game's US setting (not-quite-Philadelphia) lack a sink because that's how some bathrooms exist in real life France, where the game's designers were based. </p>
<p>"You can easily go the whole game without taking a piss even once," observes Allie. "I don't know why you'd want to do that but it technically is an option for players who prefer a pissless play style."</p>
<p>And just like that "pissless playstyle" has become one of my favourite phrases of the year so far. </p>
<p>The video also acts as a surprisingly thorough breakdown of the game's storyline. If you have never played Heavy Rain, and can't face doing a whole playthrough yourself, I can now recommend this as the definitive way to have the story summarised. Yes, the focus is on urine. Yes, the word piss occurs approximately 150 times in the course of the video. But I have probably learned more about this Cage game in the past hour than I did after two playthroughs when it first released. </p><p>Pee is on the brain here at RPS, it seems. I recently reviewed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>, a mechanic sim in which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">drink your own wizz</a> to reduce both your thirst bar and urine bar at the same time. Meanwhile, first-piss-on-shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urge">Urge</a> got Edwin's attention for being "the most interesting open world shooter in a long while, and also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/urge-is-the-most-interesting-open-world-shooter-in-a-long-while-and-also-the-most-revolting">the most revolting</a>". Anyway. That's all the piss we have for the moment, reader. Now, wash your hands.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Here's your feelgood story for the weekend, possibly: the creators of megahit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> are using some of their Palbucks to set up a new publishing arm, and their first project as publisher is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios, the struggling developers of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Intriguingly, this doesn't appear to be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tales-of-kenzera-devs-are-making-a-gothic-horror-rpg-beat-em-up-where-two-characters-fight-over-one-body">"Project Uso"</a> Surgent revealed last October, which founder Abubakar Salim described as both a reflection on the experience of fatherhood and "a cross between an RPG and a beat 'em up power fantasy". According to Salim, that game was set in the same world as the studio's debut Afrofuturist platformer. Their new game for Pocketpair isn't. Instead, it's being intriguingly positioned as a game "about" the entertainment industry.
</p>
<p>
"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks," Salim comments in statements shared with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/pocketpair-launches-publishing-arm-partners-with-surgent-studios-for-first-title">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it."
</p>
<p>
This doesn't mean there won't be another Kenzera game, mind. "We're still in an earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going," Salim added.
</p><p>
It's certainly a timely turn of events for Surgent. While pretty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">well-reviewed</a>, Tales Of Kenzera appears to have sold much worse than hoped. Surgent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-studio-founded-by-assassins-creed-origins-actor-lay-off-staff-less-than-three-months-after-debut-game">laid off around a dozen staff</a> in July last year, just three months after release, and subsequently put their whole games division on hiatus. 
</p>
<p>
It's also a timely turn of events for Pocketpair, who are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">being sued by Nintendo for patent infringement</a>. In case you've been living under a boulder since last winter, the studio's reputation-making poach-me-do has plenty in common with the Pokémon series, though Pocketpair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">appear secure, at least, against the separate charge of copyright theft</a>.</p>
<p>Salim's canned statements about Pocketpair "taking risks" ring true here, though I'm not sure they accurately describe the game's design. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> ain't too bad as monster-bagging base-builders go, but it won't be winning any awards for imagination.
</p>
<p>
All of which leaves me curious about the above "pattern in the entertainment industry" Surgent intend to target. Salim has been outspoken on the subject of racism in the games industry and community, so perhaps that'll be the focus. Or perhaps the Pal-published game will pit you against some rotund, mustachioed lawyers who are accompanied by cuddly electric pissmonsters that look absolutely nothing like Pikachu.

At least, that’s how its most recent patch notes read. <em>The Veilguard </em>just got its fifth big update, mostly consisting of bug fixes, and it sounds like BioWare is happy with the state of the game and will now be monitoring it for game-breaking bugs.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

But in the intro text, BioWare writes, “With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!” That last bit is the elvish phrase for “farewell,” which hasn’t been included in the sign-off for any of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s previous patch notes. That sounds final, and if the game isn’t getting any DLC, it’s not too surprising that BioWare would wrap up patches and move on to the next <em>Mass Effect</em>. While <em>The Veilguard </em>is divisive for both good- and incredibly bad-faith reasons, it’s probably the most polished game in BioWare’s portfolio, so I wouldn’t think it needed a ton of maintenance. We’ve reached out to BioWare for comment and will update the story if we hear back.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-bought-a-ps5-for-the-sole-purpose-of-playing-ffvii-rebirth-now-it%E2%80%99s-out-on-pc-and-i%E2%80%99m-full-of-regret.1091217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-ps5-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much of last year was a blur to me, but I absolutely remember what I was doing around this time in ye olde monthe of January 2024 (give or take a couple weeks): trudging through the cold carrying a freshly-purchased PlayStation 5 back to my apartment. I’d spent years relying exclusively on my PC to experience the current generation of games, but I <em>needed </em>to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> as soon as humanly possible. No exclusivity window would dissuade me. I would finally and ruefully eat the cost of a new console. Then I blinked, a year passed, and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> came to PC.</p><p>This is not to say that I never played my PS5 copy of <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>, to this day the only PS5 game I own. I <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-queens-blood-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became obsessed with Queen’s Blood</a> and made it all the way to chapter eight of the main story. I even managed to figure out how to <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream the game to my Steam Deck</a> using Chris Person tech magic. But as happens with a great many games, life intervened, and I fell off playing it before I could reach the (<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-aerith-black-materia-1851310221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently-controversial</a>) ending. One thing led to another – by which I mean 2024 led to 2025 – and now we’re here.</p><p>This is especially galling because of the trouble I went through to obtain my PS5. Originally I ordered one off Amazon, but when I received the notification that it had arrived, I couldn’t find it. Turns out, it had been stolen from my building’s mailroom – pilfered, apparently, at random alongside several other boxes, but I have to imagine that the thief felt like he’d hit the jackpot when he realized what he’d nabbed. I ended up going to my building’s super to pull security footage, but by that point the thief was long gone.&nbsp;</p><p>I learned only one thing of note from the footage: For whatever reason, the thief had chosen to wear a weirdly ostentatious jacket that day – not the precise jacket from <em>Drive </em>(2011), but one with a similar coloration and pattern. I spent weeks wondering why somebody would dress up in such identifiable clothing before going on a stealing spree. I swore that if I ever saw that jacket, guy in tow, walking around my neighborhood, I’d fire off some stern words like “Hey man, what gives” or “Please return my PS5; you’ve made me very sad.” Nothing ever came of it.</p><p>Finally, options exhausted, I decided to just buy a PS5 in-person at my local GameStop. If The Jacketed Man wanted to steal this one, he’d have to fight me for it. Fortunately, my second attempt at purchasing a PS5 proved uneventful. I took it home, plugged it in, and downloaded a pre-release review copy of <em>Rebirth</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, that’s right: I managed to get my hands on a copy of the game slightly before everybody else, and even then, I failed to finish it in a timely fashion. It’s embarrassing! All the more so because even though I can now play it on my platform of choice – with bleeding-edge graphics on my PC and wherever I want on my Steam Deck (not just in my home via Chris Person tech magic) – I’m not going to because I’m <em>just </em>far enough in the PS5 version that I have no desire to do it all over again.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, I am a weak-willed fool, a stain on my family’s legacy. That said, I think there’s a small silver lining to all of this: I played plenty of other games last year, large and (mostly) small. There’s such an abundance of great stuff coming out all the time that even games you’ve been anticipating for years can fall by the wayside. And so, in a sense, you don’t <em>need </em>those games – or rather, you are more capable of waiting for them than you might think. Exclusivity windows, like time, are an illusion, and both will pass before you know it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop"><h3>YouTube’s New AI Is Inspiring Content Creators To Make Their Videos Boring</h3></a><p>Once again asking, begging, perhaps even pleading the question "Who is this for"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-officially-reach-the-2m-mark.1091199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Knights Peak and developer Owlcat Games have announced that their CRPG&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new sales milestone over six years after its initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>sales have now hit the two million mark. It seems the milestone may have been reached a little too late for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-delays-its-rule-until-september-25th" rel="nofollow">sixth anniversary</a>, which fell in September last year, but it's still an achievement for Owlcat and Knights Peak to be proud of.</p>

<p>At last count, Owlcat's followup&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-sales-reach-1-million" rel="nofollow">reached a million sales</a>, and earlier this week, the studio revealed that its grimdark futuristic CRPG&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit the same number</a>. That puts&nbsp;<em>Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>out in front as the studio's best-selling game to date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m-dragon.jpg?itok=cJyjxrMi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m-dragon.jpg?itok=yIlmD9Dx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>has hit the two million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It does mean that the game is trailing behind genre rivals <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" rel="nofollow">like&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, but given that Owlcat's games are arguably much more niche than Larian's big hit, that's probably not a big surprise.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, it's a CRPG that serves as both Owlcat Games' first title and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-crpg-pathfinder-kingmaker-announced-chris-avellone-to-contribute" rel="nofollow">first video game</a> to be set in the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>world. The game sees you building and managing your very own kingdom, navigating courtly intrigue and seeing off threats to your rule as you do so.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a modern CRPG, the game lets you create your own hero and meet a range of diverse companions, as well as iconic figures from the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>mythology. It also allows you to choose between real-time and turn-based combat depending on your personal preference, which is always nice.</p>




<p><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA14853_00-KINGMAKER00000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pathfinder-kingmaker-definitive-edition/BPHQQN22GB7L" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can also play it on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility. Stay tuned for more on all other things Owlcat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"><em>Fantasian</em> on Apple Arcade in 2021</a> was meant to be an end to the illustrious career of Hironobu Sakaguchi — but it seems like he can’t stay away.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em> was a return to Sakaguchi’s roots, a throwback roleplaying game from the creator of the <em>Final Fantasy </em>series, which added some innovative gameplay ideas and an incredibly charming world made of handcrafted dioramas. And in December, his Mistwalker studio released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi">a new version dubbed <em>Neo Dimension</em></a>, which brought the game to more platforms and added new features like voice acting. It was even published by <em>Final Fantasy</em> company Square Enix. While Sakaguchi says he “intended <em>Fantasian</em> to be my final project before I retired,” he now wants to make another game in the same mold, one he hopes can be seen as “a successor to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>.” The sixth <em>Final Fantasy</em> game is particularly notable as the last to feature pixel art before the series shifted to 3D.</p><p>Following the launch of <em>Neo Dimension</em>, I had the chance to ask Sakaguchi a few questions about making <em>Fantasian</em>, the enduring popularity of turn-based RPGs, and what comes next.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and length. </em></p><p><strong>There have obviously been a lot of comparisons to <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and you were inspired in part to make this game because of <em>FFVI</em>. Do the comparisons bother you? Do you ever worry people are missing what makes <em>Fantasian</em> unique?</strong></p><p>Not really, since my approach to creating <em>Fantasian</em> was different from my previous works. For this project, I aimed to tap into my inner creativity to earnestly craft an RPG once more, so because of this, drawing comparisons with existing games felt pointless to me. I intended <em>Fantasian</em> to be my final project before I retired, so it was somewhat of a farewell note from me.</p><p>With the production and release of <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> — a definitive director’s cut version — I believe that the game has become complete. In the distant future, or maybe after I have already left this world, I imagine this game will find its meaning if someone chooses to look into the legacy of either myself or <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p><p><strong>What was it like working with Square Enix again? That feels like an interesting full-circle moment.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s the place where I started my career, so coming full circle through the game I envisioned to be my final work was definitely a fascinating experience. There are times in life when we encounter coincidental full-circle moments or experience deja vu, but this particular instance felt very significant and comforting.</p><p><strong>The big change for this game is the addition of voice acting. What do you think that adds to the experience, and what was it like finding the right casting for these existing characters? Did you already have an idea in your head of how they would sound?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Since I wasn’t well versed with voice acting in games, I trusted Square Enix’s expertise and the artistic vision of director Takuto Nakamura. As a result, the voice actors — some of whom, for the Japanese version, were cast in consideration of&nbsp;their connection to <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> — were all wonderful. Establishing how the characters would sound involved extensive collaboration as well as trial and error with the voice actors, which I believe is a testament to the numerous ideas and inspirations contributed by all the staff who took part in the voice recording&nbsp;process.</p><div><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VI.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Square Enix</cite></p></div><p><strong>Both <em>Neo Dimension</em> and </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review"><strong>the <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake</strong></a><strong> came out around the same time to very positive reception. What do you think it is about this style of RPG that makes them still relevant today?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Games that employ cutting-edge technology are very appealing. Improved graphics are a given, but I’m anticipating that future games will likely also incorporate AI in innovative ways, and I’m personally very intrigued by these games. However, apart from these advancements, I also believe there is an intrinsic desire associated with gaming experiences to immerse oneself in virtual worlds.</p><p>With games that have a similar style to <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>, players can explore the virtual world and gain a sense of fulfillment that they have mastered everything that occurs within it. I think another factor is how these games allow developers to utilize energy created from this extraordinary technology to come up with unique mechanics that enable players’ total immersion in virtual worlds. It goes without saying that realizing both is feasible, and I do think that would represent the best kind of game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"><strong>I spoke to you ahead of the Apple Arcade launch</strong></a><strong>, you said you only wanted to work on games that brought you “genuine joy.” Now that you’ve wrapped up <em>Fantasian</em>, what does that joy look like for you moving forward? Do you think you want to stick to familiar styles and genres like this or explore new&nbsp;things?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was thinking of making <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> my final work, but the fantastic team that was assembled to complete this project was so enjoyable to work with that I found it hard to part ways. Humans are greedy creatures, aren’t we? For that reason, I’m currently working on a new project with the same team that&nbsp;worked on <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>. It’s generally going to follow a similar style to my previous works, and it’ll be something that can be a successor to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> in a good way — our goal is to create something old but new at the same time. It’ll be part two of my farewell note.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Palworld’s update version v0.4.14 is live now, bringing new Spring Festivals skins, specific adjustments, balancing changes and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld has introduced 5 new Spring Festival Skins in this update, each featuring unique elements reminiscent of the Chinese New Year. However, players should have the corresponding Pals to equip the skins. The new collection includes Lucky Cattiva, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen Noct, Lion-Dancer Chillet and Lion-Dancer Chillet Ignis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the new skins, Palworld has introduced some specific adjustments that change Pals’ behaviours and add new elements to some world regions. After the latest adjustments, Pals will attack the nearest enemy after being summoned. The behaviour of large pals at bases has been made the same as that of small pals to allow them to pass through narrow areas. Lastly, earth and water elements were added in various places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding balancing, Palworld has adjusted rewards, expanded the range of area near the reticle, and made some enhancements to crude oil production, along with other changes. In terms of bug fixes, a game-crashing bug was fixed. Also, some issues with UIs, treasure chests, PS5s and more have been resolved. Interested players can check out the <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1882627804296261984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> for Palworld’s update version v0.4.14 to learn more about balancing and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palworld revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-reveals-new-roadmap-for-one-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new roadmap for their first anniversary</a>.

                <p>The newest patch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out now, and some believe it could be the game's final update.

It also addresses a "blocking" issue with a puzzle in the Converged City, as well as a particularly horrible-sounding bug that caused Rook to get caught in a drowning loop when allies should be rescuing them. There is one quality-of-life change in the update as well, and this adds recommended levels to side quests.</p><p>BioWare has signaled that this may be the final significant update for The Veilguard, saying it is happy with the game's stability levels now and is shifting its focus to look for game-breaking bugs if they should appear. BioWare concluded its note by saying "Dareth shiral!" This <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_language" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">translates to</a> "farewell," and many are taking this to mean BioWare is moving on from The Veilguard.</p><p>This wouldn't be a surprise, of course, as BioWare itself confirmed in November 2024 that The Veilguard would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">receive no expansions and developers would shift to other projects</a>, including the next Mass Effect. GameSpot has contacted EA/BioWare in an attempt to get more details on what's next.</p><p>In other news, BioWare owner Electronic Arts recently announced that The Veilguard failed to reach the company's expectations for number of players. The game "engaged" 1.5 million players during the company's latest quarter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">down nearly 50% from the company's expectations.</a></p><h2><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard January 23 patch notes</strong></h2><p><b>Quality of Life Changes:</b></p><ul><li>Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels.</li></ul><p><b>Bug Fixes: </b></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Rook could only flirt with Lucanis in a specific conversation.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the Regrets of The Dread Wolf quest not triggering properly or stopping Rook with an invisible wall in the Crossroads.</li><li>Fixed a blocking issue with a puzzle in the Converged City area of the Crossroads.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the “Imperium’s Resolve” armor causing negative damage instead of the intended zero fire, cold, necrotic, and electric damage.</li><li>Fixed excessive clipping on Taash’s “Rivain’s Legacy” armor.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented some Rooks from changing the runes on their lyrium dagger.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the Medium Armor Mastery skill for Warriors.</li><li>Fixed a spot on Rivain’s beach where Rook could get stuck in a cycle of drowning, never to be pulled out of the water by their companions.</li><li>Fixed a typo on a note Rook can find in Dock Town.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused photo mode screenshots to be noticeably worse quality when HDR was turned to “On.”</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the photo mode screenshot location to still be shown on screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the fireflies in the opening area of the Crossroads to flicker at an alarming rate on specific settings.</li><li>Fixed a lighting issue in one of the conversations with the whole team in the Lighthouse.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the Mirror of Transformation that blocked players from zooming in and out with the mouse scroll wheel.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Objective Marker Visibility was not updated when the exploration preset was changed with the other options in the Exploration sub-category.</li><li>Some adjustments to the game credits.</li></ul>

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">January 2025 Xbox Developer Direct</a>, and its various games coming soon to Xbox... as well as PC, and nearly all on PlayStation 5 too.
</p>
<p>Microsoft's show featured the multiplatform Doom: The Dark Ages, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> 4, the shadow-dropped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-2">Ninja Gaiden 2</a>: Black and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, all of which proved the company's new mantra that everything is an Xbox. Only Compulsion Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> will be an Xbox console exclusive (at least for now).</p>
<p>But does any of that matter, really - especially as on Xbox you can get all those games on Xbox Game Pass? And what were our thoughts about what was shown? Joining me this week are Ed Nightinale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss Microsoft's latest showing that promises a strong start from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> to the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new patch for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and judging by the wording in the official patch notes, this looks to be the game's final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>website, EA says it was "so happy with the game's stability at launch" and that the game is now "in a stable place". As such, the development team is now "moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs", which rather sounds like there won't be any more significant content updates.</p>

<p>This patch isn't exactly massive, either; it doesn't add any new quests or content, but brings more quality-of-life changes, like recommended levels being added for lower-level quests and a number of bug fixes as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5-emmrich.jpg?itok=oKL7F_el 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5-emmrich.jpg?itok=x98jW0H- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>doesn't look to be getting any more big updates after its latest patch.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm speculating a little here, but it also sounds a bit like&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any major expansions like previous&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games did, so if you're expecting&nbsp;this game's version of <i>Awakening&nbsp;</i>or even DLC packs like&nbsp;<em>Trespasser</em>, you might want to save your disappointment now.</p>

<p>While the wording of the post seems to suggest EA and BioWare want to put a positive spin on ending updates for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, the fact remains that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">sold disappointingly</a> for the company, coming in at around half of EA's expectations for the quarter in which it released.</p>

<p>Along with&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s underperformance caused EA to adjust its financial expectations for the 2024-25 fiscal year, which in turn led to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/ea-shares-plunge-19percent-on-track-for-worst-day-since-dot-com-bubble.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">drop</a> in the company's stock value of almost 20%. Yeowch.</p>




<p>It's also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departed BioWare recently</a>, and while her departure isn't necessarily related to the game's underperformance, the timing of the two announcements seems a touch too coincidental for them not to be connected.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/bsdx4fnnc0dk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Patch 5 is out now.

<p>The director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has revealed that the game was delayed a second time due to ‘polishing’ and ‘complex roofs.’</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on March 20, 2025, and now we know why the game was delayed a second time. During a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Charles Benoit, AC Shadows’ Game Director, revealed that the month-long delay was “mostly about polishing,” “a couple of things in progression” to make the game more engaging and balanced, and Japan’s “super complex” roofs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game director explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ roofs and other Japanese architecture might be the “most complex thing” he has worked on compared to AC Odyssey and Syndicate. The developers had to work on “specific codes and specific animations” to make the parkour transition for these areas more fluid. The roofs and parkour around Japanese Architecture were feedback they wanted to address, and they believe that they have “improved since the last few months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was initially scheduled to be released in November 2024, but two delays pushed the release to February 2025 and the second to March 2025. Players hope this month-long extension will end up being the final obstacle in the game’s release. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-sniper-elite-games-in-release-order-release-dates/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve crafted a comprehensive list of every Sniper Elite game, their release dates, and a little bit about why they’re so significant. The series isn’t lauded like other third-person shooter contemporaries, but it deserves acclaim. 2025 brings the latest sequel, so let’s give Sniper Elite its dues after 20 years of World War warfare.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite’s niche combat mechanics and sometimes punishing difficulty make it unique. This is a good thing in a market saturated and overpopulated with hero shooters (look what happened to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>) and FPS gameplay. Missions usually take around an hour or so, with your mileage varying based on how thorough you are and how often you give away your position—causing half of Germany to rain down its wrath on you.</p>



<p>The scenery has changed from time to time, as has reality and the aliveness of the inhabitants. But Sniper Elite constantly retains its identity, and it’s been a hell of a journey so far, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> being the latest target in our sights.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-sniper-elite-games-are-there">How Many Sniper Elite Games Are There?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 10 mainline Sniper Elite games with two mini-Zombie Army expansions.</strong></p>



<p>The franchise has ebbed and flowed throughout history from the first <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. We’ve had VR and Zombie games, explored tropical climates, and even more Zombies games. Nazi Zombie Army and Nazi Zombie Army 2 are not considered full releases and joined Zombie Army Trilogy anyway.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-sniper-elite-game-in-order">Every Sniper Elite Game In Order</h2>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-released-on-sept-30-2005">Sniper Elite — Released on Sept. 30, 2005</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The beginning of something beautiful. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>It all started with 2005’s Sniper Elite. Rebellion tried something new, and it was a different take on other war shooters like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Medal of Honor. It’s very primitive compared to its successors and a product of its time, but we’ll always be thankful it was made.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-v2-released-on-may-2-2012">Sniper Elite V2 — Released on May 2, 2012</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re back again. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sniper Elite sequels became more frequent as time went on, but it wasn’t always the case. Rebellion was dipping its toes in several properties, so it took <strong>seven years before Sniper Elite V2 saw the light of day</strong>. The title’s clever wordplay aside, the now-famous X-Ray bullet feature played a prominent role in the sequel’s gameplay and marketing, and the series was starting to hot up.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-3-released-on-june-27-2014">Sniper Elite 3 — Released on June 27, 2014</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Boy, sure is a hot one today. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sniper Elite 3 only needed two years, not seven. However, we get a big change of location here as we venture into North Africa’s sizzling scorch. The third game proved to be <strong>my entry point</strong>, and its inconsistent AI and focus on gameplay rather than character development and story are complaints I still have with sequels to this day. However, Sniper Elite had a market, and as a result, more games were commissioned.</p>



<h3 id="h-zombie-army-trilogy-released-on-mar-6-2015">Zombie Army Trilogy — Released on Mar. 6, 2015</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No words. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zombie Army Trilogy arrived a few months later to revamp the formula. I reviewed this elsewhere in my early writing days, and it was an effort to capitalize on the growing Zombie game trend. It packaged all three Zombie Army games in a more linear and narrow-sighted effort. Repetition does creep in as you progress, but it was a welcome change to the Sniper Elite name.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-4-released-on-feb-14-2017">Sniper Elite 4 — Released on Feb. 14, 2017</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Numbers are racking up now. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Zombies are asleep for now as Sniper Elite 4 brings back the classic sandbox-based gameplay from the dead. The fourth mainline entry is the best-received release to this point from a critical standpoint, with reviewers enjoying the improved AI and enhancement of X-Ray kills. It sold well, meaning Sniper Elite 5 was an absolute given to be the next game.</p>



<h3 id="h-zombie-army-4-dead-war-released-on-feb-4-2020">Zombie Army 4: Dead War — Released on Feb. 4, 2020</h3>

<p>Had you for a moment, didn’t I? Zombie Army 4: Dead War comes next and adds many new ideas compared to Trilogy. New enemy types look to mutilate you (see the image above) and you gain ways to combat demons. We’ll see if <strong>Rebellion ever does another Zombie spin-off</strong>, and if not, Zombie Army 4 is a fine auf Wiedersehen. </p>

<p>It’s time for another Sniper Elite first with VR! Rebellion understands trends, and 2021 had the PSVR headset in full flow with competing headsets. When it comes to VR, how do you make the thrill of looking down the lens of a Sniper Rifle more immersive? The short and sweet affair wouldn’t be the last in the virtual space.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-5-kraken-awakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite 5</a> represents the series’ next-gen bow. The graphics are noticeably sharper (as is Karl’s aim) and the content hits harder in all the right places. Yes, I sound like a broken record, but the gameplay feels consistent and fun. I had a great time, but it feels like some key improvements are needed to elevate the franchise. SE5 is a great starting point for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S era, and Rebellion has used the hardware well.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-vr-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winter Warrior</a> arrived two years later, featuring a limited release schedule on Meta Quest devices. It’s the first time a SE title has embraced snow. Like the Zombies spin-offs, we’ll have to see if Rebellion goes cold with future Sniper Elite VR titles.</p>

<figure><figcaption>And here we are. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>And now we’ve come full circle to Sniper Elite Resistance. The sequel is a spin-off of sorts of the fifth main game, putting us in the shoes of Harry Hawker. Whatever happens, the Sniper Elite legacy is established at this point. Millions of copies have been sold, countless fans are vying for new releases, and as long as Rebellion is about, a Sniper Rifle won’t be too far away.</p>

<p>BioWare seems to be moving on from Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Just three months after its release in October, BioWare has released a new update for the game featuring a number of bug fixes. While that’s not out of the ordinary, it’s what the post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> says that suggests EA and BioWare are done with the game.</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard; we were so happy with the game’s stability&nbsp;at launch and hope you have enjoyed our Quality of Life patches since then,” the post reads. “With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!”</p>



<p>“Dareth shiral”, for those unaware, translates to “farewell” in the game’s language.</p>



<p>The idea that BioWare and EA are moving on from the game shouldn’t come as a surprise. Recently, EA confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missed its internal expectations</a> by nearly 50% with roughly 1.5 million players during the three months after the game’s release.</p>



<p>You can check out the full notes for the latest Dragon Age: The Veilguard update below.</p>
