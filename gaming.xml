            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam following its PC launch, with most of the complaints revolving around Sony’s controversial PlayStation Network Account requirement.</p><p>Sony had made it clear on the God of War Ragnarök Steam page that a PlayStation Network account would be required to play Sony Santa Monica’s purely single-player adventure, but that doesn’t seem to have prevented a number of negative reviews singling out the policy.</p><p>One negative Steam review, from a user who refunded the game after just 20 minutes of play, called out the PSN requirement. “Creating a PSN account was something I knew was necessary in advance and I was prepared to do so, until I was met with the reality of it,” they said. “For UK residents at least, it requires submitting a mobile phone number to verify your age just to start with, and if that fails (which it did, no texts were ever received) your only recourse is to submit a photograph of your face or a government-issued ID to a third party website. If you're happy with that, go right ahead.”</p><p>“Yeah I'm not linking my account to PSN especially for a single-player game,” reads another negative Steam user review, which also includes a list of Sony data breaches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries">Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem, which means God of War Ragnarök is unavailable on PC in over 100 countries.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Sony will change its mind again for God of War Ragnarök, which means the game may have to live with its ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating for some time. As for how popular God of War Ragnarök is on PC, Steam's official concurrent figures show 25,471 playing at the time of this article's publication. That's down significantly on the PC launch of God of War, which saw a peak of 73,529 players on Valve's platform.</p><p>God of War Ragnarök continues the stories of Kratos and his now teenage soon, Atreus. The sequel was praised as an enthralling spectacle on its release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">earning a 10 in IGN's review</a>.</p><p>"Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places," we wrote at the time. "God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Ellis said that "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended."</p><p>Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history. After years of costly development, the PvP first-person shooter launched August 23 priced $40 on PC and PlayStation 5, but its sales were estimated to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">around only 25,000</a> and its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">peak Steam concurrent player count was shockingly low</a> (Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers public). <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony then removed Concord from sale</a> just 11 days after launch, issuing refunds in the process.</p><p>According to Kotaku, staff at the 150-person Firewalk, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">Sony acquired in 2023</a> for an undisclosed fee, are anxiously awaiting their fate. While Ellis has indicated that Firewalk would “explore options” that suggest Concord may return in some form, some staff are said to be skeptical. Kotaku reports that some  have been asked to pitch ideas for new games, some are speculating they may be drafted in to help develop another Sony game, while others fear mass layoffs or even a studio shutdown.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Sony’s gaming business has already suffered significant cuts in 2024. In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>it announced a</u> <u>round of layoffs</u></a> affecting 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs impacted a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite, but PlayStation's London studio was hit hardest with a notice of closure.

			<p>New details for Slitterhead were revealed today, alongside new screenshots that provide a new look at some of the game's characters, skills and the Kowlong Slums stage.</p>
<p>In the game developed by <a href="https://bokehgamestudio.co.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bokeh Game Studio</a>, a new development studio founded by the creator of the Silent Hill and Siren series Keiichiro Toyama, players will get to encounter special characters like Julee and Alex, known as Rarities, who have a strong synchronization with protagonist Hyoki and grant access to a variety of skills, including Rarity Skills, whose effects are become active by just having them, and Active Skills which are activated by using the skill button and can be carried over even when possessing ordinary humans.</p>
<p>Besides showing more of the Rarities and skills, Bokeh Game Studio also shared a new look at one of the Slitterhead's stages, the Kowlong Slums. This gigantic slum is slated for demolition, and its residents are forced to leave. Many, however, refuse to do so, making it the perfect location for the horrors upon which the experience is focused.</p>

The score, composed by Wilbert Roget, II, is absolutely filled with pomp.

For example, I’ve always taken for granted how lowkey and tech-y the music in your starship is, which feels like the right call for an area that gradually gets upgraded and fleshed out as you advance through the ranks and unlock new stratagems, buffs, and weapons.

I’ve played <em>Helldivers 2 </em>quite a bit, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">covered it even more than that</a></span>, but I had never heard this thing until today, despite evidence suggesting players found it in-game a long time ago. Here’s just a sample of the batshit propaganda Super-Earth passes for an anthem:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Freedom must reign over every last star, through citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars / Honor their deaths, do your part for the cause</p><p>Steadfast support of our regime is how humankind will reign supreme / No questions or doubts shall be allowed, tractors will all be disavowed”</p></blockquote><p>Now imagine that being sung by a beaming choir. Or worse, picture kids singing that every morning before class, or at their graduation ceremonies. I’m no fan of the American national anthem, but at least we aren’t made to explicitly sing about “citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars.” I need a documentary about life in the Super-Earth colonies immediately, this is truly horrifying stuff. On the bright side, you can now air music like this from your car every Fourth of July if you so choose. Ain’t democracy grand?<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-ceo-on-why-the-callisto-protocol-struggled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Callisto Protocol struggled because it didn’t have a “gameplay edge”. That’s what Changhan “CH” Kim, CEO of the game’s publisher Krafton” said in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-says-the-callisto-protocol-suffered-because-it-lacked-a-gameplay-edge-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Kim talked about The Callisto Protocol being the first AAA single-player game from the studio and developer Striking Distance. He said that there was some “difficulty” within as to deciding whether the direction they were going in was the right way.</p>



<p>“This is a single-player narrative game [that’s] visually stunning and a high-quality game to look at,” he said. “Despite that, the game’s core is the gameplay. Gameplay comes first is what I learned with&nbsp;The Callisto Protocol. </p>



<p>“It could be the most high-quality game in the world, but if you don’t have a gameplay edge–if you can’t differentiate your gameplay from your competitors–it doesn’t work out. I was able to reaffirm that.”</p>



<p>He then told Game Developer that he understands that gameplay has to innovate with games in order for players to have interest. A new experience is what will help a game’s success.</p>



<p>“This allows for new experiences within the game, and even though [The Callisto Protocol] is a narrative game, a single-player game, you need to be able to offer a good gameplay experience,” Kim said. “You can’t do that without those elements.”</p>



<p>As far as moving forward, Kim says that the market is tough to guess what could work and what may not. Still, Krafton and the developers it works with will “continuously try these new creative ideas”.</p>



<p>“Not everything will succeed, but one of these days we might just hit another PUBG,” he said. “This is a very bottom-up approach, I would say, and it’s not what a lot of big companies are attempting right now.”</p>



<p>Do you agree with the reasoning behind the struggles of The Callisto Protocol when it launched in 2022? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/group-photo-the-editors-of-game-developer-discuss-their-favorite-game-photos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Photography Week, Game Developer has showcased new interviews, essays, and deep dives demonstrating the creative and technical process behind photography games and photo modes. In this group blog, join us as our editors ruminate on the photos and photo modes they love and explore their evolution and their value within the medium.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s so funny how it doesn’t matter if you’re a traditional photographer, or just like taking a lot of screenshots in video games—looking back at your early work is always so humbling. I recall taking these photos (including the header of this article) in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and being proud of them. So proud, in fact, that I hung on to them for years. It wasn’t actually that hard to find them, only one external storage device deep on my PC, 14 years and at least four hard drives later.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Western Sky mod for Fallout: New Vegas deeply altered the day and night cycle, rendering certain hours of the day pitch black, both a strategic and photographic opportunity.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember that taking photos in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was as much about enjoying the scenery as it was spending more time in the game. I didn’t actually like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at first; it wasn’t as dark as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and I wasn’t fond of how its cool greens and grays were replaced by the bright orange palette of the Mojave. A Nexus mod, Western Sky, actually changed my mind, adding dynamic lighting and weather effects that turned the environment hostile but also strangely beautiful, with pitch-black nights and intense blue skies and rad storms that would pummel the Courier into the sand.&nbsp;The mod not only had the effect of making the game more strategically interesting, but visually as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was the early Bethesda Fallout games that gave me the training wheels to move onto “real” photography; back then you’d use the console commands to quickly detach the camera and remove clipping, and with that, capture moments from the game at more dynamic angles. While not exactly as sophisticated of the photo modes today, or heck, even the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bethesda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> photo modes of today, it’s an experience I remember fondly for how much it did teach me about the basics. Take away the ability to consider fundamental things like depth of field and you’re left no option but to be in the moment and take in every detail within a tiny field of view that occupies that microscopic sliver of time. That it’s in a video game doesn’t make at any less an exercise in observation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That observation process can offer a lot of solitude and contemplation. It demands rumination and self-reflection even as it commands you be present to the exclusion of everything else. Maybe that’s why taking photos in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> felt so good. Documenting the journey of the Courier as they crossed so much desert on foot and encountered so much uncertainty and decay and emptiness became a mirror not just of their loneliness and isolation but also my own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These days I still take the occasional snap in Fallout. F</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>allout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a dedicated photo mode that combines traditional camera and photo editing features, letting you control depth of field, field of view, and lighting, and add player poses or picture frames. Unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s also easy to get more variety in your shots, as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is comprised of regional environments with dramatically different enemies, plants, weather and lighting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the improvements haven’t resulted in me taking more photos, despite how easy it would be to create my own scene with the game’s workshop tools. Maybe it’s just harder to find a moment of contemplation in a crowded live service game with so many random people looking over your shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, it’s nice to remember how mods and PC console commands paved the way. —Holly Green</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've recently fallen all the way down into a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-shaped Abyss. While I've been excited about the game ever since its launch last year, I never put much time into it until the last couple of weeks—and knowing photo week was coming up gave me the perfect excuse to dive in fully.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love the game—its compelling core loop of fishing, exploring, building your boat up to get better at all of the above (spiced with dodging unfathomable horrors), its slow burn Eldritch horror story and impeccable, salty vibes. It's also often a weirdly beautiful game despite its subject matter and increasingly horrific sea life. There's an aching loneliness to the player's journey that is constantly pierced by the ambient (not-mutated) critters splashing about: sea turtles shimmering in pairs, dolphins bounding playfully, whales surfacing briefly, subjecting you to a tiny little touch of majesty every now and then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It works in conjunction with the sky, the sea, the rough hewn little bits or architecture that people have eked out in this nightmare world. Your little boat, always a bit cartoonish and never a match for anything that lurks in the deep—but you keep going anyway. And every now and then, you get treated to a view like this one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It all seems to say sure, you're just a tiny speck in this terrifying, unknowable ocean. And on top of nature's indifference, there are creatures in the deep waiting to get at you, for harboring some of that forbidden knowledge humans should never have. But at least you aren't alone out there in infinity. Some beauty still remains. —Danielle Riendeau</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photography is a beautiful lie. Every photo you've ever seen isn't a snapshot of reality, it's light channeled through a lens, slapped onto a sensor or strip of film, and processed before becoming the image you see in the real world. That image is shaped by the aperture of the lens, the speed that the shutter clicks, and the "stock" of the medium the light lands on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love that lie. In-game photography tools make it so easy to easy play with, and it brings players close to the little lies that make games possible. When you freeze the world and muck around with artificial camera settings, you catch things developers don't want to be seen. But instead of killing the fantasy, it invites you to play with the lie yourself—especially when posing a character. I love juking the controls before smashing the "photo mode" button to move a character into the right pose, using an in-between frame to turn a simple transitional motion into a bit of storytelling that captures the "vibe" of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I call it a "lie," like it's a bad thing, but everyone knows a games are full of lies. Photo modes bring players in on the lie, and remind us these lies aren't meant to harm, but to help us speak in a language that goes beyond words. And I just think that's kind of neat. —Bryant Francis</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Community Editorial Coordinator, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Holly Green has been in games media for fifteen years, having previously worked as a reporter and critic at a variety of outlets.

            <p>It's a pirate's life for me, and it's a pirate's life for Goro Majima, recurring eyepatched anti-hero of the used-to-be-called-Yakuza series. He's the star of the just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, a game I can only applaud for the brazen straightforwardness of its title. Whatever Sega were drinking when they signed off on Metaphor: ReFantazio, they were not drinking when they signed off on this. They were definitely drinking <em>something</em>, though.

<p>Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii begins with Goro washing up on the beach of a strange island, much like Link in Link's Awakening, except that Goro has a full back tattoo and swanky leather trousers, and there is a small tiger wearing a neckerchief. [SCENE MISSING] Now Goro is wearing a tricorn hat and steering a galleon. There is mention of Madlantis. [SCENE MISSING] Now there are ninjas in bullet-proof vests, and Goro is throwing cutlasses like boomerangs.</p>
<p>I think this is still set in approximately the present day? The combat looks to be real-time. The key thing, the important thing is that Goro is having a lot of fun, bless him.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/">Steam page</a> helps clear the mists a little. Look, it's got a full-blown gosh-dang ship-sailing element! "Assemble a one-of-a-kind crew while upgrading your ship as you explore the open sea and forge your legend in the cannon fire of foes, unexpected friendships, and immense riches made along the way," explains the blurb. You can expect real-time cannon battles, boarding actions and hidden treasure islands.</p>
<p>As for the combat, there's a choice of at least two fighting styles. "With 'Mad Dog' style, utilize speed, agility, and flair to deliver precise yet powerful blows that stun your enemies into submission," the blurb goes on. "Or make enemies walk the plank with the 'Sea Dog' style that has you dual-wielding short swords and deploying tricky pirate tools to kick some serious booty." Three bits of pirate slang in one sentence, not bad. I can do better though: sink me, this is a haul worth hornswaggling a dungbie for, or my name's not Davey Jones's Locker.</p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii is out on 28th February 2025. I think I liked Goro better when he was an impossibly suave nightclub manager, but I welcome this new nautical phase in his career. If you're new to the sprawling LAD series, you might like to consult Ed Thorn's piece on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">the right order in which to play them</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These games have allowed players to import their choices from previous entries in order to keep a consistent world state that feels shaped, to some degree, by your actions. The process by which players do that has changed over the years, with the <em>Mass Effect </em>games reading your old saves and <em>Dragon Age </em>getting a separate app to craft your world state for <em>Inquisition</em>. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will handle this differently, allowing you to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-keep-choices-import-1851532520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-keep-choices-import-1851532520">make a few key decisions in the character creator</a></span> that reflect choices made in <em>Inquisition </em>before you get started on your next journey. Still, for all its apparent concern with making players feel like their decisions have lasting impact, BioWare’s track record is arguably a bit spotty in this regard, and at times the studio has outright undone the effects of major choices players have made.

This is a game about your decisions as a player. [...] The philosophy is we never want to invalidate your choices. And if we don’t feel we can do something respectful of the choice we made, we oftentimes just don’t necessarily reference it. [...] So we never want you to feel like your world is being invalidated.”</p><p>Most of <em>The Veilguard</em> takes place in the northern regions of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, whereas previous games have been primarily in southern areas like the countries of Ferelden and Orlais. As such, Epler said a lot of the decisions you made in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games won’t come into play, which means the studio didn’t have to write around or undo choices from your past adventures. This was also true of <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which took place in a different galaxy and only asked you if Commander Shepard, the protagonist of the first three games, was a man or woman.</p><p>The term “canon,” however, has also come to mean something different both with regard to BioWare games and the broader video game fandom, in that some people have taken to calling the “default” state you get when you boot up a game without changing something “canon.” However, this is a bit of a misnomer, and at least with BioWare, it sounds like a misconception within the community. <em>The Veilguard</em>, for example, lets you recreate your Inquisitor, the protagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and import some choices from previous games. When you boot up the character creator for the hero, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zevwardens/status/1836849390159548744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zevwardens/status/1836849390159548744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default version is an elven woman</a></span>. To long-time fans, this seems like it might be a nod to the only character who can enter a romance with Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em>-party-member-turned-<em>Veilguard</em>-antagonist. But this is just a default state for anyone who doesn’t care to change things to match their own world state, not a “canon” decision BioWare has deemed the “correct” choice.</p><p>With the studio recently working on both <em>The Veilguard </em>and the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">fifth <em>Mass Effect </em>game</a></span>, there’s been concern among some fans about just how the studio would navigate incorporating choices from earlier games. While we still know very little about the next <em>Mass Effect</em>, when it was revealed that it would feature a character from the original trilogy in squadmate Liara T’Soni, fans questioned whether or not the next game might make a hard decision about the state of the universe after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s galaxy-changing ending</a></span>. Some feel that BioWare just making a single decision and treating it as canon would be a simple solution, but I have been arguing for years that anyone who says BioWare should just pick an ending and make it canon for simplicity’s sake is not thinking hard enough. When meaningful choices are a fundamental part of a studio’s legacy, it feels flippant to say, “BioWare should just apply ending B to everyone’s story and call it a day.” So it’s comforting, as a long-time fan with a lot of investment in his characters and choices, to hear Epler so plainly say that’s not what the <em>Dragon Age </em>team is about. However, it is worth scrutinizing, as BioWare’s follow-through has been inconsistent.</p><p>Both <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age</em> have a habit of not necessarily outright contradicting player choice, but certainly writing around it in a way that makes what you did mostly irrelevant. <em>Dragon Age II</em> and<em> Inquisition</em> found ways to bring back party members like Anders and Leliana, even if they were ostensibly killed in <em>Origins</em>. The team explicitly addresses those contradictions (Anders was just presumed dead, Leliana was a ghost), but they were still sore spots for those who made certain decisions in previous games. BioWare has also used an assumed canon in spin-off materials like comics, anime, and novels.</p><p><em>Mass Effect </em>has been less egregious, but BioWare has found ways to write around player choice in the sequels, such as promoting Udina to the human councilor position in <em>ME3</em> even if you didn’t nominate him at the end of the first game, or still finding ways to include Rachni enemies in <em>ME3</em> even if you seemingly killed off the race of space bugs two games prior. Ultimately, I appreciate BioWare making this philosophy clear, I just hope it actually follows through when <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692">launches on October 31</a></span>, and I especially hope it extends beyond <em>Dragon Age </em>when the next <em>Mass Effect </em>game comes out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">sometime in the distant future</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Motion Twin, the creators of the popular Dead Cells, has released over 15 minutes of gameplay <a href="https://windblown.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for its new game</a> Windblown.</p>



<p>“Join us for the first 15 minutes of Single Player gameplay in Windblown,” the studio says in the description. “In this short (ish) video, we’ll take you through the basics, as you’ll experience what it’s like to step into the shoes of a Leaper for the very first time. </p>



<p>“We won’t spoil too much though, as you’ll need to dive into Windblown yourself later this year to see how fast you can really go!”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Windblown is an action roguelike centered around fast-pace movement on combat. According to Motion Twin, the game will feature unique weapons and abilities as well as combat that is “tough but always fair.”</p>



<p>In addition to being played solo, Windblown will allow for up to three-player co-op. Details on how the game’s co-op multiplayer will function will be revealed by Motion Twin in the future. </p>



<p>Windblown launches in PC early access later this year with a full release to come later on. A firm early access release date has yet to be revealed.</p>

                <p>Ever since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-palworld-and-its-massive-success/1100-6520490/" data-ref-id="1100-6520490">Palworld</a> was released earlier this year, it seemed inevitable that Nintendo would eventually go after the game for its similarities to Pokemon. The Pokemon Company even announced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-says-it-intends-to-investigate-palworld/1100-6520591/" data-ref-id="1100-6520591">intention to investigate Palworld</a> back in January. This week, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company finally went ahead and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">sued Palworld developer Pocketpair</a> for patent infringement instead of copyright infringement. And according to one analyst, this is a strategy that Nintendo has successfully used against rivals in the past.</p><p>Kantan Games CEO and video game analyst Serkan Toto spoke to <a href="https://www.404media.co/cold-blooded-business-nintendo-is-patent-trolling-palworld-because-it-got-too-big/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a> and noted that Nintendo used the same patent infringement tactics against Japanese mobile game developer Colopl in 2018. That eventually led to a<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nintendo-settles-five-year-court-battle-with-white-cat-project-developers/?ref=404media.co" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> $30 million settlement</a> in Nintendo's favor. Colopl now pays licensing fees to Nintendo to use some specific patents, and Toto believes that Pocketpair may eventually have to make its own deal with Nintendo.</p><p>"I think that the profit margin is probably sky high for Palworld and I think that Nintendo didn't like that one bit and said, 'Look, they're basically stealing our character designs,'" said Toto. "'We cannot do anything about this. So let's screw them with other things, like... patents that are very, very technical. The patents are not listed yet, so we don't know which patents. We don't know which patents Nintendo is actually talking about, but I bet with you already today that it's going to be highly, highly technical things."</p><p>Toto also predicts that Palworld will not be shut down by any future settlement, but he contends that the lawsuit was Nintendo's way of punishing Pocketpair for its success with its Pokemon-adjacent game.</p><p>"I think that Nintendo just saw these guys are getting too aggressive," added Toto. "Nintendo thinks Pocketpair is copying what they are doing, and before they even start distributing the PlayStation version or executing these IP expansion plans, Nintendo is going to spit in their bowl. I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business."</p><p>Pocketpair recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-wont-switch-over-to-live-service-model/1100-6526491/" data-ref-id="1100-6526491">it will not switch Palworld to a free-to-play or live-service model</a>. As Toto alluded to above, it's believed that Pocketpair will soon announce Palworld's PlayStation 5 port. Sony and Pocketpair have already teamed up for a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828"> Palworld merchandise deal</a> with an eye towards expanding the franchise beyond games.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We're all tired, but a college athlete probably shouldn't be overly fatigued after a half of a game. That's why EA Sports College Football 25 is addressing the Wear and Tear mechanic in a new title update that's now available. Additionally, the patch adds new nickel plays for defenses as well as fixes a kickoff exploit that benefited the kicking team.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-campus-huddle-title-update-september-19th-2024?utm_campaign=cf25_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_cfb25tu4&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82085&amp;ts=1726755831264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The EA Sports College Football 25 website</a> details everything new with the title update, which went live September 19. Saving custom audibles is now in the game, along with the previously mentioned tuning to Wear and Tear. A GameSpot editor noted that they would have to bench their running back in the second half sometimes because the mechanic was so harsh.</p><p dir="ltr">The new defensive plays are for nickel coverages and blitzing from the edges, as well as covering receiver formations where three players are stacked near each other. The update for EA Sports College Football 25 also hopefully ends a kickoff exploit that would ensure the receiving team doesn't catch the ball. A dev note states that this will be monitored going forward, with more changes possibly on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-patch-adds-new-on-field-fits-formations-and-bug-fixes/1100-6525628/" data-ref-id="1100-6525628">a EA Sports College Football 25 patch brought about new offensive shotgun formations</a> and behavioral adjustments to AI opponents.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249912/sony-ps5-final-fantasy-xvi-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday morning, Sony released a system update for the PlayStation 5 that may help with graphical bugs and crashes reported by <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> players after the <em>last </em>PS5 firmware update.</p><p>Sony <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">says today’s update</a> (version 24.06-10.01.00) simply improves “system software performance and stability” and doesn’t mention any specific fixes for the game. But a post shared on the official <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> X account earlier today says it’s been released “in response to the crashes and graphical bugs” reported by players.</p><p>Following the PS5 update released September 12th (24.06-10.00.00), people playing <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and some other games, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws, Death Stranding</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>, reported stutters and other issues. In<em> Final Fantasy, </em>players reported game crashes while loading save files or fast-traveling. Others experienced severe graphical issues, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/1fhe841/do_not_play_ff16_on_performance_mode_what_is_this/">black squares that would end up covering</a> large portions of the screen, making the game unplayable. </p><p>At the time, <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1835956338180214969">Square Enix said it was working</a> with Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) to determine what was causing the bugs and encouraged players to wait for further updates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
