              <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> latest update has given players plenty of new things to do, from grinding for new talismans to trying not to die to the new 9-star boss fights. But players on PC are still struggling with poor performance optimization, and Capcom now says no major fixes will be ready until the winter.</p> <p><span>“To our hunters playing <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </span><span>on PC, we’re committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game,” an update posted on X on August 18 <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">reads</a>. “Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards. We’ll share more information on the specifics in the future.”</span></p> <p>The response from fans so far has been less than stellar. “It’s not normal to wait one year to get at least a small optimization for PC players,” wrote one. “We are paying for stability and performance as the same time free updates. I have a war machine and i have to play everything on LOW hoping it’s going well.” Another posted, “Love MHWilds I really do, but waiting almost a year for the game to run at least a little better is a bit crazy.”</p>

 <p>Similar sentiments have been echoed across the game’s subreddit and recent Steam reviews where <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still sits at just 25 percent, up from an all-time low earlier in the summer, but still far from where the overwhelmingly positive ratings other recent entries in the series sit. While not everyone’s facing issues, people on a range of machines are still reporting crashes, ugly textures, and unstable framerates even at 30fps.</p> <p>There’s currently a new Title Update 3 scheduled for September to add a new monster and more balance adjustments to combat and progression, followed by Title Update 4 in the winter. There’s also the game’s first expansion, which new <em>Monster Hunter</em> entries tend to get 12-18 months after they ship. It’ll be a make-or-break moment for the players on PC who feel like the last six months have been closer to an Early Access experience.</p>

<p>The Helldivers 2 collaboration with Halo ODST is confirmed to arrive on the same day as the Xbox launch in the form of a Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>Initially released as a PlayStation and PC exclusive in February 2024, Helldivers 2 finally launches on Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, alongside a Halo-themed Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>This marks the first Legendary Warbond to release in Helldivers 2, and while Halo has previously been a Microsoft exclusive, the Legendary Warbond is available on all platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-launches-august-26">Helldivers 2 Halo ODST Legendary Warbond Launches August 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dropping in hot. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>As announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond lands on August 26 at 5am PT/1pm BST.</p>



<p>The Warbond is packed full of rewards, with a price of 1500 Super Credits. While Arrowhead notes this is “a step up” from previous Warbond prices, it is “packed with gear worthy of the legend.”</p>



<p>In the Warbond, players can unlock two Armor Sets, three primary weapons and a pistol that Halo fans will instantly recognise, and Mean Green patterns for the FRV, Exo Suit, Shuttle, and Hellpod to provide a true Master Chief-inspired look.</p>



<p>Arrowhead adds that the Legendary Warbond is not compatible with the new Premium Warbond Token launching August 26, included in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042063885789827083/1044696485985517638/1407350534578372649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Citizen Edition</a>, and advise making sure your Super Credits are locked and loaded if you want to unlock the content.</p>



<p>The Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST collab continues the growing relationship between PlayStation and Xbox, which has seen Microsoft release first-party exclusives on the rival console, while PlayStation has started to reciprocate with Helldivers 2 and Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

Developers like Supermassive Games and GenVid technologies have put money where their mouth is, developing methods for players to make collaborative choices in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Quarry</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill Ascension</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24054911/silent-hill-ascension-its-trauma-mug-t-shirt/">your mileage may vary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on how effective these systems were).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In any case, despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/amy-hennig-sees-a-social-future-for-storytelling-games">predictions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from leaders like Skydance co-president of new media Amy Hennig, collaborative choice-driven storytelling hasn't taken off. But just when that dream seemed dead, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Digixart revealed a new trailer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">at the PlayStation State of Play in June. The sci-fi action adventure game comes with a fascinating narrative twist: not only do players make branching narrative choices that shape their journey, the consequences of those choices will filter out into the game sessions of other players via an online connection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The system captures the payoff of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twitch Plays Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-style collective input without frustrating players who wanted to go in another direction. Those choices will shape the next players' choices, which will shape the next players' choices, and so on and so forth. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-makes-ambrosia-sky-so-unique-game-developer-podcast-ep-52" target="_self" data-discover="true">What Makes Ambrosia Sky So Unique? - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 52</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game also features a "ghost" system where players get short glimpses of other players navigating the same environment, a system made popular by the Dark Souls series and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does it take to create a system like this? According to Digixart producer Kevin Bard and game director Adam Michel, the team only conceived of the idea because they made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and executing it is only possible thanks to a very methodical pre-production process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To make good storytelling mechanics, you need a story worth telling">To make good storytelling mechanics, you need a story worth telling</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview, Bard and Michel stressed that Digixart's mission isn't just necessarily to experiment with narrative mechanics, it's to tell stories about themes directly tied to real-world conflicts. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was about escaping a totalitarian state, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides in Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is set in an oceanic post-apocalypse brought about by climate change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to do something about the climate crisis," said Michel. "That's what led to the weird setting of the game." He then explained that the seed of the multiplayer choice system was actually in a single-player system from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a procedurally-driven game where players run for the border multiple times. When players finished a run, they could leave unused money behind to benefit their next run.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/shuhei-yoshida-devs-in-emerging-markets-can-soar-with-authentically-crafted-titles" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shuhei Yoshida: Devs in emerging markets can soar with 'authentically crafted' titles</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was all single-player, but it sparked an idea which was 'what if it was not just yourself, but several different players following each other and playing one after the other, doing stuff for the next person?'" he said. (Michel did clarify he joined the team after many of these choices were made).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's where the pre-production process took over. The earliest version of this system was built in what Bard called a "prototext" (riffing on "prototype" in Unreal Engine). Digixart developers used this system to test choices and branching trees and how the consequences could filter to other game sessions, identifying what kind of choices were worth implementing, and others weren't.</span></p><p>Image via Digixart/THQ Nordic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The prototext generated quantitative data how often asynchronous choices would trigger in another player's session, and the team asked players to assess if if their runs were "enjoyable" and "clearly understandable." The choices that ranked highest sailed into production, the ones that didn't sank to the bottom of the ocean.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard said that Iterating on story choices, characters, and plot beats was "kind of the easiest" part. The trickiest part as production progressed was that players still to this day don't always understand how the asynchronous mechanics are impacting their games. "Some players never really understood. They were like 'okay, I see ghosts, I'm confused,'" he said, alluding to the "ghost" system showing brief snippets of of other players' game sessions."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Trump funding cuts 'devastate' video game research and development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Addressing that confusion required iterating on the UX design, like taking lessons from online role-playing games and having other players' names float over their heads when they appear in the game. "We're still iterating on that up until launch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another bit of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Road 96</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> inspiration that's also helped Digixart communicate the system to players: end-of-level choice rundowns. These were first made popular with Telltale Games' choice-driven adventure games that let players see what percentage of players made the same choices (before the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/telltale-games-initiates-majority-studio-closure-">went under</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/revived-telltale-games-nets-8-million-to-bring-first-titles-to-market">revived</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> those pages add in data about how other players' choices affected their run, and how their choices will impact other players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course there's also old-fashioned marketing.

The launch date trailer from June </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/43RMfZzY-M4?si=fqlbHU1nA-Ace64D">hammers that concept home</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The value of extensive pre-production">The value of extensive pre-production</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do game developers invest enough in pre-production? Depends who you ask. So much time has to go into the vertical slice or demo that goes in front of investors and publishers that by the time production is greenlit, it's questionable how much time the studio's had to plan out what the next few years of their life will look like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A good pre-production process for me is one where you don't have any remaining questions [afterward]," said Bard. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tides of Tomorrow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s pre-production was entirely focused on laying the groundwork for technical systems like first-person animation, boat physics, and online networking. It wasn't just a question of "does this work," it was also a question of "is this worth it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard explained that Digixart successfully prototyped a system where players could seamlessly travel from island to island without any in-game loading screens. "But then it was like—why the effort?", said Bard. They ditched that plan and went back to an fashioned loading screen. "That's way simpler and we can focus on what really matters."</span></p><p>Image via Digixart/THQ Nordic.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The unique selling point of the game is clearly the asynchronous system and the asynchronous story, so of course we simplified some stuff during the production to be 100% focused on that," added Michel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of this testing and iteration took place on one singular level, so that the team wouldn't rush into making too much content too fast that could be scrapped after production-led gameplay changes. Once the studio entered production, it immediately blocked out all the levels to act as a "skeleton" for the game. Now the team has a framework to anchor story elements—and asynchronous choices—around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Michel and Bard were transparent that even after all this work, some playtesters don't fully understand or even want to engage in the asynchronous choice system. They also face one untestable hurdle: what will happen when this system is dropped in front of millions of players shaping the flow of choices across different sessions? That question may mean experimental multiplayer system won't be "done" until after the game launches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bard said the best way to make sure the system works is to make sure the story on top of it is as compelling as possible."If you have a good story, if you have in the interesting characters [and] engaging stuff going on...no matter what crazy concept you have around it, they will still have a good time if the story is good."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s arrival on Xbox Series X/S next week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has revealed a Halo-themed Legendary Warbond - featuring a range of familiar equipment - that's heading to PS5 and PC too.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond (technically ODST stands for Orbital Drop Shock Troopers, but this is being jokingly reframed as Obedient Democracy Support Troopers in Helldivers 2), it launches alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform">game's Xbox release on 26th August</a>.

<p>
Legendary Warbonds cost 1,500 Super Credits (which can be found in-game or purchased with real money) and contain rewards gradually unlocked by playing. The crucial bit, though, is that Warbonds aren't time-limited, meaning players can unlock everything at their own pace. Here's what's included in the Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond, as per today's announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Weapons</strong>
<ul>
<li>MA5C Assault Rifle – An iconic rifle; the definition of reliable and having taken down countless aliens bent on wiping out humanity, it is time to turn its sights on enemies of Managed Democracy. It comes equipped with the convenient ammo counter and a built-in compass – let it guide you to victory.</li>
<li>M7S SMG – Silent and deadly, with caseless ammo and a non-removable suppressor; this weapon is ready to spread Freedom to every corner of the galaxy.</li>
<li>M90A Shotgun – This powerful shotgun carries a kick and has a handy flashlight mounted on it so you can see the fear in your enemies' eyes before you teach them a valuable lesson about Liberty.</li>
<li>M6C/SOCOM Pistol – They say keep your friends close and your sidearm closer. Well, we say that. The standard-issue ODST sidearm is your silent ally in the field – equipped with a built-in laser sight, flashlight, and, for the first time in Helldivers 2, a suppressor to support stealth gameplay. Because sometimes the best way to enforce Peace is quietly...</li>
</ul>
<strong>Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Armor</strong>
<ul>
<li>A-9 Helljumper – Debuted during the New Mombasa Armor Show, this sleek ensemble is sure to turn heads and blow minds.</li>
<li>A-35 Recon – Made famous by the Ministry of Intelligence's hide-and-seek-and-destroy champion of '52, this armor has been improved by removing excess shoulder protection.</li>
<li>Feet First Armor Passive – Applied to both the above armor sets, this passive allows your Helldiver Helljumper to make less noise when moving, become immune to leg injuries, and increases the range of discovering points of interest by 30 percent.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Capes and More</strong>
<ul>
<li>Honored Heirloom Cape – Should the wearer of this cape perish at the hands of Freedom’s enemies, it is customary to pass the cape on to their bravest child during the funeral, inspiring the next generation to take up arms.</li>
<li>Eye of the Clandestine Cape  – Those who serve Liberty from the shadows often elect to stay anonymous, moving like traceless spectres through the night. May they watch over us always.</li>
<li>More! – The Warbond will also include ODST-themed player cards, a new player title, "Rookie", and new vehicle pattern in a very familiar color known as Mean Green.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Manticore Games has released a new gameplay trailer for Out of Time, the anachronistic co-op roguelike shooter that is set to launch on 25th September, exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Out of Time Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8Iisl6CU6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Time and reality have been broken in Out of Time by an event known as The Shattering, blending anything and everything together in a mad mish-mash of periods, themes and technology. Depending on the different properties of each roguelike, you could be battling dragons, killer robots or mutant crabs, using medieval swords, plasma cannons, or riding dinosaurs.</p>
<p>There’s a whopping 24 characters to choose to play as, going from the Cyber Medic Yasmine, who features angel wings, to the purple skinned druid Talyndra, mobster Ming, and just a plain ol’ lumberjack named Freya. Each has specific starting abilities, weapons and skills, but comes without a defined class, so you’re free to customise beyond that. You will be pushed to co-operate though, as the game will push you to stay together beyond having complimentary abilities by a tethering system that shares healing and buffs between you.</p>

<p>There’s a shared space called Infinitopia before you head out on each run, with the game worlds taking you to various biomes and the promise that seasonal updates will evolve and change each space.</p>

<p>More specifically, <strong>22nd March 2026</strong> marks the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil on PS1. We're unsure what Capcom has in store for us to celebrate the milestone, but the website has a section marked 'Coming Soon' toward the bottom, so chances are the publisher has some big plans.</p>
<p>We do know one thing, however. 27th February 2026 will see the release of the latest mainline entry: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Currently, the title is not scheduled to launch on Switch 2, but given how much Capcom has supported the Switch over the years, we're not prepared to completely rule it out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, that's about it for now! We'll leave you with a look at two logos for the upcoming 30th anniversary; one designed to look like an archway encompassing the Umbrella logo, and the other quite literally depicting a raccoon wearing 30th anniversary shades. Badass.</p>

<p>Capcom recently provided updated sales figures for its best-selling titles, with half of the top ten games being Resident Evil titles. The best-selling of all time is currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a> remake, which is available on Switch as a Cloud download.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds PC Optimizations Coming in Winter, Capcom Promises]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-coming-in-winter-capcom-promises.1273599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that PC optimizations are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>later this year, likely in an attempt to combat the negative feedback the game has been receiving for its PC version in recent months.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Capcom says that Title Update 4, which is on the way this winter (but which won't be the game's next major update, with Title Update 3 still yet to arrive), will bring "CPU and GPU related optimizations".</p>

<p>This round of improvements will be followed by "a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards". It's all part of what the developer and publisher calls a "multifaceted plan" to improve&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=Qa2QenZK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=-iLU-It7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Presumably because the PC port could give up at any minute.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom says it'll share more specifics about the optimizations in question "in the future", and that "gradual improvements" will also be implemented in the weeks ahead as part of other updates.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>&nbsp;launched back in February to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">pretty rapturous</a> (or perhaps that should be "raptor"ous) sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">reception</a>, but players bemoaned its PC performance, with many reporting serious issues even on high-end machines.</p>

<p>In the last couple of months, those criticisms have become even louder, with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>dipping to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam. A quick glance at the negative reviews accruing on the game's page shows that PC performance is still a huge point of contention.</p>

<p>Still, there's reason to be optimistic that Capcom will fix&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' PC problems. Another big problem players brought up was the game's lack of endgame content, and Capcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1021-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">recently released an update</a> to address that issue, so hopefully, Title Update 4 will do the same for players' PC woes.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shinobi-art-of-vengeance/">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a> is due out later this month, and now <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1957457668689260742" rel="nofollow ">Sega has announced</a> a fun if surprising bit of DLC that's coming "early 2026." Dubbed the Sega Villains Stage, details are still pretty light on the DLC, but Sonic the Hedgehog's Dr. Eggman is set to appear as a boss fight. Alongside that, protagonist Joe Musashi will have two other guest villains to take on, though they are yet to be revealed. If you're picking up the digital deluxe edition of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, you'll automatically unlock it whenever the DLC does arrive next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega also announced that Young Dirty Bastard (YDB), i.e. the son of the late Ol' Dirty Bastard from Wu-Tang Clan, is releasing a song called The Path Has Just Begun inspired by the Shinobi series. It'll be released on streaming services this week, August 21, and you can expect a new trailer for the game on the same day.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">teased back at The Game Awards in 2023</a> before getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-reveals-new-shinobi-game-art-of-vengance-during-february-2025s-state-of-play/1100-6529458/" data-ref-id="1100-6529458">proper reveal earlier this year</a>, bringing the series back to its roots with 2D action-platforming. It's also the first new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi 3D, a 3DS title that received average reviews at the time. This new Shinobi game comes as part of a broader move by Sega to bring back some of its legacy titles that haven't received a new entry in many years, like Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. A movie adaptation of the Shinobi series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sega-arcade-game-lands-director-for-a-new-movie/1100-6527028/">also in the works</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to pick up Shinobi: Art of Vengeance on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC when it launches on August 29.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another reputable insider, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957613059356217831" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, said on social media that "it's not jetpacks lol." Instead, what's seen in the video is a "mega jump upgrade from the campaign," apparently.</p><p>The original video <a href="https://x.com/tu_nikal_/status/1957655348481012029" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remains online if you know where to look.</a></p><p>More details about Black Ops 7 should be announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live today beginning at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET. Some of the surprises may have been spoiled already, though, including this gameplay video and the game's reported price and release date. According to reliable source <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1957017550044168449" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, the game will be priced at $70 for its standard edition and will launch on November 14.</p><p>The price being below $70 is not a surprise, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">already did a U-turn on its plans to charge $80 for games this year.</a> Like Black Ops 6 in 2024, Black Ops 7 will be available at launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>Black Ops 7's development is being led by Raven Software and Treyarch, the same two co-lead developers on last year's Black Ops 6. This is the first time ever that Activision is releasing Black Ops games in consecutive years.</p><p>Recently, a report said Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-blend-the-campaign-and-multiplayer-like-never-before-report/1100-6533962/" data-ref-id="1100-6533962">final campaign mission will morph into a 32-player extraction-style multiplayer mode.</a></p><p>If the rumored November 14 release date for Black Ops 7 is real, that's about a month after EA's highly anticipated Battlefield 6 is set to launch on October 10. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">just wrapped up its second and final open beta test</a>, and it was hugely popular.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is finally poised to make a debut on Xbox, which means there are a bunch of achievements to grind towards. Here, we’ve got details of them all.</p>



<p>Releasing on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 20</a>, albeit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not on the Xbox Game Pass service</a>, it’s been a long year of waiting for the title that was previously a PlayStation console timed-exclusive, but there’s still every reason to be excited.</p>



<p>If you’re planning on working your way through Black Myth: Wukong to gather every achievement and secure all the Gamerscore available, we’ve got the complete list for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-myth-wukong-achievements">All Black Myth: Wukong Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Finally here. Image via Game Science.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong’s list of achievements will have you ticking off challenges of every type, though the descriptions can be rather mysterious.</strong></p>



<p>Rather than provide a detailed breakdown of the task at hand, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/black-myth-wukong/9NWQ1Q1FR0C9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Myth: Wukong</a> keeps its cards close to its chest, with all the achievements having a sort of riddle to solve. Some are easier to crack than others, and some become clearer while playing the game.</p>



<p>The table below has all the achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, excluding the secret achievements (more on those later).</p>

<h2 id="h-all-black-myth-wukong-secret-achievements">All Black Myth: Wukong Secret Achievements</h2>



<p><strong>The majority of Black Myth: Wukong achievements are secret, and the description won’t show unless manually revealed. Therefore, spoilers follow here.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, however, revealing the description of the secret achievements doesn’t necessarily make them spoiled, as the riddles will keep you on your toes. </p>

                <p>In November, the Xbox Series X|S console will have been around for five years. Naturally, there has been talk about the next generation of Xbox consoles, and Microsoft recently spoke about what it envisions for its future hardware and its idea of a player-first environment that will follow players across multiple devices.</p><p>Speaking on the Official Xbox Podcast, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald explained how the company is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem across multiple devices in the future. "When we think about the future of the Xbox, we're really focused on how do we put the player at the center of the experience, and when you really look at how modern players play games today, the vast majority play across multiple different devices," Ronald said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biXDUvQByBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the VP, Microsoft envisions players having options like the Xbox ROG Ally for when they're on the move, and dedicated hardware when they come home that'll allow them to pick up from right where they left off.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said. "So it's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center."</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">what we do know about the next-gen Xbox</a> is that it'll be powered by AMD technology, which Microsoft says will be able to allow for a "deeper level of visual quality" with "immersive gameplay" that's "enhanced" with the power of AI. The company also hinted at games not being "locked to a single store" or only supported on a single device, and in February, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the in-development console will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><p>On the handheld side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">the Xbox ROG Ally will launch during the holiday season</a> and there'll be two models to choose from. The ROG Xbox Ally X has a black color scheme and is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chipset, 24GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, while the base model ROG Xbox Ally is white and has an AMD Ryzen Z2A chipset, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Pricing for these units haven't been officially revealed yet, but recent leaks claim that the premium "X" model could cost as much as $1,050, while the ROG Xbox Ally is rumored to be $699.</p>

            <p>
It's been a busy couple of week in Nintendo presentation land. First we had that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">third-party-focused partner showcase</a>, then it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-indie-world-showcase-heres-everything-announced">turn of the indies</a>, leaving everyone to speculate that a proper Direct showcase much <em>surely</em> be on the way. And, well, here we are, sort of. Today's 45-minute Direct is apparently focused exclusively on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming Kirby Air Riders - and if that appeals, here's where you'll be able to watch it unfold.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Kirby Air Riders Direct officially gets underway today, 19th August, at 2pm BST. That's 3pm CEST for our European chums, and 6am PDT/9am EDT/7am MDT/8am CDT for anyone over in the US. And, yes, you did read that right earlier; Nintendo has confirmed we're in for a full 45 minutes focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders - which seems like a lot considering it managed to squeeze its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct into less than 18 minutes.

<p>
As you might expect, today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn5c4RkoYAc">Kirby Air Riders Direct airs on YouTube</a> and promises an "in-depth look" at the game, as presented by its director, the legendary Masahiro Sakurai - who also created its underrated 2003 predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, alongside the considerably more fondly remembered Smash Bros. series.
</p>
<p>

And if you need a reminder, all we've seen of Kirby Air Riders so far is its announcement trailer from back in April, which you can watch below while we await today's full Direct reveal.

            <title><![CDATA[Safe In Our World Launches Industry-First Gaming Mental Health Accreditation]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-star-accreditation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/safe-in-our-world-launches-industry-first-gaming-mental-health-accreditation.1273554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming mental health charity Safe In Our World has launched the Mental Health Star Accreditation, an industry-first method to help gaming industry companies and studios shore up their efforts when it comes to employee mental health.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Mental Health Star Accreditation is "designed to provide companies with the opportunity to achieve a mark of excellence in workplace wellbeing", something that's sorely needed in today's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">uncertain</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">volatile</a>, and often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">seemingly cruel</a> industry.</p>

<p>If a company chooses to undergo the process of accreditation, it will first be audited by Safe In Our World; the charity says it'll carry out a "company-wide audit of mental health policies, practices, culture, and sentiment".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-accreditation-star.jpg?itok=ymPCBpfD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-accreditation-star.jpg?itok=ajXDgoBG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Safe In Our World's new Mental Health Star accreditation aims to bolster companies' efforts to support mental health initiatives.</figcaption></figure><p>Using the data gathered from that audit, Safe In Our World then puts together a report that will tell a company what it's doing well to support its employees' mental health, as well as what could be done better.</p>

<p>If a company successfully completes the accreditation, they'll be awarded with one of three tiers: Dedicated, Accomplished, or Outstanding, depending on how satisfied Safe In Our World is with the company's performance.</p>

<p>Each accreditation lasts three years and comes complete with "annual check-ins and support" from the charity, as well as badges and other media assets for companies to display on their platforms to show off their achievement.</p>

<p>Companies that don't succeed in attaining the accreditation will be provided with a "thorough and detailed report" regarding why they didn't make the cut, as well as "practical advice and resources to aid improvement". They'll also be able to re-apply whenever they like.</p>




<p>Mental health remains a serious issue when it comes to the gaming industry, especially when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">even employees of massive gaming corporations</a> could find themselves in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">layoff firing line</a> with very little warning.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the Mental Health Star Accreditation is adopted en masse by the industry, but if you ask me, it's a much-needed step in the right direction for protecting employee mental health. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Mitch William Gross, a 34-year-old man from Earling, Iowa, is about to spend four months in federal prison for the crime of buying $145,000 worth of <em>Pokémon</em> cards and gaming items. The mistake he made was to buy them by defrauding the logistics company he worked for.</p> <p>It’s a tale as old as time itself. Man works for transportation corporation, man uses company credit cards to buy tens of thousands of dollars on <em>Pokémon</em> cards, man falsifies receipts on expense reports to make the payments appear as regular business costs, man gets caught by the FBI and charged with wire fraud. We’ve all been there at one time or another.</p> <p>Mitch William Gross managed to rack up an extraordinary $146,590.15 in fraudulent purchases, which <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdia/pr/earling-man-sentenced-four-months-federal-prison-wire-fraud">the Southern District of Iowa’s Attorney’s Office</a> said (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ktiv.com/2025/08/18/iowa-man-spent-140k-company-funds-pokemon-cards-gaming-items/"><em>KTIV</em></a>) were spent on “prepaid gift cards, <em>Pokémon</em> cards, and gaming items.” He is then said to have “submitted falsified receipts and mischaracterized fraudulent charges on his expense reports so that the purchases appeared as legitimate business expenses.”</p>

 <p>As a result of an investigation by the FBI and Des Moines Police Department, Gross has been ordered to repay the full amount of his elicit shopping, as well as serving four months in a federal prison,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>three further years of post-release supervision. The report notes, “There is no parole in the federal system.”</p> <p>As is all too often the case in these circumstances, we don’t have the key information: which <em>Pokémon</em> cards did he buy? Was this one big spend on a rare Charizard, or did he pick up a wealth of booster boxes? (The crimes all took place between September 2021 and October 2022, back in the glory days <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">when you could buy Pokémon cards in stores</a>.)</p> <p>Gross pleaded guilty back in April, and was sentenced in the past couple of days. If he kept the <em>Pokémon</em> cards, he could sell them now four about five times whatever he paid.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is right around the corner, bringing the franchise to PlayStation players for the first time, and the full achievement and trophy list is available.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-gears-of-war-reloaded-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review embargo lifting on the same date</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded rolls the franchise back to the very beginning and will raise attention ahead of the release prequel title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-release-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: E-Day next year</a>.</p>



<p>That means there’s plenty of time to achieve full completion of Gears of War: Reloaded before the next instalment releases, and we’ve got the details of every task you need to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-gears-of-war-reloaded-achievements-amp-trophies">All Gears of War: Reloaded Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>

<p><strong>Unlocking all the achievements and trophies in Gears of War: Reloaded requires mastering all game modes, including completing the campaign on the highest difficulty and killing 10,000 enemies in multiplayer.</strong></p>



<p>If the list below looks familiar, it’s because the achievement and trophy list is the exact same as it is in <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gears of War</a>: Ultimate Edition. While that may be disappointing for Xbox players who have done the grind before, it’s the first time for PlayStation trophy-hunters to join the fray.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 56 achievements with a total of 1,250 Gamerscore to earn on Xbox, while there are 57 trophies to hunt on PlayStation—including the illustrious Platinum trophy for 100% completion.</strong></p>



<p>The collection is split with the usual mix of low-earning Gamerscore achievements and Bronze trophies, alongside higher rewards and rarer trophies. As mentioned, you’ll have to become a master of all modes.</p>



<p>At the very least, you’ll need to complete the game in co-op, complete the game on Insane Difficulty, and kill 10,000 enemies online. If you can tick off those three, you’ll probably be very close to full completion.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed that the Gears of War: Reloaded achievement and trophy list is the same as Gears of War: Ultimate Edition? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>The games set to leave PlayStation Plus Extra in September have been revealed. The eight titles include some very good games, so you might want to make some time before 16th September to get them played.</p>
<p>As these games are part of the Game Catalogue and not the monthly games that you claim as part of PS Plus Essential, these games will no longer be playable from 16th September even if they are in your library.</p>
<p>Leaving PS Plus Extra on 16th September:</p>
<ul>
<li>UFC 5 (PS5)</li>
<li>The Plucky Squire (PS5)</li>
<li>Night in the Woods (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Road 96 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Pistol Whip (PSVR2)</li>
<li>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir (PS4)</li>
<li>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Dragon's Crown Pro (PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the bunch, I'd certainly recommend FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch, especially if you are partial to a Metroidvania. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pistol-whip">Pistol Whip</a> is superb if you have PS VR2, and the Plucky Squire is definitely worth a look even though it didn't quite live up to pre-launch expectations. Night in the Woods is also excellent.</p><p>In fact, why stop there... Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir and Dragon's Crown Pro are also very good games. So, really, what I'm saying is, don't rush to play UFC 5 (which is fine, but just more UFC) or Road 96 (didn't enjoy the writing on this, unfortunately), but all the others are worth your time.</p>

            <p>Gears of War creator Cliff 'CliffyB' Bleszinski is "thrilled" more people will be able to experience the original game when it arrives on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is set to be released later this month, on 26th August, across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's a revamped edition of the original Gears of War, which first debuted on Xbox almost 20 years ago (yes, it has really been that long). </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">upcoming souped up version will come complete with faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity"</a>, and while he hasn't had a hand in it personally, Bleszinski is delighted that soon those on PlayStation will finally be able to experience the first Gears of War game for themselves.</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel strange," Bleszinski told Eurogamer when asked if it will be odd seeing the once Xbox exclusive popping up on Sony's newest consoles. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>The series creator added he is "asked nearly every day on social media" to return to Gears of War. "And I'm like 'uh, I've said it a thousand times I'm open to consult on any of it'," Bleszinski said, before closing:</p>

<p>"Crickets. On to the next!"</p>
<p>Along with his legacy in video games, Bleszinski is also a Broadway producer, restaurant owner and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliffyb-says-series-needs-a-god-of-war-style-reboot">comic book creator</a>.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War, in addition to this month's Reloaded release there's also a new series entry in the works. It's known as Gears of War: E-Day, and will be a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>.</p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. "We are so back," a post announcing their inclusion teased.</p>

            <p>True to the game's billing as the twistiest of duty-shooters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release date trailer appears to have leaked ahead of a possible <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> showing tonight. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will launch on 14th November, close to a month after rival Battlefield 6's release on October 10th. Also, it appears to have jet packs and mechs.</p><!--more-->
<p>The leak comes care of that ever-dependable source of military intelligence, a video advertisement that seems to have been accidentally published early. The ad has now been removed, but not before CharlieIntel spotted it and shared it on the Xeetbox, along with some <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1957614174768689197?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">thoughts based on the user's own pre-release access</a>. "Just to tone down expectations, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 does not have jet packs or double jumps as part of its movement," CharlieIntel claims. Alas for Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a> players. Good news, I guess, for people who relish the 'omnimovement' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what we know of Call of Duty: Bleven for sure: it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">requires secure boot, to avoid cheaters</a>. It's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>. The campaign is set in 2035, hence the mechs and jet packs, and expands upon the global calamities unleashed in Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. It sees grizzly grumbleface David Mason chasing after an enigmatic new foe who "weaponise fear". There will probably be hallucinations and other Manchurian Candidate-esque horseplay to wash down the gadgets and gunnery.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/leaked-black-ops-7-video-features-mechs-jet-packs-and-a-release-date/">reported by VGC</a>, today's release date whoopsie corroborates a previous leak that also included a price tag for the Standard Edition - $70 or €80 - with a Vault Edition priced at $100 or €110. If legit, this means that Microsoft has still yet to cross the Rubicon and raise the game's base US price to $80, as they tried to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">until the internet started screaming at them</a>.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has announced that its RTX Hair feature will be added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on September 4. In a nutshell, RTX Hair uses Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS) to improve lighting and shadows in video game hair, which Nvidia says is a solution that doesn't require a lot of extra memory as opposed to using triangles to render hair for every frame.</p><p>By using linear swept spheres, hair will look more realistic because the geometry is naturally round, thus making it easier to avoid self-intersection when casting shadow and reflection rays. This will allow Harrison Ford's digital doppelganger in the Indiana Jones game to sport a fuller head of hair when the update to the real-time path tracing mode arrives next month. The feature will be available to RTX-50 series GPUs, and earlier this year, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/render-path-traced-hair-in-real-time-with-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus/" rel="nofollow ">Nvidia added</a> that this is a "big step toward rendering high-quality digital humans" in real time.</p>

      </div>
<p>Hair and related elements like fur have been one of the more challenging things to accurately render in video games over the years. Fortunately, great strides have been made over the years as video game characters went from having what looked like static blobs of meat for hairdos--or buzz-cuts for many protagonists throughout the 2000s and early 2010s--to longer hair that moved realistically during gameplay.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched last year for PC and Xbox Series X|S--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">and in April 2025 for PS5</a>--and September will see the arrival of its expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-dlc-the-order-of-giants-coming-in-september/1100-6532248/" data-ref-id="1100-6532248">The Order of Giants</a>. The DLC will see Dr. Jones embark on an expedition to uncover the secrets of the Nephilim Order.</p>

<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place on Wednesday, August 20, the day after Opening Night Live, with a host of new reveals and news.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a host of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several Future Games Show streams, though the main one is on Wednesday.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place at 8pm CEST, which is 11am PT. We’ve got a full breakdown of timezones below.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will start bang on time, with no countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in ahead of time. If you do miss any announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Check out the table below to see the start time of Future Games Show in your timezone.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How to Watch Future Games Show at Gamescom</h2>



<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom will be available to watch directly on YouTube and Twitch, along with TikTok, and plenty of other streaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>From experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/futuregamesshow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow the live stream as it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZVRK-bSdkjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, so if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly recommend watching via Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform works for you, though, and keep Insider Gaming open to track all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show takes place on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, the home of the event.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will be hosted by David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid franchise, and Maggie Robertson, the star behind Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil: Village. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How Long is Future Games Show at Gamescom?</h2>



<p><strong>The main Future Games Show stream is 90 minutes long, though it will be immediately followed by FGS Live, a 40-minute show with additional trailers and reveals.</strong></p>



<p>Given the show is set to be action-packed from beginning to end, I’d advise making sure you have everything you need to lock in for over two hours so you don’t miss any of the reveals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Let’s be clear, the Grand is definitely not haunted, but that doesn’t go for other parts of the British seaside town. There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is a truly quirky mix of ideas, a real hodge-podge that blends hotel renovations, slice-of-life storytelling, horror mysteries and even reggae-infused musical numbers into something that’s quite unique.</p>
<p>The Gamescom 2025 demo –&nbsp;playable at the Xbox booth this week –&nbsp;follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/no-ghosts-at-the-grand-is-a-musical-supernatural-hotel-renovator-with-a-talking-cat/">the game’s appearance during Microsoft’s summer showcase</a>, and gives a great serving of each of the game’s elements to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="There are No Ghosts at the Grand Xbox Showcase Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-TaSv2hL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It starts with a bit of light renovation, as you look to refurnish and spruce up part of the lobby of the hotel that Chris David has just inherited. It’s in a bit of a state, but thankfully the multi-purpose DIY gun and the thoroughly helpful Robert C McBrushy is on hand to guide you through it. He’s a funny little AI DIY mascot, imbued with bags of personality thanks to the decidedly human writing that goes into his being. He’s sure to be a great source of humour and quirky oddities deep into the game.</p>
<p>The gun has multiple modes, right off the bat. A sandblaster can be used to basically shoot old wallpaper off and get back to the plaster underneath, ready for a very forgiving painting mode to spray and shoot globs of patterned paint at the wall – both of these modes autocompleting after you’ve dealt with around 80–90% of a section, and will neatly target through obstacles. A vacuum mode will scoop up plenty of large debris, and a furniture mode can pick up reorient the tumbled furniture and even hang paintings on the wall. Each mode has its own ping function to highlight what’s left to do. It’s all very slick and easy to get to grips with, and honestly, if this weren’t a physics-defying impossibility, I reckon Friday Sundae would make a killing on Dragons Den.</p>


<p>But there’s so much more to this game than just decorating. Miss Green, the town’s mayor hassles you until you answer the ancient Nokia-like brick phone, asking you to come out and help with a little something else around town? It turns out that there’s a mysterious black slime that’s been appearing on the beaches, and she thinks that it could be tracked, quite logically, to an old WW2 installation on the nearby Crammond Island.</p>
<p>So — much to McBrushy’s dismay — you drop what you were doing, hop onto her moped with her and her cat, Mr. Bones, and pootle along to the jetty, driving through some lovely autumnal scenery as you go, and even offroading down the path to get down to the sea shore.</p>
<p>The boat’s an absolute state, though, and needs a bit of help to get it into working order, with McBrushy more than willing to help. It gets even worse when you crash it into Crammond Island after a sudden fog rolls in. You can use the furniture grabber to pick up items like the front crane, railings and buoys to reattach them to the boat, while the vacuum gains a new feature to repurpose certain types of debris to fix up broken sections of hull or even create new furniture.</p>
<p>But getting to the island is an area where There Are No Ghosts at the Grand showcases its most distinctive element. Miss Green has a real chip on her shoulder about you taking over the hotel, stating that it really should be given over to the town to become a tourist attraction instead of being in your hands to mess around with and modernise — she expects the worst of Chris, since he is an American.</p>

<p>Her grousing bursts into song as you take to the water and pilot the boat through checkpoints, which I let wash over me while watching the demo be played by writer and game director Anil Glendinning — I rarely listen closely to song lyrics, and instead just appreciate a good tune, with her music having a bit of a folk reggae fusion to it. Each character in the game has their own theme tune and songs to unlock as you progress through the story, but it’s really all a part of the game’s dialogue system and relationships.</p>
<p>Where many video game dramas will give you dialogue options, here you’re given song options, the ability to respond with a verse of Chris’s own, bouncing the lyrics down a different path as the character then responds in kind. Each character has a relationship meter for you to build up, both through dialogue and completing tasks and missions, and this does feed into the game’s overarching narrative and some of the endings that will become available to you.</p>
<p>The team are aiming for a game that’s around 8–10 hours to complete, but there will be plenty of side content, people and jobs to take on. You’ll be redecorating so much more than the Grand in this… including a WW2 bunker, it turns out.</p>
<p>Stranded on the island and forced to wait for the low tide when a land bridge will appear, Chris has to make the best of the situation and spruce up a corner of the bunker to be a little bedroom. Anil went for more of a pink and flowery princess bedroom style here, with dressers, ornate lights, bright and colourful wallpaper, but you can obviously take it in some very different directions.</p>

<p>But suddenly there’s a sound. Miss Green said The Grand’s not haunted, but what about this island? Exploring the bunker reveals a shimmering ball of gold that expands as you get near, with humanoid forms within. It’s a memory, a portal back to historical events and people that you need to engage with in a number of ways to fix the scene and nudge the story along. McBrushy comes in all handy yet again, letting you move items back into place, to blast out-of-place boxes, and the other usual things. It gives a peek back into what the bunker’s true purpose was, though really you’re only left with more questions as you delve deeper and deeper into the bunker…. ably helped by McBrushy adding a little…. atmosphere.</p>

<p>Oh, and then Mr. Bones starts talking to you. What’s that? A talking cat? While he loves a good scratch and tickle round the ears during the day, eagerly hopping into moped basket and boat window to appreciate the journey, at night he speaks with an Aussie accent and encourages you as the more bizarre and surreal Lovecraftian horrors take hold.</p>
<p>Emerging from the bunker’s tunnels in another part of the island, you come across a bunch of red plush chairs set about the place. How charmingly odd, you might think, but you won’t for long. Mr. Bones hurries you along, cautioning you not to get too close — either way, they suddenly sprout extra legs and eyes and start chasing you, while McBrushy transforms into an actual gun to let you get blasting.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty wild turn, but just hints at the many more barmy twists and supernatural goings on that you’ll encounter through There Are No Ghosts at the Grand. After the music-filled announcement and the otherworldly twists that tail-ended that trailer, seeing the game in action, with the oh-so-easy to use redecorating tools, the characters and the ways that they’re brought together in inventive ways is a true delight. There Are No Ghosts at the Grand deserves its place on your wishlist for 2026.</p>

<p>There's just one thing bugging us...</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Gulikit - ES | ES PRO 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2304f4170f9b1/gulikit-es-es-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Gulikit has launched a new range of budget controllers with Switch 2 wake-up support.</p>
<p>The ES and ES PRO Wireless Controllers are out now and priced at <strong>£24.99 / $24.99</strong> and <strong>£29.99 / $29.99</strong> respectively (exchange rates working wonders there, we see). Aesthetically, both models are pretty similar and seem to be based on the overall design of the Xbox controller, with off-set concave analogue sticks, a faceted d-pad, and an almost identical shape.</p>
<p>The ES PRO comes in black or white, while the standard ES is more of a light grey colour with matching sticks and face buttons.</p>
<p>As for the specific features, the ES boasts Hall Effect sticks, while the ES PRO comes rocking 4000-level TMR anti-drift joysticks. Gyro aiming is supported along with d-pad directional adjustment, various vibration settings, and face button re-mapping.</p>
<p>The latter seems particularly important, since there's one thing about the ES and ES PRO that's bugging us. You've probably noticed it already, right..? Yes, the ABXY layout isn't suited to the Switch out of the box. They're the wrong way around! Oof, vexing... Still, the ability to re-map will likely resolve this issue, and let's face it, nobody stares down at their controller whilst playing a game. For the relatively cheap price, it's something we can probably forgive.</p>

                <p>Aggro Crab has finally revealed the answer to a question we've all been asking about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a>, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">surprise hit co-op climbing </a>collab with Landfall--is Bing Bong sentient?</p><p>The answer is yes, or at least, he used to be. The studio revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kgWKv_iQ1Vg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent video</a> that developers used to possess Bing Bong to talk to streamers, but no longer will be doing so. In a video that shows a look behind the curtain, Aggro Crab revealed that devs would talk to players through Bing Bong, but only in cases where they were publicly sharing their game.</p><p>"It was a really funny way to give creators a wild experience in the first few weeks of us releasing Peak," the video explains. Aggro Crab also clarifies that devs weren't able to join private games, and that talking Bing Bong was only really present in those first few weeks. "We removed this feature mid-June, so if you are seeing anyone claiming that the devs are joining them through Bing Bong or any other way, they're full of sh**."</p><p>Bing Bong, a lumpy green plushie, is found on the crashed plane at the start of Peak. Even though he may no longer be sentient, he has become something of a mascot for the game, and many players give up precious pack space just to cart him to the top of the mountain.</p><p>This kind of direct interaction with streamers isn't out of character for Landfall--on the studio's previous title Clustertruck, the developers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB7xRFTlahU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"hacked" a version of the game</a> being run at Summer Games Done Quick, interacting with the speedrunner through messages on the screen and modifying game visuals on the fly.</p><p>Peak has been surprisingly successful for a game developed largely in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/" data-ref-id="1100-6532754">one-month game jam</a>, selling over a million copies in its first week and continuing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aptly-named-co-op-climbing-game-peak-continues-to-scale-past-higher-and-higher-all-time-peak-player-counts/1100-6533021/" data-ref-id="1100-6533021">reach higher player peaks</a> over time. The game is receiving regular updates, with the latest update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">adding the new Mesa biome</a>, and the one before that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">implementing cannibalism</a>.</p>

                <p>Despite the legendary dragon Pokemon's popularity, a large number of Pokemon fans are going around pronouncing Rayquaza's name wrong--and The Pokemon Company is trying to teach us how it's actually said.</p><p>If you use the common pronunciation of ray-KWAH-zuh, you would be incorrect according to official sources. A reminder of this--and the correct pronunciation--was popped up on the big screen at the Pokemon World Championships 2025 over the weekend, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-weve-been-saying-this-pokemons-name-wrong-all-these-years" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reports</a>. According to the "mispronounced Pokemon" graphic shared by The Pokemon Company, the correct pronunciation is ray-KWAY-zuh, sounding closer to the word quasar.</p><p>While some fans reacted with shock to the official pronunciation, others flat-out refuse to adopt it. The iconic legendary has been around for a long time, making its first appearance in 2002's Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, before becoming the mascot Pokemon for Pokemon Emerald two years later. Having been a part of the series for over two decades, it's no wonder players would refuse to change how they've been pronouncing Rayquaza all this time.</p><p>Of course, some fans on social media point out that they already use the correct pronunciation, which is used more often than not in Rayquaza's infrequent but memorable appearances in the Pokemon anime.</p><p>The next big Pokemon release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and while the game has more of a focus on Mega Evolutions as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/" data-ref-id="1100-6533977">major combat shakeup</a>, it's not clear if fan-favorite Mega Rayquaza will be making an appearance.</p>
