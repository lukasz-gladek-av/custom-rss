            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-originally-switch-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that&nbsp;Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally in development for the first Switch, and that the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC is the reason the game ended up on Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant's latest Ask the Developer article is all about the new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game, which launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>. It turns out, though, that Nintendo began prototyping&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>all the way back in 2017.</p>

<p>According to producer Kosuke Yabuki, work on&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>began in March 2017, a month or so before the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Programming director Kenta Sato says the original plan was to develop for the Switch, but that this threw up a lot of technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=9F4aF8SX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=qtH1RAF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally intended as a Switch game.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, Sato says there were doubts about whether the original Switch was capable of accommodating&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s 24-player limit. The team discussed various solutions, including "toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and...dropping the frame rate to 30fps".</p>

<p>Yabuki says that the team "kick[ed] the can down the road" while trying to work out what to compromise on for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but that when&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC was released, it gave the team "a bit more time to continue development".</p>

<p>During that time, the development team discussed moving&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>to the Switch 2, which became, as Yabuki puts it, "a ray of hope", opening up "a bunch of possibilities" and removing the need to compromise on performance or visual fidelity.</p>




<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">just one of the games</a> that will be available for the system on release, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and the bafflingly paid-for&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-massively-outsold-the-original-oblivion-in-the-us-in-its-first-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</a> launched in a not-so-surprising shadow drop at the tail end of the month, and in just one week managed to vastly outsell the original Oblivion's first 15 months on the market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana, which reports that Oblivion was not just the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month of April in dollar sales, and the third best-selling game of 2025 so far, it also sold more units in April than the original Oblivion managed in its first 15 months, and brought in more money than the original Oblivion did in its first 14 months. While that's admittedly not a huge shock given the massively larger install base Oblivion sold into now compared to 2006, it's still an incredible feat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remainder of April's top 20 present some fascinating twists on the usual suspects we see on the charts. In second place for the month was Forza Horizon 5, up from No.42 last month due to its PS5 launch. Following it is MLB: The Show 25 at No.3, and then Minecraft at No.4, up from No.11 and almost certainly riding a high from the release of the Minecraft movie earlier in April.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At No.5 was last month's winner, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, and it's followed by Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at No.6. It's up from No.118 last month thanks to, like Forza, its PS5 release. As Circana analyst Mat Piscatella notes, four of the top five — and five of the top seven — best-selling games of the month on PlayStation platforms were published by Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out that The Last of Us: Part 2 jumped from No.23 to No.13 this month, possibly due to the second season of the TV show. And while Schedule 1 doesn't appear on the sales charts, it did rank No.1 in U.S. total monthly active users on Steam (Call of Duty topped the MAU charts on PlayStation and Xbox).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're an RPG fan, you might be wondering where the heck <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is. Per Piscatella, publisher Kepler Interactive doesn't share digital data with Circana, and thus Expedition 33's digital sales aren't counted and likely resulted in it not appearing anywhere on the chart. Piscatella did tell me that its physical sales ranked it among the top 35 best-sellers in April, No.22 on PlayStation, and it was 19th in monthly active users on Xbox and 21st on Steam. "It released towards the end of the month, and started a bit slow (player count rankings have improved each week since launch through May 10)," he said. "All of those bits reflect a very successful result for a game of its type.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a game that was been incredibly well received by the enthusiast audience, but by the end of the month had not crossed over to the mainstream in a significant way. We'll have to see what May ends up looking like (with more physical copies entering the market and word of mouth pushing the game to a bigger audience)."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, April consumer spending on video games was down 3% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, with content spending down 2%. Non-mobile subscription spending and console digital premium downloads were up, but all other content segments were down. And accessories spending was down 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware was also down 8%, reaching the lowest monthly hardware dollar sales total reached in the U.S. market since July 2020. The PS5 was once again the best-selling console in both unit and dollar sales despite dropping 5% from last year. The Switch dropped 37%, but the Xbox Series console actually grew its sales year-over-year by 8%.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">April 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered (NEW)</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>MLB: The Show 25</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>The Last of Us: Part 2</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li><li>The Elder Scrolls: Online</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Kingdom Come II: Deliverance</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

<p>Our Ed has already had some time with To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">spoke to its creator Keita Takahashi</a>. "The concept of the character being in a T-pose came from another small game idea I had," Takahashi told Ed. "I hadn't linked the T-pose to disability until someone pointed it out in feedback. I was more focused on daily life challenges, which could be categorised as disabilities, but the inspiration was primarily drawn from game design."</p>
<p>Metaphor ReFantazio is a particular highlight from this batch of incoming Game Pass games. We awarded it five stars on its release, with our Ed saying "what it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Eurogamer's Metaphor ReFantazio review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/is-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s-better-with-joy-con-2-mouse-controls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is…. one of the more confounding game releases for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. The mash-em-up puzzler where Puyo Puyo and Tetris combine and collide in a variety of different game modes broke onto the global scene with the first game’s release for Nintendo Switch (and PlayStation 4) in 2017, a localised port of the 2014 Japanese release. That was then followed a few years later with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/puyo-puyo-tetris-2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>, with a new story mode and Skill Battles.</p>
<p>Now that same game is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> with a sprinkling of added content for the new system. It’s essentially the same game with a new Tetris Doubles mode where two players share the same board with their own stream of blocks – something that we sadly didn’t try out while going hands on – and support for Joy-Con 2 mouse mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S –&nbsp;Mouse mode most puzzling" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RNJ5wHF4nvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s the mouse mode that everyone at Sega’s preview event really focussed on. It’s pretty simple, really. As a new block appears at the top of the grid for you to drop, you move the mouse and that block swipes from side to side while gradually dropping down to the pile of blocks you’ve previously placed. Click with the shoulder button to rotate the block, but then to drop the block down hard you pull the mouse towards you.</p>
<p>And that’s where I had my biggest issue. Time and again, pulling the mouse toward me also had me moving left or right just enough so that the block would also shift over a space or two, ruining my placement and plan – not always so disastrous in Puyo Puyo at my skill level, but always a pain in Tetris to adjust. It’s quite a strange input choice for such a key mechanic, when the PC versions of this series allow for mouse inputs, but use a key press for the hard drop instead of a gesture.</p>

<p>There is also a way to hard drop using the analogue stick, though this didn’t really sit under the thumb for me, so thankfully there’s also other control presets that you can switch between. These let you trigger that hard drop with a face button press or one of the shoulder triggers, which should be much more reliable. Why is that not the default? I don’t rightly know, but that does help with the biggest issues I had with mouse inputs.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m not entirely sure that it makes sense for me. There’s an argument to be had for rapid swipes, but these are games where the players have to make fast, if not instant decisions, and rely on precise digital inputs. Even for a frankly very run-of-the-mill kind of player like me, I imagine that I’d find that imprecision rather annoying in the long run.</p>
<p>Spending half an hour with Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S and checking out the new mouse mode, the first impressions are a bit underwhelming for what’s touted as an enhanced release.&nbsp;It’s fair to say that there’s some strong opinions about how this game is priced from this, as there’s no upgrade path from Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 to 2S.</p>

<p>At the very least, it’s no more expensive than other versions, and this game is still jam-packed with different ways to play and combine Puyo Puyo and Tetris, whether it’s the solo adventure mode, Skill Battles, a variety of multiplayer battle modes, or just playing a straight up game of either of these puzzle legend. If someone buying a Nintendo Switch 2 wants a Puyo Puyo Tetris game, this will likely be the one to get.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-train-2-review-to-hell-and-back.1195119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-train-2-review-to-hell-and-back<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Standing out as a roguelike deckbuilder is hard. New games in the genre seem to constantly be releasing on Steam. For every <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow">breakout hit like&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em></a>, some games just get left behind. If you're going to release a deckbuilder in the current landscape, you better be sure you have a way to stand out.&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>uses the autobattler foundation of its predecessor to iterate by doubling down on player freedom.</p>

<p>From the selection screen to the last track on the map, there are so many ways for you to build your perfect army to storm the gates of Heaven with. Though the forces you face and friends you find can become a little repetitive, the toolbox Shiny Shoe gives to you feels near infinite in the ways you can customize each run.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Charming Challenges</h2>



<p>The structure of <em>Monster Train 2 </em>stands on the shoulders, like most roguelike deckbuilders, stands on the shoulders of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. However, beyond the deckbuilding and energy aspects, this deckbuilder is very much its own thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fights take place on your train, which has three floors. You place units on each floor, trying to prevent monsters from climbing the floors of your train. If you can’t defeat them, they reach your train’s most valuable resource: the Pyre Heart. Your units can die without consequence, but when your Pyre Heart reaches zero health, you lose.</p>

<p>This gameplay is divided into different runs, each of which can take up to around an hour. These are eight battles, each with a track to choose from between battles. Tracks have different stops, including places to spend your gold, fireplaces to heal your Pyre Heart, and banners to recruit new units to your forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main increasing challenge that each run presents is the difficulty system of Covenants. As the Covenant level increases from 1-10, you gain new challenges, like reduced control over your deck and increased strength for your enemies.</p>

<p>If you want some more interesting challenges, though, you can head over to the Dimensional Challenge portal. These challenges will provide interesting and compelling modifiers and restrictions to change how you see the game. For instance, in one early challenge, everything you receive is doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds great at first: double gold will make upgrades so much easier! Then, you realize it means that you also need to take two copies of every card. It really makes you rethink which cards to take in a creative way. If you find mutators you enjoy more than others, you can choose to add them to your standard runs before starting them from the menu.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Expression Excellence</h2>



<p>Deckbuilders are at their best when they give you the tools to break them in creative ways. <em>Monster Train 2</em> delivers in spades, and a major reason why is the clan system. In addition to choosing a primary clan that grants a primary champion to follow, you choose a secondary clan, which can impact your starting deck cards and cards you find along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, combining the Lazarus League’s Reanimate abilities with the Banished’s Valor spells can help your units revive near death with 1 health point, but high armor to withstand continued attacks.</p>

<p>As you collect cards, your runs can become even more personalized with upgrades you collect. Instead of a linear upgrade system, <em>Monster Train 2</em> takes a more open approach to upgrades, letting you choose which aspects of a card you want to upgrade in each shop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you want to make a card that’s usually only single-use, able to be used multiple times in one combat? Reduce a card’s energy cost? Make a spell’s power more potent? The choice is yours, and you can go anywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part is that there isn’t a single “correct” answer. There may be ones you become more comfortable with, but the best answer will change depending on how your run is developing, and what you’re focusing on to do heavy damage or build up your defenses in your run.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - The Repetition Rut</h2>



<p>While you have loads of variety to express yourself, I wish the enemy forces you were fighting did the same. There are a couple of different possible permutations for each of the 8 encounters, but after a few runs, you'll see most of what there is to see as far as encounters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bosses are the same during each train ride through Heaven, with 3 in each run. There are a few different modifiers they have to freshen them up, but it definitely leaves runs feeling a little samey if you are playing as the same clans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Celestial Alcove events, which are small events that let you make choices to affect your deck, also seem to pull from a pretty small variety. I started mostly ignoring these because while some were neat, it felt like I'd seen them all pretty early. When I did see them, more often than not, I ignored them due to the harsh penalties that some imposed.</p>

<p>This will also become the case with given clans. With so many different card types like Spells, Equipment, and Units, and specialized shops for each, you'll almost certainly start seeing the same cards in your runs. However, this was a small snag that was easy to circumvent. When I started seeing a lot of the same cards, changing up the clan made it feel fresh again. Even when I started seeing the same cards, I could make different upgrade choices to make things feel fresh.</p>

<p>More unlocks for content started to unlock throughout the process of the main story. As you progress the story, which will happen naturally as you unlock the various clans and Pyre Hearts, other mechanics, both for your foes and you, will reveal themselves. It's a neat way to gate content and drip-feed new stuff as you progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the story itself is a little one-note and feels like it relies quite a bit on knowledge of the first&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>. It's easy to enjoy the game itself without the knowledge of the predecessor, but you might be scratching your head a bit during the dialogue exchanges without it.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">great deckbuilder</a> that fans of the genre should add to their collection. The resistance you face can start to feel a little repetitive as you start getting deeper into the game, and the story is more of a vehicle for unlocks than something that stands on its own. But the toolbox of deckbuilding creativity on the player side, from the synergies you can build in your deck to mutators you can add into your run, makes it feel like a game that anyone who takes the time can break in the best way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remastered Tops US Gaming Sales Chart for April]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-tops-us-gaming-sales-chart-for-april.1195116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for April in the US, and Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>has topped sales charts for the month, an impressive feat considering its availability on Game Pass.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>topped the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo44vmwk2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-format sales charts</a>&nbsp;for the month, and it also hit number one on both the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo4byukv2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo4dcbr52e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> charts individually. The game isn't available on the Switch, so that console's honor went to&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdropped last month</a> (although it had become a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">pretty poorly-kept secret</a> by the time it was released). Developed by Virtuos, the game retains the original title's gameplay and underlying engine, but gives it a fresh Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remastered-circana-april-spriggan.jpg?itok=FT8Ftecy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remastered-circana-april-spriggan.jpg?itok=5lkIrgE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well, despite the fact that it's on Game Pass.</figcaption></figure><p>In second place on the all-format charts is&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, no doubt bolstered by its PS5 release in April, with&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>in third, fourth, and fifth place respectively.</p>

<p>On a year-to-date basis (i.e. starting from January and running until May), the best-selling game of the year is still Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which shouldn't come as a surprise given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">phenomenal early sales performance</a>.</p>

<p>Second place goes to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, which will likely come as a reassurance to Ubisoft given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">grim financial state</a>, and the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>is the year's third best-selling game so far.</p>

<p>In the hardware stakes, the PS5 has once again emerged victorious in April on both unit and dollar sales. Switch hardware sales plummeted by 37% compared to last year, but that's arguably to be expected given that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">successor is just around the corner</a>.</p>

<p>The previously Xbox console-exclusive is celebrating its one year anniversary, so will now come to Sony's console with new features and haptic feedback implementation. Those new features will also be added in a free update to the Xbox and PC versions of the game.</p>
<p>"We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword," said studio head Dom Matthews in a video shared on social media. "And we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans back to Senua's story."</p>

<p>The first Hellblade, Senua's Sacrifice, was released in 2017 across PS4 and PC, followed by an Xbox One release in 2018 and Switch in 2019.</p>
<p>Ninja Theory was then acquired in 2018 by Microsoft, hence the sequel skipped Sony's console - until now.</p>

			<p>Ninja Theory has announced that Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will arrive on PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829"> video posted to the studio's official X account</a>, with studio head Dom Matthews delivering the good news. Matthews doesn't provide a specific release date, only saying that it will arrive sometime this summer, though he did reveal that there will be some new features added to the game with the PS5 release that will also be available on the Xbox and PC versions of the game the same day the PS5 version launches.</p>
<p>"<em>We're so happy to tell you, our fans, that Hellblade 2 will be coming to PlayStation 5 this summer,</em>" Matthews said. "<em>This version of the game will include some new features, which will also be coming to Xbox and PC at the same time as an update</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Comes to PlayStation 5 This Summer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ninja Theory might be an Xbox Game Studios developer now, but as Matthews points out in the video, the studio has a rich history with PlayStation. The first Hellblade game launched on PlayStation 4 before coming to Xbox a little less than a year later, and PlayStation veterans will remember that Ninja Theory was the team behind the PlayStation 3 launch title, Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p>"<em>We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation, going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword, and we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans, back to Senua's story,</em>" Matthews continued. "<em>And so the team have been working hard to optimize Hellblade 2 for both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro to give you the very best experience we can, and we look forward to sharing more details with you soon.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll launch on PlayStation under a slightly new title, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced, and is already available to wishlist on PS5 consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ninja Theory has announced that its narrative-led action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Ninja Theory celebrates the one-year anniversary of the game's release by freeing it of its Xbox exclusivity (on console, at least). We don't have a release date for the game yet; the studio simply says it's coming in "summer".</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 version, Ninja Theory also says that&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will be getting some extra features, and that these features will also be coming to the Xbox and PC versions of the game, presumably when the PS5 version launches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-running.jpg?itok=523wL_XT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-running.jpg?itok=KTrLfUKS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>The PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will also sport some PS5 Pro improvements, with Ninja Theory "working hard to optimize [the game] for both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro" in order to provide the "very best experience".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, it's the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>, and it picks up the story of the titular character as she travels to Iceland in order to save her people from slavery.</p>

<p>Like the first game, <i>Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>is a linear journey that marries action-adventure gameplay and combat, exploration, and psychological horror elements. The titular character, Senua, suffers from psychosis, a condition that manifests itself in the form of voices that both guide and hinder her.</p>




<p>Ninja Theory's game is just one of several Xbox titles to come to PS5 in the last year or two. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>, Obsidian adventures&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Pentiment</em></a>, and open-world racer&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>remaster&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>will bring the influential third-person shooter franchise to PlayStation for the first time when it launches later this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.

            <p>A Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay is officially in production.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">project was first floated last year</a>, when it was reported there had been talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise, with The Rock and Armageddon director attached. It left me scratching my head a bit, to be honest.</p>

<p>But fast forward to today, and those talks are now firmed up, with the news that yes, we are indeed going to be getting a Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay.</p>
<p>Media Company Invisible Narratives - of which Bay serves as a chief creative advisor - will be producing, developing, and financing the project. You can see an image of its Skibidi Toilet project on the <a href="https://www.invisiblenarratives.com/">company's website</a> (or you can look at the screenshot I took below).</p>
<p>Bay along with partner Jeffrey Beecroft have reportedly been working on their Skibidi Toilet project since last summer, with a <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/michael-bay-skibidi-toilet-film/">press release stating</a> it is "an early creative take on the franchise", which will bring "Bay's signature visual intensity to one of the internet's most unlikely breakout IPs".</p>

<p>Skibidi Toilet, for those still mercifully unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike. It features a race of evil toilets with human heads, and has clocked up a whopping 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in adaptation news, yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clash-of-clans-latest-video-game-to-get-the-netflix-animated-treatment">Netflix announced it was gearing up to release a Clash of Clans animated series</a>, which will feature a "determined but in-over-his-head Barbarian who must rally a band of misfits to defend their village and navigate the comically absurd politics of war".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>One of the biggest success stories of the past decade has been the breakout popularity of the Yakuza franchise. The success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> in the West spurred Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to redouble their efforts on more timely localised releases, and eventually to also bring the series to PC and Xbox alongside PlayStation. Up until now Nintendo has been left out of the party, but with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, they’re finally getting an invite.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza 0 Director's Cut –&nbsp;Red Light Raid in the Switch 2's exclusive multiplayer mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPQeyZg2fhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yakuza 0 is, as you can infer, a prequel. Set 17 years before the events of the original game –&nbsp;remade in Yakuza Kiwami – we get to see the origins of up-and-coming yakuza Kazuma Kiryu and his fledgeling rivalry with cabaret club manager Goro Majima in the tail end of the 1980s.</p>


<p>We got to play a chunk of the early story mode, starting in Chapter 3 just as Majima is on the search for a new headliner for his club, running around town, getting into scraps with both local thugs and an old man that’s insistent on training him in multiple styles of combat. Oh, and checking out the local arcades, of course.</p>
<p>RGG has sprinkled some new incidents and character backstories into the game to justify this Director’s Cut label, though we don’t really know how extensive they’ll be. What we did get to appreciate was the all-new English dub for the voiced cutscenes, which did a good job all round as a final localisation touch for this game – of course, the Japanese voice acting will remain a go-to for many, but English dubs make this game more accessible to a more casual audience.</p>


<p>Much more important is that the game looks and plays great on Nintendo Switch 2. This is an old game that honestly shouldn’t trouble the Switch 2 hardware, especially when docked, as we were capturing it, and it runs flawlessly from what we can see.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s the headroom here for RGG Studio to get a little bit silly, a bit whacky with their decade-old game, and chuck multiplayer into the mix.</p>
<p>The Red Light Raid mode is just about mad enough that it could actually be a brilliant little time sink. Teams of up to four players get to rampage through cramped close quarters combat against wave after wave of enemies. Each wave you face bounces you to another small arena in the streets, alleys and buildings of Kamarucho, and you’re fighting against the clock to defeat them all and make it to the next stage, building up to a boss fight.</p>

<p>It is rambunctious chaos, bordering on Musou levels of screen-filling action as you often find yourself battling against a dozen enemies or more within tight confines. Button mashing your way through is more than acceptable here, and you’re often pretty likely to at least hit someone most of the time. Some characters are more versatile than others, though. I unlocked and switched to the clown Red Lip Yamamoto and his slow, static sweeping scythe attacks make staying with the fast-pace of battle more of a challenge than sticking with Kiryu.</p>
<p>There’s some good twists here, such as how Kiryu and Majima have both been split out into their three separate fighting styles, meaning that they don’t have any advantages over the dozens of other unlockable characters. We’re in the meaningless money zone for unlocking those characters, with prices starting at ¥10 million, which you can easily earn from just a few successful wave clearances. You get the big bucks if you’re able to fully clear a mission, but the grind will probably start to set in as you upgrade characters to improve their stats.</p>

<p>Still, this could be a fun added diversion for people picking the game up on Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s great to see the Yakuza and Like a Dragon franchise start to make its way to Nintendo’s hybrid console. Yes, the games run great on Steam Deck and other PC handhelds, but those are still a very niche market when compared to the mass appeal of the Switch.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve played this game elsewhere already, there’s probably little incentive to pick this up again on Switch 2, but this is opening up a new audience for the franchise, and that’s always good to see.</p>

Patel wrote in a brief update. Patel's new role at Night School will again be as a game director, though what she's working on remains unannounced. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Night School is most famous for its Oxenfree series of games, the most recent being 2023's Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals. The Netflix-owned studio launched Black Mirror spin-off Thronglets earlier this year, around the same time it suffered an unknown number of layoffs. Months before, Netflix completely shut down another of its studios, working on a AAA game project headed up by Halo veteran Joseph Staten.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patel had been a veteran of Avowed developer Obsidian, and over 11 years worked in various senior positions on games such as Xbox sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds and the classic Pillars of Eternity series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Patel had taken on the reigns of directing Avowed after the game was rebooted early in its development. Avowed had initially been planned with a darker fantasy setting closer to The Elder Scrolls, with one big open world and multiplayer co-op. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Patel steered the game to launch as a brighter, more unique-looking experience, now featuring multiple large individual maps to explore, and an entirely single-player experience.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avowed - Xbox Developer Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to Avowed was mostly positive, and Patel had initially discussed plans for the franchise to continue — either with expansions, a fully-fledged sequel, or both. Now, however, Patel won't be part of that future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-update-14-patch-notes-include-arachnaphobia-mode-and-2025-post-launch-roadmap">Avowed development roadmap announced last week detailed an array of mostly minor additions coming for free over the coming six months</a>, including a Photo Mode and New Game Plus offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian's RPGs in the first place," reads <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">IGN's Avowed review</a>. "However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that's more familiar than evolutionary."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian's next project to launch is The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to be shown off in detail at this year's Xbox Games Showcase in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
