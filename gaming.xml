            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 release date, and the latest update for the popular gacha action RPG is launching later this month.</p>

<p>As revealed earlier today, you can expect&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 to arrive on March 26th. It'll bring with it lots of new stuff, including the final tribe of Natlan in the Collective of Plenty, as well as two new characters, a new map, and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can explore the new Great Volcano of Tollan map, which promises plenty of secrets if you dare to delve into its magma-filled depths. As you travel to the mountain, you'll meet the Collective of Plenty and take part in their "friendly competitions" of strength.</p>

First up is 5-star Electro Catalyst wielder Varesa, who uses plunging attacks to deal extra damage and give her access to a special Elemental Burst ability.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 is 4-star Electro Polearm wielder Iansan, who serves as a support character by buffing and healing her allies.</p>

<p>Varesa and Iansan will both debut in the first half of Version 5.5's cycle, with a rerun coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-introduces-new-five-star-anemo-character-xianyun" rel="nofollow">Xianyun</a> during that period as well. In the second half, reruns for Xilonen and Venti will be available.</p>

<p>Other activities include the return of the Bloomflower Trials, which will ask you to save an ill Saurian, as well as a new Treasure Seeker minigame that has you helping baby Saurians to "collect shiny treasures". D'awww.</p>

Finally, the mobile hit’s developers have promised a major overhaul of the busted system, though the fixes could still take a long time to roll out and will destroy a currency players already wasted a bunch of cards farming for. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Thank you for sharing your feedback on the trading feature in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket,” the team announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new blog post</a></span>. “We’re continuing to read your comments and investigate ways to improve the feature.” The biggest change is that trade tokens, a recently introduced currency required anytime you want to trade, will be removed and converted into Shinedust which will be required for trades instead. </p><p>Moments of economic upheaval like this have become common in free-to-play games, but some fans who already destroyed a bunch of their one-star cards to farm the currency for future trades now feel duped. “Appreciate the Trade Tokens being converted to Shinedust, but I definitely feel like an idiot for stocking up on Tokens now,” responded one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1900351172700959147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1900351172700959147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on X</a></span>. “I shredded a bunch of rare cards. Oh well…” Another was similarly disappointed. </p><p>“Oh people melting their 1* cards to get trade token while sitting on 100k shine dust and they lost nothing?” explained another. Not everyone is sympathetic. “If you traded a card in you didn’t have spares of, that’s on you man, idk what to tell you,” wrote a player debating the subject on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PTCG</em>P subreddit</a></span>. Players who have been hoarding shinedust since launch, on the other hand, are quite pleased with themselves right now. </p><p>A future update will also let players publicize cards they want to trade for, streamlining the current clumsy process of needing to coordinate trades offline or risk blindly offering up a card with no clue what someone might offer to trade in return. Sounds great! Unfortunately, the timeline for both changes is simply by the end of “autumn 2025.” Huh.</p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is also looking at changing the current restriction on trading cards rarer than one-star, perhaps the thing players have complained about most regarding the game’s trade system. Instead of being able to trade with a friend for the hardest-to-get card, many hardcore fans are limited to trading for cards they already have. </p><p>“We are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards,” the developers write. “Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future.” Given that trade tokens aren’t getting nuked for another six months as it is, I’m not holding out hope for two-star trading anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98we%E2%80%99re-cursed-man%E2%80%99-hecz-discusses-optic-texas-cdl-woes-following-0-15-record.1134615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new video uploaded by Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez, the President at OpTic Texas (amongst other things), the current ‘curse’ plaguing the Call of Duty League team was discussed at length. The 18-minute video offered a walkthrough of the offices that OpTic Texas plays out of, with HECZ talking to his team about the issues that have led to a 0-15 map record in recent weeks.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that <strong>something </strong>is wrong at OpTic Texas, as just a few months back, the team won the Call of Duty League Championship, the first COD world title for OpTic since 2017.</p>



<p>OpTic is trying anything at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-think-it-s-this-room">‘I Think It’s This Room’</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas’ Dashy and Kenny both suggested in the video that the room they compete out of ‘might be cursed’, with HECZ revealing that he ‘saged’ the room, revealing at the end of the video exactly what that meant. He’d even taken the time to stencil the ‘Green Wall’ mantra on a whiteboard in the room to inspire his players.</p>



<p>Shotzzy took a similar path, suggesting that they need to relocate to the old office that used to house the squad in Dallas, Texas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know what it is, bro – I know what it is. We need to go back to the Dallas office.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pred, who recently returned to the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/">after a hiatus</a> lasting a couple of months, agreed with Shotzzy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video from HECZ:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Enough is Enough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0uP630Tamw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>HECZ stuck tightly to the theory that this is a curse, suggesting that the organisation has to try ‘supernatural’ solutions to kick out the bad luck that surrounds the team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about this curse. Let’s talk about this curse, because it can’t be anything else. It can’t be skill, they’ve proven to be world champions, they’ve proven to push through adversity – what made this happen?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revisited comments he made previously, wherein he stated that the current roster is the worst Call of Duty team OpTic has ever had:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know that I jokingly and not jokingly said that this is the worst team we’ve ever had, but it is becoming more and more clear that, as talented as these guys are, there’s something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HECZ then walked around the office, demanding to know who had brought the curse upon the organisation. He then went off on a tanget about the talked-about ‘ring ceremony’ from COD Champs 2024, which is yet to take place. He stressed that ‘no matter how bad they’re doing’, the Green Wall and OpTic Texas <strong>deserve </strong>to see the ring ceremony.</p>



<p>What do you think is wrong at OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Seeking Investors For “New Entity”, Report Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-new-entity/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-%E2%80%9Cnew-entity%E2%80%9D-report-claims.1134612/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft is actively looking to bring more investors into the fold for what is described as a “new entity”. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published</a> on Friday, Bloomberg says that the company is “considering selling a minority stake in the venture and has contacted potential bidders.” These bidders include Tencent along with various funds located both in France and around the globe.</p>



<p>“Ubisoft has asked for preliminary bids to be made as soon as this month, the people added, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter,” Bloomberg says.</p>



<p>This new venture would include “some of its core” gaming franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Tencent refused to comment on the claims while Ubisoft pointed to recent earnings reports where it stated that it was exploring all possible options for the company.</p>



<p>The idea of a “new entity” isn’t completely new. Back in January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Ubisoft and Tencent had talks of a “new venture” that would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the company while giving Tencent more control over various assets. At the time, Insider Gaming sources said that there was no firm decision or direction reached with the company continuing to look at every option.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has continued to come under fire both outside and within the company. A minority shareholder has even called for a protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters after its claim that the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to disclose IP acquisition talks</a> with EA and Microsoft.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft looking for investors to create a new company entity in order to turn things around? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-refreshingly-brings-back-the-stealth-tactics-marriage.1134600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-refreshingly-brings-back-the-stealth-tactics-marriage<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic Commandos series was all about cleverly commanding a squad to pull off some daring operations aimed at crippling the Nazi war machine and putting a real stick in the eye of the empire. But it's also a series that's been in relative dormancy for some time, leaving other games like Shadow Tactics and Desperados to pick up the torch and offer a similar blend of real-time strategy and stealth gameplay that's all about pulling off some slick, decisive strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the upcoming Commandos: Origins from developer Claymore Game Studios, the series finally gets its long overdue successor following the 2006 FPS spin-off, marking a return to the original's old-school perspective and brutal difficulty. I recently got to play the opening missions of Commandos: Origins and came away appreciating this revival of an open-ended tactical stealth-action game – even if it took me some time to come to grips with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a return to the classic gameplay and storytelling of the early PC games in the series, Commandos: Origins appropriately focuses on the founding of the elite squad. As green beret Jack O'Hara, he's recruited by commando Sergeant Hancock with a mission to strike back against the growing Nazi empire. Following a daring escape through a North African allied base overrun by the Axis army, the duo soon expands their crew to engage in a larger campaign to destroy key targets across Europe and even the Arctic regions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Origins taps into the style of pulpy, ensemble action films in the vein of The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen for its campaign. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Commandos: Origins works has both a modern update to the classic formula of the series, but also as a jumping on point for those who've never played the originals. Much like the previous games, Origins taps into the style of pulpy, ensemble action films in the vein of The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen for its campaign. The core gameplay is a blend of real-time strategy and a carefully paced tactics game, where you command a small squad to sneak through bases, take out targets, and make it out alive. Instead of moving turns like other tactics games, your squad and all enemies on the field will move and react in real-time, which pushes you to make your moves count – or else face the onslaught of enemies on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to art director Thilo Gebhardt from Claymore Game Studios, he explained how the developer was specifically founded to help revive the Commandos series and how they approached modernizing it for Origins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The original owner of Kalypso Media, Simon Hellwig, who passed away, had the idea to bring back Commandos – he was a big fan of the original games," Gebhardt said. "He had the opportunity to acquire it, and once he decided to make the next game an in-house production, he founded Claymore Studios specifically to revisit the brand. [...] With other competitors in the genre recently they've shown that this type of game can still be updated to a more modern standard because it can be a hardcore experience. But we've also found ways to improve the interface and the pacing, and we hope to have made that experience more modern and less frustrating for new players."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With each mission giving you a list of objectives and a large map to explore, you're tasked with completing them efficiently and carefully. By taking advantage of blindspots in enemy line of sight and patrol patterns and using gadgets from the key members of each squad, you're given plenty of opportunities and a wide berth in how you clear a mission. In some ways, it felt like each stage was a puzzle box to solve – by way of a stealth-action tactics game, and I soon had to get comfortable with hiding guards after I had taken them out of commission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening mission in North Africa served as a solid tutorial in showcasing just how versatile but still specialized the squad members were. For instance, Sergeant Hancock takes on the role of the combat sapper, a combat engineer who can cut through wire barricades and plant powerful explosives to blow up targets. I found a lot to appreciate with how each squad member can coordinate, particularly with pulling off O'Hara's advanced traversal skills and quick stealth attacks to help clear the way for his allies to break the objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The stealth mechanics are impressive and really show a level of depth with the enemy AI and level design – particularly with how guards will remember which allies are in the area and how snowprints are visible in places that shouldn't be. While I mostly crawled through the stages to be on the safe side, I still appreciated the moments when I could get a solid jump on the enemy. One useful option is the command mode, which lets you plan out specific moves for multiple squad members to execute all at once. Following the opening mission, Commandos immediately put me to the test in the following mission, which chucked me into the deep end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, the difficulty here is super challenging. If just one commando dies, it's a loss. I ended up failing – a lot – and that meant reloading saves to try again. Much like early entries, Commandos: Origins sticks with a retro style of progression in each mission – and that means you'll need to embrace the retro concept of manually saving often – as auto-saves are not present in missions. In one instance during the second operation, I reached an important section of the stage but was quickly gunned down by patrolling troops. Because I was so focused on maneuvering my crew, I had forgotten to save and lost close to 10 minutes of progress.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the developers, the classic approach to manual saving was intentional, as it sticks close to the experience of the original games and doesn't seek to give players too many safety nets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought a lot about the fans of the original games, and for them, the aspect of how saving works was something you simply shouldn't change, it really comes down to taking away the liberty to decide on your own how you want to save your progress and what risk you want to take," the art director Gebhardt said. "Personally, I will save a lot, and there are some more daring and more experienced players who deliberately do not save. And they approach it like a little bit of a puzzle with a more creative way. So really for Commandos, it's about creative freedom of selecting your own safe points for."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These repeated mission attempts, in some cases, turned out to be a blessing...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My losses regularly felt crushing, especially considering just how lengthy missions can be. I often felt the need to take a break, but I still rallied and came through. These repeats, in some cases, turned out to be a blessing, as they allowed me to go through the trial-and-error process and pick up new strategies, sometimes allowing me to satisfyingly make the best of a clumsy situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one mission, I had to destroy a guarded comms tower. I originally took out all guards in the area and then destroyed the tower, but upon a redo of the area, I simply destroyed the tower and watched it crash down on two guards, with me walking away feeling like I was Agent 47 in Hitman. In one satisfying instance, I used my sniper commando to pull off a Saving Private Ryan-style series of quick sniper shots on alerted guards, giving my team some breathing room to rally.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The raw satisfaction that comes from tactics games is seeing a plan come together after taking a risk, and Commandos: Origins certainly offered up plenty of those moments – even after my crushing defeats. So far, Claymore Game Studios' revival of Commandos is offering a compelling case for its comeback, which can potentially put the series back on the map as an exciting and satisfying tactics game.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-have-slower-adoption-game-pass-to-reach-50-million-subs-in-2025-says-superdata-founder/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully unveiled soon, with the special Direct show scheduled for April 2 and subsequent public hands-on events taking place all over the world. The rumor is that it might launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as soon as this June</a>, which seems all the more likely after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that nearly 400K units were shipped to North America in the month of January alone.</p>
<p>Just how much of a success is the Nintendo Switch 2 going to be, though? Analysts aren't quite of the same mind in this regard. In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MTkwNjI1OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQyNTExMDU4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTU1ZXUTRUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.CFhPdHSiBuDEkV7N-hnAkpNngwdsityYMc9VRAYSIZU&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg article</a> published yesterday, Serkan Toto shared his bullish outlook:</p>
<p><em>They will sell boatloads of Nintendo Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price. We can expect a great software lineup in year one, from new Mario Kart and 3D Mario after eight years to Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4. There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>However, SuperData Research co-founder Joost van Dreunen has a different opinion on the subject. Van Dreunen, who sold SuperData Research to Nielsen in 2018 and is now the CEO of data intelligence firm <a href="https://www.aldora.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aldora</a> (while also teaching at the NYU Stern School of Business), wrote in the freshly <a href="https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-OL44iya9VPmIeTHhtHw/ALDORAs-SXSW-2025-State-of-Play-Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published </a>'The 2025 State of Play on Games, Tech, and Media' report:</p>
<p><em>No. The backward compatibility of the Nintendo Switch 2, combined with its relatively modest technical improvements, ensures a slower adoption curve, especially among cost-conscious consumers during the start of its new hardware cycle. It is expected to cost around $399 at launch.</em></p>
<p>In the report, van Dreunen shared a few more interesting opinions on the hottest games industry topics. As mentioned in this article's headline, the analyst believes Game Pass will reach 50 million subscribers this year as consumers become more careful with their spending on video games and look for cheaper alternatives like that offered by Microsoft. He also reckons an ad-based tier will be added soon.</p>
<p>Speaking about the rising game costs, van Dreunen doesn't think Rockstar and Take-Two will bump up the price of Grand Theft Auto VI to $100 as some have feared. However, he adds that there will be a myriad of incentives for the more expensive editions, which will cost up to $150-200. Additionally, van Dreunen expects GTA VI to&nbsp;generate a billion dollars in sales on launch day.</p>
<p>His last two predictions are less positive. The veteran analyst thinks that Ubisoft is about to be bought by private equity, which will trigger another wave of layoffs across the publisher's many studios. The industry as a whole will suffer more layoffs, especially among the bigger studios, as they keep cutting in-development titles that aren't projected to do well upon release.</p>

It remains to be seen how it'll all shake out. Bloomberg reported that Nintendo has already shifted some of its hardware production efforts to Vietnam, a country with no new tariffs right now. Nintendo will also produce Switch 2 units in China, where tariffs may be in effect when the Switch 2 launches. Units produced in China could be allocated for other regions outside of the US, but nothing is known or confirmed as of yet.</p><p>As for how well the Switch 2 could sell in its first year, analyst Hiroshi Yamashina of Macquarie Capital said the system could shift more than 20 million units.

			<p>The next entry in the Call of Duty series launching later this year could feature up to a total of six fully-fledged zombies maps throughout its lifecycle, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>A new report shared today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/">Insider Gaming</a> revealed that developer Treyarch's plan for zombies was to create maps from the ground up to allow them to be used in different play modes, like traditional round-based modes, grief, and outbreak. As for the settings, Treyarch has been experimenting with some extreme scenarios, including a post-World War II New York map devastated by a nuclear attack, a map set in a Japanese temple located at the foot of a volcano, a space station map, and others. It is unclear if all of these maps will make the cut, but according to today's report, some of them are expected to be released for the final game.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Call of Duty series has yet to be officially revealed, but leaks have already revealed that the game codenamed Saturn will be a semi-futuristic sequel to Black Ops 2, which will also feature remastered maps from the classic entry in the series. The game's development is reportedly being led by Treyarch Games, which released the solid Black Ops 6 last year on PC and consoles.

			<p>Despite the deluge of other shopkeep simulators and crafting games, the Atelier series has something like a comforting warm blanket. It’s a long-running RPG series that tends to focus more on the day-to-day life of being an alchemist and creating goods for the common folk. While the series has shied away from the mundane as the series has gone on, the spirit of creativity and crafting remains at its core. After a three-game run with Ryza Stout, Gust has finally introduced the latest entry in the series with <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-ps5-preview-alchemy-finally-comes-to-xbox/">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Memories.png"></a></figure>

<p>As is the case with most of the subseries of Atelier, players don’t necessarily need to play any of the previous titles to fully comprehend the setting or core gameplay mechanics. That’s in part due to most Atelier trilogies mixing up the combat and crafting mechanics from one series to the next, and Atelier Yumia is no exception. The tough constraints of taking time to craft against an ever-dwindling calendar are long gone, and so much of Atelier’s focus this time around is on the adventure outside of the atelier rather than the mysteries within.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land centers around the titular Yumia Liessfeldt, an already somewhat established alchemist who’s been dabbling in the taboo arts that once sought the great kingdom of Aladiss ruin. In her role as the junior member of an exploratory group put together to explore abandoned ruins and learn the mysteries of what happened, she’s often stigmatized for her craft. There’s good reason for many of these expeditionary forces to be wary of her, as alchemy had led to a number of great catastrophes in their lifetime. Nevertheless, Yumia’s goal in all of this is to uncover the mysteries of just what happened to make alchemy such a feared topic and track down her missing mother in the process.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Journal.png"></a></figure>

<p>The open world of Atelier Yumia is filled with so many little landmarks and items to gather that you can barely walk ten feet without bumping into another point of interest. In my OCD nature, I found myself aiming to reach 100% of each of the continent’s four regions for both achievements and a sense of completion. From locked treasure chests to small shrines of power that need basic logic puzzles completed before they confer their skill points to Yumia, there are often times too many little side diversions that keep the player from following along with Atelier Yumia’s storyline. In many ways, Gust shows its influence from the likes of Genshin Impact and tries to capture some of that Chinese title’s energy and design. When there’s no time limit to finish the story and bag space large enough to fit the materials of an entire house in your bag, there’s little reason not to just wander the open plains of Aladiss, beat up a Puni or two, and just spend the afternoon ticking off completion checkmarks for every little node that pops up on the map.</p>
<p>Something I didn’t realize until my thirtieth hour of playing Atelier Yumia is that the expeditionary force has a small checklist of activities they would like Yumia to take care of for them in each region as part of their Pioneering Effort. These range from using a specific item or character skill in combat to crafting specific pieces of furniture and the like. Initially, I thought these were just another way to gain experience and skill points, but I finally realized that completing this evergrowing checklist in each region, at least in the case of the first two, unlocks special ammo for Yumia’s gunstaff that can be used to break some of the barriers in her path. If you come across marbled walls that seem brittle to the touch or a spider’s web blocking access to a treasure chest, that’s how Yumia comes across these different ammo types.</p>
<p>One thing that I wish I had known sooner was that she has to return to the leader of the expeditionary force each time she crosses the 10% threshold on the completion list to cash in her current progress, earn a small reward, and unlock the next tier of objectives. Only by completing this list to 100% in a given region does Yumia unlock the special ammo or other tool to aid in her adventure. There isn’t a quest marker or anything obvious to guide the player, so it’s worth checking up on the expedition team once in a while if you feel like you’ve done enough to further the cause.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Greenhouse-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>Combat in the Atelier series has typically been a turn-based affair, or at least something more methodical. Atelier Yumia mixes up the formula by instead turning the entire focus of combat into an action affair. Yumia and her two party members can all act independently (with some AI strategies for the characters not actively being controlled) and attack the enemy all at once. Rather than being able to freely run around the battlefield, Yumia fights the enemy by circling around them in two set planes where she can fight from either short or long range with a single button press jumping between the two distances. Players can strafe around the enemy or block attacks, with perfectly timed defensive moves giving a powerful counterattack.</p>
<p>Yumia and her crew don’t have your standard attack and separate skill commands, but rather, all four of their attack commands are skills unique to that character and differ depending on if they’re approaching the enemy from short or long range. Each skill has a set number of uses before it needs to recharge over time, so players have to manage whether they want to burst all of their damage at once or play conservatively and keep a couple of skills on reserve for a precision counterattack. The items Yumia crafts operate in a similar fashion and are just a quick button press away to swap from skills to items. Yumia can carry four different attack items into combat, and much like other Atelier games, understanding the crafting system to make overpowered weapons is, while not required, sometimes the most enjoyable way to play as it makes combat little more than a formality. By the time I was set to venture off between the second and third biomes of Aladiss, I already had a wind boomerang and massive ice hammer that could hit for somewhere in the region of 5,000-12,000 damage, depending on the enemy’s weakness.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Nice-Levelup.png"></a></figure>

<p>Another strange oddity to Atelier Yumia’s combat that helped turn the combat into a breeze was the actual EXP rate. It wasn’t uncommon for me to go two, maybe three fights at a time between leveling up. My concerns of only having two or so combat skills available from my preview of Atelier Yumia last month were quickly resolved as I was already close to level 40 before even setting foot in the Atelier for the first time. It’s hard to say whether this was an intentional growth rate or merely the unintended side effect of testing out the various difficulty levels and the one EXP-boosting accessory I could craft early on. Regardless, I hit the level cap of 100 midway through the second biome of Aladiss and only had to worry about crafting stronger armor and combat items for the growth of my party. Grinding never felt like it was necessary with how quickly I was leveling up, although I did see myself hunting down a few specific enemy types over and over to gather up their raw materials for crafting.</p>
<p>The actual art of crafting items in your atelier is something that sets this alchemy RPG series apart from one another, even in terms of individual trilogies. Where Yumia draws her inspiration from are memories of items, remembering the base materials they’re made from and combining those raw goods with an elemental alchemy core to recreate the image in her mind rather than throwing it all together in a massive melting pot as is series tradition. This allows Yumia to craft simpler things on the go, from bandages and repair kits to the various ammo types for her gunstaff. More complex items, i.e., anything usable in battle, do require the use of an atelier or at least a mobile crafting station she can put down in any of the buildable campsites around Aladiss. There’s a strange minigame to crafting, where Yumia has to install the raw materials into her alchemy core and use the resonance area that each material has to capture stray mana particles and make the particular item stronger based on a number of arbitrary factors per recipe. If all of this sounds too complex, players can just push the touchpad when beginning a recipe and pick whether they want a high-quality item with stronger innate effects or the bare minimum made with the cheapest materials possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Combat.png"></a></figure>

<p>Building campsites and rest stations across Aladiss in also a simple automatically guided affair if you want it to be. Sure, you can build yourself the crafting stations and meticulously craft your ideal atelier on the go and build everything from the walls to the individual chairs yourself, or there are prefab recipe guides where you can just throw your extra wood and metal resources in at once and come out with a perfectly functional two-story abode. It’s a nice touch for those who like to fully immerse themselves in the RPG and show off their own style, but in a single-player JRPG with no way to share your creations outside of posting screenshots on social media, may be a bit much for the average gamer.</p>

<p>Calling Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land a guided JRPG experience is probably the best way to recommend this title to others. Everything bar the combat has been streamlined and simplified to make this entry the most approachable one to date for newcomers. Series veterans might not find much of a challenge to this mystery, but Gust has put together a solid first experience to bring the long-running alchemy RPG series to Xbox.</p>

            <p>Fans of damp tunnels and chatty skeletons may have enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lunacid">Lunacid</a>, a first-person dungeon crawler which left early access in October 2023. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">called it</a> “lo-fi first-person dungeon skulking done right” and suggested that it “could well earn a place in some best of the year lists”. (It didn’t appear on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2023">ours</a>, but in fairness, that was the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devoured everybody’s brain.) </p>
<p>Lunacid takes copious inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> developer FromSoftware’s old Shadow Tower and King’s Field games for PS1. Now, creators KIRA LLC are going even further with Lunacid: Tears Of The Moon - a new RPG made using FromSoftware’s ancient Sword Of Moonlight: King’s Field game creation tools from 2000, which came with hundreds of map parts, objects and characters plus scripting features and the ability to insert AVI movies and even a credits reel.</p><!--more-->
<p><a href="https://en.swordofmoonlight.org/wiki/Sword_of_Moonlight">Officially released only in Japan</a>, Sword Of Moonlight granted buyers unlimited use of the King's Field intellectual property, including the right to release and sell their own games. While hardly the Unity Engine of its day, it fostered a quietly thriving fangame scene with projects such as <a href="https://kings-field.neocities.org/som/dom/info">Diadem Of Maunstraut</a> finding an audience overseas.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t jive with elderly fangames, Lunacid - Tears of the Moon has charm. Like many a FromSoftwork, it takes place in a fallen kingdom and sees you journeying underground to soothe/defeat a restless cosmic being. Not being familiar with Sword Of Moonlight, I can’t say how much it tests the capabilities of FromSoftware’s 25-year-old toolset, but I enjoy the lurid smog of the dungeons and the lumbering choreography of the first-person combat.</p>
<p>Tears Of The Moon will release on 12th April 2025 - here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3506110/Lunacid__Tears_of_the_Moon/">Steam page</a>. While reading up on Sword Of Moonlight, I also stumbled on <a href="https://swordofmoonlight.itch.io/k">this King’s Field 2 preservation project</a>, which makes use of the same tools. It seems like a noble enterprise, though sadly the creator has run into difficulties following a schizophrenia diagnosis. If you’re checking out Tears Of The Moon, maybe show this some love, too.</p>
<p>Thanks to SeekerX for spotting this one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Varesa and Iansan join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [122 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Day of the Flame’s Return,” will launch on March 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-950103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Venturing into the southwestern reaches of Natlan, players will meet a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty, and explore the Great Volcano of Tollan, where they may begin their journey towards the sacred city. Meanwhile, Varesa, a new ally, and the long-awaited Iansan will become playable alongside a new Saurian companion, the Tatankasaurus, all to collectively enrich combat and exploration!</p><p>Long revered as a sacred mountain, the Great Volcano of Tollan now extends its fiery embrace to all players who dare to tread its depths— where traces of its rich, layered history lie hidden, where a sacred city built by the Dragonborn slumbers, slowly roused by the restless roiling of magma beneath. Players can enter the Sacred City of Tollan through a special method, and set out to unravel the mystery of the “Flamelord’s Blessing” and the enigma surrounding their Little One.</p><p>On the path to the sacred mountain, players will encounter a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty. The people there are deeply devoted to fitness and love to test their strength in friendly competitions. Nurtured by fertile volcanic soil, the tribe’s harvest is blessed with exceptionally sweet and juicy fruits. However, the volcano, though usually simmering in silence, can occasionally spring to life and spew out showers of falling rocks. When this happens, players can transform into the Tatankasaurus, a new Saurian from the Collective of Plenty, capable of smashing through large chunks of Pulverite and even briefly dashing across water or liquid Phlogiston.</p><p>New Saurians roam this scorching land, as do the Collective of Plenty’s noble warriors. Among them are Varesa and Iansan, who can sprint and perform flying leaps as they traverse Natlan’s terrain.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_950104"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Varesa is a 5-star Electro Catalyst user who uses Plunging Attacks to trigger her Fiery Passion state. While in this state, she deals more Electro DMG, and can access a special Elemental Burst with reduced Energy cost. To quickly enter this state, Varesa can tap her Elemental Skill, then follow up with Normal Attacks to perform swift Plunging Attacks. Additionally, her unique talent helps restore Phlogiston after the party consumes food. As her Tribal Chronicle will reveal, Varesa is only fierce in battle, and leads a daily life almost far too laid-back.</p><p>Known as Varesa’s coach and one of the six heroes of Natlan, Iansan is a 4-star Electro Polearm wielder. She provides powerful support to the party by enhancing the on-field character’s ATK while also healing her allies. Her Elemental Burst increases the on-field character’s ATK even when she is off-field, and her ATK buff scales with the distance that her teammates move. Additionally, when her teammates trigger a Nightsoul Burst, Iansan obtains the Warming Up effect, allowing her to continuously restore HP to the on-field character for a short duration. In the first phase of Version 5.5’s Event Wishes, Varesa and Iansan will debut alongside Xianyun’s rerun, followed by reruns for Xilonen and Venti.</p><p>After a long hiatus, Natlan’s traditional Bloomflower Trials will be making a return. Players will team up with Mavuika, Ifa, and their other Natlan allies to participate in this unique event, and save a brave Saurian afflicted by a rare illness. Moreover, in the “Saurian Treasure Seeker” mini-game, players can also assist a group of baby Saurians in their quest to overcome obstacles and collect shiny treasures.

The player takes on the role of an adventurer tasked with saving a town plagued by a curse, while exploring dungeons filled with hidden treasures. However, within the dungeons, curses can suddenly befall the player due to enemy attacks, treasure chest traps, or certain locations. Curses are not just a disadvantage—if brought back to town and purified, they can be used to strengthen the player. Players will need to decide how long they can endure the curse as they press forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The gameplay system follows the traditional command battle RPG format, with turn-based battles that split the party into a vanguard and rearguard. The player’s party will consist of a variety of classes, with the following five revealed so far: Fighter, Barbarian, Archer, Paladin, and Sorcerer. Additional classes are expected to be revealed in the future.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Gobble</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">Side-Scrolling</a> Action</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Gobble</em> is a side-scrolling action game that originated from Nippon Ichi Software’s annual internal competition, the “Nippon Ichi Project Festival.” The game was conceived by an employee in their second year at Nippon Ichi Software, who is now serving as the project’s development manager. Past contests have resulted in the creation of titles like <em>htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary</em>, <em>Yomawari: Night Alone</em>, and <em>The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince</em>.</p><p>The game is set in a world that should have found peace after the defeat of the Demon King. The protagonist, a young boy, encounters a talking “sickle” during a sudden monster attack. The brash sickle and the boy, who is searching for his missing family, form a duo, and a quirky, dark adventure begins.</p><p>The key mechanic in the game is “predation.” By consuming defeated enemies, the sickle can steal their abilities.</p><p>The game stands out with its distinctive use of American comic-style events and cartoon-like animations. Players should also pay attention to the visuals featured throughout the game, during moments like attacking or defeating enemies, or when events occur.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_009.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Kyouran</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2026</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Kyouran_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Kyouran</em> is an action RPG developed by the main staff behind the <em><a title="Series > Disgaea [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series.

This is done by using the powers of a goat monster, which can eat and destroy the picture book world, and a girl who can alter the paper-made backgrounds within the book’s world.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_004.jpg"></a></figure></div><p>Watch the full archive of the Nippon Ichi Software UNTITLED// event below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Since it was first revealed, Rebellion's upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall</a> has often been compared to Bethesda's Fallout. While both games do share a few similarities--from post-apocalyptic themes to killer robots--Rebellion says the game is more than just Fallout with a British coat of paint.</p><p>"Once you play it for a bit, you're like, 'oh, this is its own thing for sure,'" art director Ryan Greene explained to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-atomfall-developers-knew-it-would-be-compared-to-fallout-as-soon-as-it-was-revealed-average-playthrough-around-25-hours" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "And one of our owners, Jason Kingsley, he's a big Fallout fan, so inevitably there was going to be some parallels in that any kind of survival in the apocalypse, immediately Fallout's going to come up as a thing. And those guys are great at what they do. And that's cool. The reality is, here's this very successful franchise and we're version 1.0. To be compared to those guys--thank you very much--yes, we appreciate it because that’s a skillful team that's making that stuff."</p><p>Another key differentiator in the game is its lack of a traditional main quest, as players will instead work their way through several interconnected stories that all eventually connect to the overarching mystery of the game. Greene added that Atomfall will even allow you to adopt a non-lethal approach to playing the game, and he's "fairly certain" that the game can be completed without needing to kill a single

detective game. Yes, the post-apocalyptic first-person shooter from the Sniper Elite studio feels more like Paradise Killer than Fallout. Rather than ping-ponging between objective markers around a map, Atomfall's story is structured around a series of clues that are organically picked up and tracked as you explore its world. Its quests are nonlinear and you're gently guided to points of interest," Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-is-a-detective-game-in-a-post-apocalyptic-england/1100-6529960/">Atomfall preview</a>. "From there, it's on you to reference your quest log and put the story of its world together."</p><p>Atomfall will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on March 27, and it'll also be a day-one release through Game Pass.</p>

                <p>Konami is alerting players that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> features a range of potentially upsetting topics, including depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence. A <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/us/en/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">notice on the game's website</a> mentions this, along with Konami's statement about how the content in the game does not reflect the opinions of people involved with making the game. This all came about as part of the Silent Hill Transmission livestream <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/" data-ref-id="1100-6530124">where a new trailer also debuted.</a></p><p>"This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved," Konami said. "If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust."</p><p>Silent Hill f carries an M rating from the ESRB. The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40315/silent-hill-f/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESRB's ratings description</a> says the game's cutscenes show "gore and more

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> looks set to let you increase the stats of your Pokémon, fans say, after code snippets relating to the feature were spotted in a fresh datamine. 
</p>
<p>
References to systems for a "stat increase" as well as to a "Hyper Training Service" have been found by <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1900247443666854310">prolific Pokémon Go dataminers The Pokemod Group</a>, and suggest players will be able to boost a Pokémon's attack, defense or stamina.
</p>
<p>
Hyper Training is a feature from the main Pokémon games that allows you to max out a creature's stats - referred to as its IVs - using a currency known as Bottle Caps.
</p>
<p>
The system means you can turn a Pokémon with good stats into one with better or even perfect stats, making it more competitive in battles, including with other players.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go has never had a system like this before, though fans have long discussed how it might work. On the one hand, the ability to boost stats brings with it questions of balance, and concerns over how much a Bottle Cap might be sold for. 
</p>
<p>
On the other, there are plenty of players with 98% stat Pokémon who would love to turn them into perfect 100% Pokémon instead, and secure a "hundo".
</p>
<p>
In Pokémon Go, hardcore fans play and pay repeatedly for the chance to earn hundo stat Pokémon from raid battles, with hundreds of tries likely needed. Any item that could be used to shortcut this system would be a major shakeup, and likely be highly valued.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the suggestion this potentially-lucrative feature is coming to Pokémon Go now has led to discussion among fans that this is a design decision driven by changes to the ownership of the game.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">developer Niantic planned to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a>, as part of a $3.5bn deal.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Niantic for more.

		<p>It’s been another great week of gaming at TSA Towers, and for me, that’s meant more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. I’m taking my time rounding out my endgame loadout, as I don’t want to burn through literally everything before Title Update 1 drops with new enemies and quests. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, enjoying how different it is to my normal fantasy/sci-fi selections. I’m also hopping into Mecha Break, and Titan Quest II, while rounding out a retro-infused review of the Retroid Pocket 5.</p>

<p>First up, as is tradition, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Similarly, <strong>Aran</strong> has been in <em>his</em> gaming happy place by playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt again. He tolds us, “I’ve got the DLC left to do and the final parts of the main quest. All treasure hunts have been completed, all base game contracts fulfilled, and side quests done. Unlike my first playthrough, I have not subjected myself to uncovering all the question marks.”</p>
<p>It’s not all been a Geralt love in though, as he continues, “I’ve also started a new Football Manager 2024 save and a random team picker has pointed me in the direction of FC Brea. They play in the 5th tier of Spanish football, have a 900 capacity stadium, and have no transfer budget. My challenge is to make them a titan unless I get fired. Doesn’t help the board want me to just avoid relegation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been glued to Mafia III this week and hopes to put a bow on it before the end of the month. He says, “As a sucker for third person cover-based shooters, it’s been a while since I’ve seen those mechanics in a modern AAA game and while Mafia III isn’t quite as fun or fluid as the GOAT, Uncharted 4, it’s got some seriously sharp writing and great set pieces.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been in the hospital this week – get well soon buddy! – which he pegs as, “playing real-life Theme Hospital”. He’s hoping to be well enough for some relaxing gaming, which will probably be Nintendo-flavoured.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing some Assassin’s Creed Shadows as part of our upcoming coverage, as well as Phasmophobia and Balatro.This has been mirrored by Ade who’s game-time has been pretty much non-stop 24-7 all encompassing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows to be review ready for next week. Are you excited?</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> is on his travels in Kanazawa, playing the game of parenting on holiday. He says, “I did see an awesome, original PS1 box in the lobby of this hotel when I checked in last night. Was very impressed. Will take a pic on the way out the door today so everyone can partake in the natsukashii!”</p>
<p>And rounding out the week,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has just got code for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/expelled-is-a-murderous-sequel-to-overboard-coming-out-in-march/">Expelled!</a> the boarding school sequel to Overboard! and he’s looking forward to checking it out over the weekend. Aside from that, he got an early look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">its new 6v6 game mode</a>, and took a trip to see Steel Hunters, the upcoming mech multiplayer game from Wargaming.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-yumia-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atelier-yumia-review-open-world-woes.1134510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-yumia-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Atelier</em> franchise has changed quite a bit over the last few decades. Starting as short, slice-of-life stories, modern entries now feature lengthier adventures and more open worlds. <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3637a1d4-7598-4900-8ea2-69bcc2be9585" href="https://techraptor.net/games/atelier-yumia-alchemist-of-memories-envisioned-land" rel="nofollow">Atelier Yumia</a> </em>brings these changes to their natural conclusion, featuring the largest areas seen in the series so far while also simplifying many of the mechanics to make them more appealing to a new audience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while not being particularly terrible, this leads to a final product that fails to excel in any area. <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> loses the little depth that was left in the <em>Atelier Ryza</em> trilogy, all for a stale open world and underbaked narrative.</p>



<h2>A World Where Alchemy is Taboo</h2>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia</em> sees the titular alchemist traveling across various regions of Aladiss, a place once home to a great empire before it fell to ruin. Joining the Aladiss Research Team, she makes use of alchemy — something considered taboo due to its perceived dangers — to pioneer this long-unexplored continent.</p>

<p>Alchemy’s role in the <em>Atelier</em> series is one that’s always changed, so having it be something that’s considered “evil” in <em>Atelier Yumia</em> doesn’t feel too out of place. There was definitely some potential for conflict with the main cast and the people that Yumia encounters during her journey across Aladiss.</p>

<p>In practice, this doesn’t actually lead to much. A few party members are slightly wary early on, with the negative history of alchemy having its moments during the story. And yet, there’s not really any depth to the conversation around alchemy at any point. Yumia ruminates over it multiple times, but it all boils to down to “what if alchemy is good… AND bad.”</p>

<p>Yumia herself is fine as a character. Even if the general discussion around whether alchemy is really evil isn’t handled in an interesting way, Yumia’s journey to find her place in the research team is often endearing. Other characters aren’t quite as lucky.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-characters.jpg?itok=yOHLw9Mw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-characters.jpg?itok=LziBlu_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Facial expressions have been much improved in <em>Atelier Yumia</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, <em>Atelier Yumia</em> fails to give characters interesting moments outside of the main narrative. There are only a small handful of events per party member, with most offering very little in the way of characterization or just rehashing what we already know about them thanks to the story.</p>

<p>Things are worse when you look outside of the main party. Other than the 6 core party members, there are surprisingly few characters that actually have any importance. This is especially true of the villains, who barely make an appearance for most of the game and have the depth of a puddle.</p>

<h2>The Open World Still Lacks Purpose</h2>

<p>In many ways, the Aladiss continent itself is intended to be the main star of the show. For the first time in the series, <em>Atelier Yumia</em> contains a fully connected map with no loading screens — well, it’s more like 4 distinct regions connected by short corridors, but the point still stands.</p>

<p>You’re free to explore each region as you reach them, roaming around for materials, chests, and collectibles. Outside of some areas requiring specific items and later regions being locked behind story, you have a lot of freedom in where to go.</p>



<p>After being left to my own devices, it was initially exciting having a less linear experience to look forward too. The <em>Atelier</em> franchise has attempted open worlds in their own ways a few times, but even <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e767a144-72f1-42ad-b6f0-926fbc24ca13" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-ryza-3-alchemist-of-end-secret-key-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Ryza 3</em></a> didn’t make use of areas this large.</p>

<p>However, it didn’t take long for me to realise that there just isn’t that much to actually discover in each area. Sure, opening the map shows lots of “?” markers, but the world itself is devoid of actual unique landmarks or secrets.</p>

<p>Across a region, you’ll find the same sets of materials, the same enemies (or slightly resized/recolored ones), and chests with mostly useless items. You’re never rewarded for going off the beaten path, as all you’ll find are materials you have an abundance of already.</p>

<p>Adding to this repetition are the Prayer Shrines scattered across each region. Every single one works the same way: interact with them, go to the points marked on the map, and complete basic tile puzzles. I was already bored of doing these after the first few times, and there are over 50 in total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-prayer-shrines.jpg?itok=GbuF05zD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-prayer-shrines.jpg?itok=wmBkjlzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Puzzle design never gets much more complicated than moving a block to the panel right next to it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the world just feels like a checklist, something to fill in and move on rather than properly engage with. Some decent sidequests could have given purpose to more of the map, but most just require you to hand over materials or create a specific item.</p>

<p>Moving to a proper open world also comes with the question of how you’ll balance combat, since players could potentially encounter tough enemies early on if they’re not careful. <em>Atelier Yumia</em> tackles this by removing the challenge from battles entirely.</p>

<h2>Atelier Yumia’s Combat is a Bland Mess</h2>

<p>The <em>Atelier Ryza</em> trilogy started to shift battles to a more actiony style, with <em>Atelier Yumia </em>switching things over to full real-time combat. You can actively dodge attacks, or move out of the way of AOE markers. You don’t have complete control however, with movement constrained to inner and outer rings you can switch between freely.</p>

<p>Each character has access to 4 skills while standing in each ring, which charge up over time. Some skills can be used repeatedly as a combo, while others require recharging after a single use. Items also function this way, though finite consumables have not been a thing in <em>Atelier</em> combat for a while now anyway.</p>



<p>Skill can have certain effects (Yumia can buff her attack or debuff the enemy), but in practice, all you really do is mash your basic combo and then use one of the other skills while it recharges. There’s no depth, no thought you have to put in. What you see in the first few hours is essentially what you’ll be doing during the endgame.</p>

<p>A few systems have been implemented in a vain attempt to give combat some sort of interesting hook. Using physical or magic attacks on an enemy enough times will stun them, letting you follow up with stronger item attacks. But this is never actually needed since your regular attacks are always more than enough to take on every enemy.</p>

<p>It’s annoying that, despite the switch to action combat, everything is more restrictive. You can’t switch targets — a lot of enemies are even grouped together with a single health bar — and you rarely have a reason to switch between characters.</p>

<h2>Alchemy Lost Its Depth</h2>

<p>Another part of why combat is so easy comes down to alchemy. Alchemy has always allowed players to become super powerful if they made use of its systems, synthesizing broken gear or items as soon as possible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-alchemy.jpg?itok=S59NyV1W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-alchemy.jpg?itok=zV8W0lVQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alchemy generally boils down to spamming the highest quality materials you have.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Atelier Yumia</em>’s issue is that alchemy has been simplified to a level where making overpowered gear requires very little effort. In the past, you’d have to think more about the types of materials used, taking traits from them and transferring them over to the finished product.</p>

<p>Now, most bonuses are determined by skills you select before synthesis, or via Trait Crystals you can equip after. Alchemy just boils down to throwing in your highest-quality items and making use of the building system to duplicate them for free (more on this in a minute).</p>

<p>By the second region, I was already making gear that easily destroyed anything I encountered — even the few bosses <em>Atelier Yumia</em> has went down in a minute. Again, this is not something completely new to <em>Atelier</em>. But the process of making gear has just been dumbed down completely, meaning that even tackling harder difficulties takes much less preparation.</p>

<h2>Building Had Potential But is Underutilized</h2>

<p>One bizarre aspect of <em>Atelier Yumia</em> is building. Some areas of the map are designated as areas where you can build structures. This system is surprisingly robust, letting you create multistory houses to fill with decorations and crafting stations. There are presets if you want to quickly create a base, and even the option to make random ones.</p>

<p>I call this bizarre because there’s essentially no reason to actually make a proper base. You get the same benefit from building a fully furnished base as you would from making a shack with 50 chairs stacked into each other. A strange choice, when a good chunk of chest rewards in the open world are more building items you’ll now likely never use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-building.jpg?itok=N3mg2MJ1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-building.jpg?itok=xszJi64o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might not like it, but this is what peak comfort looks like.</figcaption></figure><p>It has so much potential — imagine if you could build rooms for party members to unlock new events or create new towns for NPCs. Instead, you’re restricted to small squares of land that are spread far apart.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you’re better off using land for greenhouses or manufacturing plants. These let you duplicate raw materials and crafted items respectively, only taking time to do so. Greenhouses unlock incredibly early, reducing the need for gathering materials. It’s convenient, but it also doesn’t mesh with an open world that mostly just exists for gathering materials in the first place.</p>

<p>I can only hope that this is expanded upon in <em>Atelier Yumia 2</em> (or a potential spin-off), as freeform building really feels like it could be an interesting direction for the series to take.</p>

<h2>Some Visual Improvements, Though PC Port Might Have Issues</h2>

<p>Modern <em>Atelier</em> has never been at the forefront of graphic fidelity, though <em>Atelier Yumia</em> does try to improve in some aspects. For one, characters are far more expressive. Early 3D <em>Atelier</em> titles often had character models that could look lifeless, relying on great 2D character portraits to carry things instead.</p>

<p>For <em>Atelier Yumia</em>, it seems like a lot of work has been done to fix this. From subtle eye movements to cocky grins, the main cast are far more lively now. Granted, the actual models still have a few issues (namely, low-resolution textures at times), though it's a welcome improvement.</p>

<p>Environments, on the other hand, aren't a huge improvement, though some of this can likely be chalked up to the focus on bigger areas compared to previous games. Some areas suffer from poor draw distances and pop-in, too, though this isn't overly common.</p>

<p>One area that I'm not 100% sold on is performance. While I have confirmation that a day 1 patch is intended to fix this, I ran into a number of issues with performance. This was almost exclusively tied to travelling between regions or making use of fast travel, causing my framerate to drop significantly until reloading my save.</p>

<p>Outside of this, everything generally ran at a solid 120fps on an RTX 3060 TI, barring a couple of areas with heavier visual effects. Again, this is something that shouldn't be present at launch, though it's worth keeping in mind when looking back at other Atelier ports on PC pre-<em>Ryza 3</em>.</p>

<h2>Atelier Yumia Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia</em> has no elements that are inherently awful, but the changes it makes to the series don’t work overall. Future games need to rethink some of the simplifications to synthesis while also figuring out a way to make open worlds that are actually worth exploring.</p>

The new variant of Magnemite found in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion only inflicts 10 damage, but you can use any type of Energy to activate it. Truthfully, you’ll hardly ever use this attack, but it’s nice to have the option in case it’s all you have in the early game. The real hero here is the Magneton variant found in the base Genetic Apex set, all because of its ability <strong>Volt Charge</strong>. This attaches an Electric Energy to the magnet monster every turn (so long as you remember to use it). <strong>Magneton and Magnezone both only <em>need</em> one Electric Energy, so you can still use Dark-type Energy to build up their attacks</strong>.</p><p>In a perfect world, the Darkrai ex and Magneton strategy looks like this: lead with a wall like <strong>Druddigon </strong>or <strong>Kangaskhan</strong>, and keep Darkrai ex and Magnemite on your bench. Evolve Magnemite into Magneton, stall the game so Magneton can passively accrue Electric Energy, and keep attaching Dark Energy to Darkrai ex to chip away at your opponent’s health. Switch to Magnezone once you can (either after your wall is knocked out or by using the <strong>Leaf </strong>Trainer Card), and start laying the smack down with its 110 damage <strong>Thunder Blast </strong>attack. If Magnezone goes down, or it runs out of Electric Energy, bring in Darkrai ex to clean up the rest of the game. Because Darkrai ex is the only ex card in this deck, it’s best used after your opponent has already scored two other KOs, unless you know you can lock in a victory by bringing it in later.</p><p><strong>What makes Magnezone so deadly is that, even if you can’t stall, it’s <em>still</em> very powerful</strong>. For example, let’s say you start the game with a Magnemite, Magneton, <em>and </em>Magnezone. Evolve Magnemite into Magneton as soon as you can, and activate Volt Charge upon evolution. Then on your following turn, make sure to use Volt Charge again <em>before </em>evolving Magneton into Magnezone, and just like that, you have two Electric Energy that are good for two uses of Thunder Blast. Slap Dark Energy on it to meet the three Energy minimum requirement, and you can immediately begin to pick up easy KOs. Alternatively, if your opponent has a relatively weak monster on the front lines, you can keep Magneton in play and use <strong>Spinning Attack </strong>to pick up a KO without consuming valuable Electric Energy. It’s surprisingly versatile!</p><p>Getting doubles of each Pokémon to use in a deck is undoubtedly a pain (I’ve been working with a single Darkrai ex myself, and I consider even that lucky). But once you’ve assembled those pieces, all you need are a handful of trainer cards to complete your deck. <strong>Professor’s Research</strong>, <strong>Poké Ball</strong>, and <strong>Leaf </strong>are common staples in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, and you’ll want two of each of them. You only need one <strong>Cyrus</strong>, and a <strong>Giovanni</strong> can help you lock in KOs. From there you can slot in a <strong>Sabrina</strong>, <strong>Dawn</strong>, <strong>Giant Cape</strong>, or <strong>Rocky Helmet</strong> to round out your support. Just keep in mind that, as the competitive landscape evolves, other Trainer Cards may become more prevalent to counter new threats.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-recommend-id="image://b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-recommend-id="image://b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As strong as the above cards are, they are absolutely vulnerable to counterplay. <strong>Grass-type decks</strong> can shake off Darkrai ex’s perpetual chip damage thanks to cards like <strong>Erika </strong>and the passive healing of Shaymin’s <strong>Fragrant Flower Garden</strong> ability. <strong>Exeggutor ex</strong> is a standout, boosting a whopping 160 HP while also inflicting 40 or 80 damage per turn at the cost of just one Grass Energy. Since Darkrai ex and Weavile ex are both weak to grass, cards like <strong>Celebi ex</strong> can be especially threatening with average luck.</p><p><strong>Fighting-type decks </strong>also offer some attractive counterplay options, despite being relatively niche in the current competitive landscape. In fact, player JeremiahTheGreat caused a stir in the recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/678569cc1c64910a07ac1929/details&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/678569cc1c64910a07ac1929/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hooglandia &amp; Spragels Open Tournament</a></span> by building a deck around <strong>Aerodactyl ex </strong>and <strong>Lucario</strong>, which was the <em>only </em>non-Darkrai ex team to crack the top eight. Aside from those picks, <strong>Hitmonlee </strong>is practically tailor-made to counter stall strategies with <strong>Stretch Kick</strong>, which completely bypasses walls like Druddigon. Magnezone and Weezing are both weak to fighting attacks too.</p><p>Regardless of your deck’s type, <strong>Sabrina </strong>and <strong>Cyrus </strong>really help against Darkrai ex and Magnezone. Because these two Pokémon need to spend their first turns setting up, you can seriously put your opponent on the backfoot by causing disruptions in the early game. For instance, as long as you know you can get a hit on either of the two monsters by drawing them out with Sabrina, they’ll be vulnerable to your Cyrus card later to finish the job with a strong attack. Remember, while your opponent <em>wants </em>to start with a wall to hide their Darkrai ex behind, they won’t<em> always </em>start the game with the right cards. If you see an opening to hit Darkrai ex early, you can set up for a KO later that can seal the game for you. Your opponent is <em>specifically </em>counting on you to never claim those two points!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Soulslike genre is adding another meaty release to its catalog in 2025—The First Berserker Khazan. There’s a lot to love from intense boss fights to a strong protagonist. Let’s see if Xbox Game Pass has the chance to add The First Berserker Khazan to the subscription service.</p>



<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>—as are most Souls fans. It’s got a distinct and notable JRPG flair to its graphics, but FromSoftware—and contemporaries such as Stellar Blade and Black Myth Wukong—would be proud of its bullish combat. Each strike and movement is lit up perfectly by the dazzling and striking art style.</p>



<p>I think Khazan will go beyond being a “sleeper hit.” But if it can secure a partnership with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, The First Berserker Khazan is on the way to a violent victory.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play The First Berserker Khazan on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gritty and gory. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan is sadly not coming to Xbox Game Pass anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple: Not every title arrives on Xbox Game Pass (or PS Plus) on its first day. Whether it’s because the developer and publisher aren’t interested, or Microsoft isn’t, we do know Khazan is destined to be a solo release available across multiple platforms on March 27.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass hasn’t been mentioned in a single The First Berserker Khazan trailer. Another very telling sign is if you go to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan-standard-edition/9NH8P6S460LD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan’s Xbox Store Page</a>, you’ll see there’s no Game Pass label. It’s a standalone release not partnering up with any of the big brands for exclusivity.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will The First Berserker Khazan Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The success of The First Berserker Khazan likely determines a future Xbox Game Pass nod.</strong></p>



<p>This doesn’t mean unsuccessful games are omitted from Xbox Game Pass consideration. Struggling titles gain a bigger, much-needed audience thanks to Game Pass. However, Game Pass doesn’t have too many AAA Soulslikes currently, but it’s silly to think Microsoft doesn’t want some piece of a successful pie.</p>



<p>2023’s Lords of the Fallen is on there. Plus, the semi-Soulsy nature of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is available. So it is hit and miss if this ever happens. My advice is to <strong>take a shot on Khazan and see if it’s for you</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this page if The First Berserker Khazan does come to Microsoft’s service.</p>

<p>Am I overplaying the potential of The First Berserker Khazan? Or can it knock on the Game of the Year door come December?</p>

<p>Final Fantasy is on a par with the likes of Assassin's Creed and The Sims, having sold more than the Sonic the Hedgehog series and the Legend of Zelda series. However, it remains far behind the Mario franchise, Tetris, Call of Duty, Pokémon, GTA, Minecraft, and FIFA.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, the PS1 era was collectively the most successful for Final Fantasy. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> sold almost 15m copies, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> sold 12m copies, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> sold 8.9m copies. Elsewhere Final Fantasy 12 sold 11.3m, Final Fantasy 15 sold 10.3m, Final Fantasy 13 sold 9.6m, and Final Fantasy 10 sold almost 9m (thanks <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy#Sales_history">Video Game Sales Wiki</a>).</p>
<p>However, they all pale in comparison to Final Fantasy 14 at 24m sales. In 2021 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">MMORPG was the most profitable game in the series</a>, and in financial reports since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-revenue-kept-afloat-thanks-to-final-fantasy-14">often kept the company afloat</a> where other games have failed to meet expectations.</p> <div>

<p>More recently, while Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">both follow-up Rebirth and the next series entry Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a> according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Still, the 5m sales for the Pixel Remasters - revamped versions of the first six games in the series - is good news for the company, proving both nostalgia and interest in older games from series fans and newcomers.</p>
<p>And with Square Enix's multiplatform strategy, sales are expected to increase. Most recently, Rebirth was released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">even if the port has issues</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Pixel Remasters were added to Xbox last September</a> in addition to their previous release on Switch, PC, PlayStation, and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
