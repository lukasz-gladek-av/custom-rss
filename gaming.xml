		<p>Rebellion has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> will be hitting the release date target of 30th January 2025, coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC on that date.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyqDitom1QQ</p>


<p>As is tradition for this series, those who pre-order will get the bonus content of a Target Führer mission, where you’ll be able to go out and try to assassinate Hitler. They will also get more weapon skins and the Karabiner 98 rifle.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a Deluxe Edition of the game, which will include the Season Pass of DLC content that is set to follow later in the year. Pre-ordering the Deluxe Edition will also get players the M1911 pistol and two days early access.</p>


<p>Sniper Elite: Resistance sees Karl Fairburne’s long-time co-op partner Harry Hawker take the spotlight, this SOE agent going on a mission behind enemy lines to help the French Resistance.</p>
<p>You can expect this to build off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/25/sniper-elite-5-review/">Sniper Elite 5’s</a> well-rounded stealth action sniping experience, with large open levels that give plenty of options for how to take on the mission, optional kill list targets, multiple infiltration and extraction points, and some side missions to complete as well. These can come in the form of new Propaganda Missions, which can be found and triggered by spotting propaganda posters in levels, which then zip you off to a mini-mission where you play as a Resistance fighter.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">hands on with Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> at Gamescom this year, saying, “Sniper Elite has become a bit like stealth action comfort food over the past decade, having really settled into the sandbox levels and mission structure in the last few games. Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-weekly-update-welcomes-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-romancing-saga-2-and-more.1018212/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-weekly-update-welcomes-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-romancing-saga-2-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's GeForce NOW Thursday, which means another weekly update that adds several PC games to NVIDIA's leading cloud streaming platform. By far the most popular is Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launches tomorrow on all platforms. Its addition to GFN is not surprising at all, given that the beta <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-will-be-playable-on-geforce-now-via-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already playable through GeForce NOW</a>. As usual, some players might scoff at the mere thought of playing a competitive shooter with added latency from cloud streaming, but for those playing casually, it might not be much of an issue, especially if they are subscribed to the Ultimate tier, which ensures the lowest possible latency.</p>
<p>Today is also launch day for Square Enix's Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, which is supported by GeForce NOW. Granted, the game's system requirements are far from demanding: anyone who built a PC in the last ten years should be eligible. Still, GFN enables playing even on other devices, such as TVs and mobile. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-ps5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> very favorably (8.4/10) on Wccftech by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>While Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven features the same narrative and core gameplay under the hood, this 3D remake turns the influential JRPG into a brand new experience. For players who rightfully enjoyed Kawazu’s non-linear storytelling in prior SaGa titles, Revenge of the Seven is a must-play. Just make sure to dust off one of those old Super Famicom strategy guides if you plan to see all of the tourism and fiends that Avalon has to offer.</em></p>
<p>The full list of weekly GeForce NOW additions also includes the following titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worshippers of Cthulhu (New release on Steam, Oct. 21)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No More Room in Hell 2</a> 2 (New release on Steam, Oct. 22)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/windblown-qa-diving-into-the-next-roguelite-from-dead-cells-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windblown</a> (New release on Steam, Oct. 24)</li>
<li>DUCKSIDE (Steam)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/off-the-grid-is-now-available-in-free-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Off the Grid</a> (Epic Games Store)</li>
<li>Selaco (Steam)</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3-HD-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>GeForce NOW users can also claim a new reward for Elder Scrolls Online: the Stag-Heart Skull Sallet Hat. Also, as a reminder, you can still get <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-be-on-geforce-now-and-you-can-get-it-for-free-if-you-buy-6-months-of-ultimate-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard for free</a> if you purchase a six-month subscription to GFN Ultimate by October 30.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A major new&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>update has arrived, and this one's themed around some pretty big indie collaborations, but it's got plenty to offer in addition to those crossovers as well.</p>
<p>These crossovers won't be&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>'s first; the game has also notably crossed over with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week">kaiju franchise&nbsp;<em>Godzilla</em></a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, the free-to-play mobile RPG from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sony-publishing-deal"><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>creator Shift Up</a>.</p>
<p>First up, Californian singer-songwriter and YouTuber mxmtoon has been added to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>, and she'll be playing a "special concert" for Dave and his buddies. You'll also get the chance to dive alongside her and serve up a special dish for her.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-collaboration-update-mxmtoon.jpg?itok=_Vw_Fcpu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-collaboration-update-mxmtoon.jpg?itok=6bu-Mp_f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Singer-songwriter mxmtoon can now sing for you in&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Hugely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">successful indie poker roguelike</a>&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is up next in today's&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>crossover stakes. We first heard about this crossover <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">back in August 2024</a>, although we don't know if&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>will also be getting&nbsp;<em>Dave</em>-themed content.</p>
<p>It turns out the Sea People are just as prone to&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>addiction as everyone else, so you can now take on the Sea People in a game of&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>and "earn a special Charm as a reward".</p>
<p>The third major game crossing over with&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in today's update is&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>. You'll be able to meet the Fellow Alchemist and help him find his Magic Cauldron, and you can also buy new ingredients and recipes from the Mushroomer.</p>

<p>Even if you're not interested in any of these indie crossovers, there's plenty more to enjoy in this&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>update, including a new minigame, a new tracking feature for recipes and weapons, and more. You can take a look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1868140/view/4658501443526031231" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full changelog here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, as is its newest "Dave and Friends" collaboration update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/from-the-sonic-movies-to-amazons-like-a-dragon-drama-series-how-sega-is-bringing-its-games-to-the-screen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has found great success with its series of Sonic the Hedgehog movies – so much so that it has inspired the company to more actively pursue big- and small-screen adaptations of its treasure trove of game franchises. Next up is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-shares-first-look-at-kiryu-in-iconic-grey-suit">Like a Dragon: Yakuza, an Amazon Original series based on the first game in the beloved series</a>, which launches on October 24 – and Sega has plans to do even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Gamescom Asia, <a href="https://jp.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Japan</a> sat down with Justin Scarpone, Global Head of Transmedia at Sega, whose resume includes 17 years working with games and entertainment at Disney and who joined Sega in April 2024. From adaptations of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/segas-shinobi-is-getting-a-film-adaptation-from-the-director-of-extraction">Shinobi</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/golden-axe-animated-series-in-works-comedy-central">Golden Axe</a> to early forays into the theme park space, Scarpone gave us the lowdown on Sega’s plans to reach new audiences away from the game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Like a Dragon franchise is one of our core pillars,” Scarpone said when asked how the new series was conceived. “We released a live-action film years ago, but I think the new series came about originally through conversations between the Amazon Studios folks and our Like a Dragon studio, and it became a cross-Pacific project where you had talent in both the US and Japan working on the project. It’s obviously filmed in Japan, with Japanese talent, but leveraging some of the creativity that an overseas perspective brings. So it's a unique project for us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Streaming TV has been a great home for episodic dramas set in Japan, with Shogun breaking records in awards season and Tokyo Vice showing shocking sides of Japan’s (fictionalized) criminal underworld. Scarpone said the success of these shows has been encouraging as Amazon prepares to launch the new Like a Dragon series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like a Dragon is a very Japanese story, but it's also very universal,” he said. “And one of the differences between the previous live-action film and this new drama being shown on Prime Video is that in the years since the film came out, the Like a Dragon series has become very much a global franchise. We have an international team who are considering from day one how to make a compelling story set in Japan with universal themes that resonate in different cultures.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He says that the dev team at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have been supportive of the Prime Video show, which is partly based on the original game but will tell its own original story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“(Masayoshi) Yokoyama has been quite supportive of this series,” said Scarpone. “As a truly creative individual, he's seeing a very interesting interpretation of the IP he lives and breathes, and he's very happy with the quality and the output. I think he's excited to see somebody else's perspective on it.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have an international team who are considering from day one how to make a compelling story set in Japan with universal themes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Like a Dragon game series has a setting that balances heavy crime suspsense drama with more humorous themes tied to gameplay. The Amazon show seems to be leaning more toward the former, but when condensing a game with a storyline that is dozens of hours long into a TV show, it must be difficult to choose which elements to embrace and which ones to leave out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the format of a series where you have about five hours of storytelling, how can you tell a compelling, exciting, dramatic and concise story?” Scarpone pondered. “Some of the games in the series you could play for over 80 hours, which gives you a lot more flexibility to weave in other aspects of the characters than you have in a condensed, linear format. So I think the director, the actors and the screenwriters of the Amazon show needed to make a judgment call on how to tell the best story within the confines of that time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game series evolved over time, so if this Amazon series were to have a sequel, I think we could also experiment. The series hopefully will be a good starting point in that format, and maybe there'll be more in the future.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sega's Sonic renaissance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has had huge success with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-review">live-action outings for its mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. Since 2020, Paramount Pictures has released two hit movies and a TV spinoff, with a third movie landing in December and adding Keanu Reeves to its voice cast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seemingly come to think of this period of the last decade or so as the renaissance of Sonic,” Scarpone told us. “There were a lot of stops and starts to try to bring Sonic to the silver screen – it didn't happen overnight. But once we were locked in and working on the first film, that was really Sega’s entry point into transmedia, and thinking of Sonic as a franchise, and the way companies like Disney and Universal and Warner Brothers have always done it for decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're offering new stories and new ways to experience the characters in different media. And so with Sonic, the film really expanded what Sonic could be in the eyes of the fans – and probably a lot of people inside of Sega as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-combat-movie-inspiration?utm_source=twitter">in an interview with IGN in 2022</a>, Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto told us the success of the Sonic movies had inspired him and Sonic Team while making the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega also has multiple other screen adaptations of its games in the pipeline, including versions of series that have been dormant for decades. One is Shinobi, which has both a game and a live-action adaptation in the works. The film is being produced together with Universal, which made the smash-hit Super Mario Bros. Movie, and directed by Sam Hargrave. Scarpone confirmed to us it is still in the “early stage” of development.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As we reboot some of these franchises, it's important for us to really work on the story, to update it for younger generations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic series Golden Axe is also coming back, both as a game and as an animated series for Comedy Central. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-adaptation-from-john-wick-creator-acquired-by-lionsgate">A Streets of Rage movie</a> has also been announced, with a script by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of these adaptations of older Sega franchises, Scarpone said, “Our core pillars are franchises like Sonic, Like a Dragon, Persona and Angry Birds, but our so-called Legacy Initiative is really exciting because, while these stories have a foundation, we have a lot more new storytelling to work on, which is really cool. As we reboot some of these franchises, it's important for us to really work on the story, work on the lore, to update it for younger generations who weren't even alive when the Sega Genesis was around.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarpone also confirmed that Sega has multiple other screen adaptations in the early stages of development, but would not share which games these unannounced projects are based on just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it doesn’t stop at screen adaptations. In recent years, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-review">Nintendo has had great success with its theme parks at Univeral Studios</a>, while other games such as Monster Hunter and Resident Evil have been reimagined as excellent theme park attractions in Japan. Sega is an old hand in this business, with its Joypolis and other entertainment centres. Scarpone said Sega is keen to expand on this, offering the example of its upcoming collaboration with the Kai Tak Sports Park mall currently under construction in Hong Kong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Within that complex, we're going to have Sonic Stadium, which is a destination for families and children in particular, as a ticketed area where you can be immersed in the world of Green Hills and Sonic and friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What Nintendo has done with Universal Studios is the gold standard, and we have similar aspirations. Attractions are another format to tell our stories and delight our fans, and we really want to be in that space. We’re not launching our own standalone theme park, but we are looking into different partnerships.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor of IGN Japan.

            <p>The developer of Dress to Impress has removed a hotdog costume from its lineup of outfits, after some players used it to deliberately dress their characters up like a giant penis.</p>
<p>If you weren't already aware, Dress to Impress is a dress up fashion game hosted on Roblox, that has blown up in popularity since its launch a year ago. It is, generally, a fairly innocent way for players to pass the time, and somewhere they can partake in catwalk shows while wearing an array of fun fashion looks.</p>
<p>At least it was, until the hotdog costume was introduced recently as part of a Halloween range. Basically, when certain players got their hands on the hotdog costume, they changed up the colour palette and popped on a fleshy-hued hat to make it look like their character was wearing a particularly phallic ensemble.</p>

<p>The sudden rise of catwalking willies, of course, caught the attention of Dress to Impress's creators.</p>
<p>"We want to create a safe and friendly environment for our players and it was not intended to be used this way," the game's development manager wrote on 21st October. At this time, only the threat of removing the costume was mentioned.</p>

<p>"Just an update in case you haven't already seen. The hotdog costume will be temporarily removed from [Dress to Impress] due to inappropriate usage," the <a href="https://x.com/BeaPlaysRBLX/status/1848839932141240717">game's community manager wrote on social media platform X</a>. "We plan to bring it back later with limitations on how you can colour it/couple it with other items to reduce this."</p><p>While the team does what it needs to do to make sure no more willies make their catwalk debut further down the line, it has replaced the hotdog costume with a hopefully less suggestive cupcake outfit, which you can see below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-child-safety-controls-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will reportedly soon introduce new child safety controls aimed at stemming the tide of criticism aimed at Roblox Corporation over a perceived lack of protection for underage users on the platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/roblox-enacts-child-safety-changes-giving-parents-more-control?srnd=undefined" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Bloomberg report</a>&nbsp;(which cites an email from <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>to parents), these controls include limiting certain chat features for users under 13 without parental permission, as well as requiring children under 9 to get permission to access games with "moderate violence or crude humor", as Bloomberg says.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will supposedly be introducing a new kind of account that allows parents to monitor what their children do on&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, as well as who they're interacting with on the platform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-child-safety-controls-report-logo.jpg?itok=uuTaDJkU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-child-safety-controls-report-logo.jpg?itok=1gNs9uun 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>will soon introduce new parental controls, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement provided to Bloomberg by Roblox Corporation, the company said the changes were "part of&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>'s commitments to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users".</p>
<p>However, the spokesperson for Roblox Corporation didn't elaborate on the changes. It's likely we'll hear more from Roblox Corporation itself as we draw closer to the official reveal for the changes, which we're likely to see next month, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>These changes follow in the wake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-report-pedophile-hellscape-lying-investors">a damning report</a> released by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, in which the company refers to&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>as an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" in which some groups openly trade child pornography and solicit sexual favors.</p>
<p>The report also found that moderators have a "limited ability" to remove perpetrators and keep them away from&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, and that moderation for the platform is "largely outsourced to Asian call centers" at which moderators are paid "$12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying".</p>

<p>Whether or not these child safety controls do anything to improve things for&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen; we'll have to wait and see what happens when they're officially announced. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft Montpellier's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good And Evil 2</a> has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of "vapourware", while staunchly refusing to become "abandonware". Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the "triple-A" game with the longest development time. I'm sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What's less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Ah, we josh, Ubisoft, but only because we care. The original Beyond Good And Evil was a magnificent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open worlder</a> with a sense of mystery and whimsy that hasn't quite been seen since. It had a photography element and a talking pig uncle who was an absolute liability in bossfights. I will pounce on any scrap of halfway-positive BG&amp;E2 news I can find. For example, Beyond Good And Evil 2 has a new creative director, Fawzi Mesmar - Ubisoft's vice president of global creative and the former head of design at Battlefield developers DICE.
</p>
<p>
Mesmar's predecessor in the role was Emile Morel, a veteran Ubisoft designer and game director of Rayman Legends, who died suddenly in 2023 at the age of 40. Morel's sad passing is the latest in a long series of misfortunes for the project and its team. According to series creator and former game director Michel Ancel, Beyond Good And Evil 2's development has been on hold for significant chunks of the 16 years since it was announced. Ancel himself departed Ubisoft in September 2020,  amid allegations of mismanagement; Ubisoft staff claimed at the time that he hadn't been involved with Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 for a while.
</p>
<p>
Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 seemed most concrete back in 2017, when Ubisoft finally showed off some footage at E3. The header art above dates back to that time. It looked very weird for a triple-A blockbuster production, and also powerfully unfocussed - a mouthy hybrid of Outer Wilds and Roblox, featuring Cockney monkeys - which perhaps explains the enormous development time. Rather than exploring a single planetary map, as in the first, players would zip about simulated solar systems of part-procedurally generated worlds. There was also a "Space Monkey Program" that would have let players create their own art and music for the game.

<p>
It's unclear how BG&amp;E2 has evolved since then, but Mesmar has a lot of experience overseeing vast productions, so hopefully, he can yank the pieces together in Morel's stead. "Today I'm glad to share that I joined Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 as Creative Director. I have been working with those peeps for years now on this ambitious game and witnessed their talent firsthand," he wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/?originalSubdomain=se">Linkedin</a> this week. "I am standing on the shoulders of creative giants that have supported the team before me, and I look forward to continuing to craft a game that is truly unique for players to enjoy."
</p><p>
Ubisoft has some accompanying comment in which they note that "Mesmar previously collaborated with the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 team as VP of Editorial". In his capacity as a top Ubisoft honcho, he also contributed to development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-good-evil-anniversary-remaster-includes-a-new-mission-with-a-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">this year's Beyond Good &amp; Evil remaster</a>, which contained a few hints about the long-overdue sequel's story (it's actually a prequel).
</p>
<p>
As ever, all of this is scant grounds for optimism, after such a long wait. I'm genuinely staggered Ubisoft haven't cancelled the game yet. It's pretty eccentric by triple-A standards - far from a proven earner, like Assassin's Creed - and Ubisoft are currently undergoing a well-reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">financial slump</a>. Fingers crossed that they'll finally bring it home, and that it won't be another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skull-and-bones-review">Skull And Bones</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero%E2%80%99s-new-patch-nerfs-yajirobe.1018128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-new-patch-yajirobe-nerfs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A couple of days ago, the official Dragon Ball Games account on X (formerly Twitter) revealed that a patch for Sparking Zero should arrive around late October. Their latest post shows the patch is live; check out the changes below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned in the post, Sparking Zero’s new patch targets several issues, such as responsiveness, balancing and more. The first fix is towards controls becoming unresponsive during online matches when using Classic Controls. The following fix adjusts the difficulty settings for some Episode Battles missions when lower difficulty is selected. Moreover, Yajirobe’s stats have been adjusted, and operational stability has improved.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 The patch is now live! 🚨</p><p>Also, we are aware of some remaining issues and are investigating:<br>-Character rank reset to 0<br>-Connection errors &amp; online matching issues<br>-Corrupted save data<br>We apologize to all affected players and thank you for your patience.</p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1849377423542079847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The new Sparking Zero Patch will delete “the Replay Data” of players’ battles, including Custom Battles World Library replays. Furthermore, the developers acknowledged some additional issues that will be addressed in a later patch. These include character rank resetting to 0, connection errors, online match issues, and corrupted save data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of all the changes in Sparking Zero’s latest patch, nerfing Yajirobe is one of the major ones, as this character had become a <a href="https://x.com/dsimons_/status/1847268172912623913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">go-to pick</a> for a significant chunk of the community. It will be interesting to see if the character can retain his position in the player’s DP battle squads after the patch or if the players must find a new meta. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2025-remasters-switch-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Multiple third-party remasters could be hitting the Nintendo Switch in 2025 to compensate for the publisher's internal team's focus on the console's successors.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tvPH-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PH Brazil</a>, who proved to be somewhat reliable in the past, the Japanese publisher itself is planning to release a GameCube game and a Nintendo 3DS game remaster on the console in 2025. Also, Nintendo is reportedly courting third-party publishers to release remasters on the system to beef up its release lineup in 2025 to make sure that players not immediately upgrading to the Nintendo Switch 2 will still have new things to play. This, the leaker highlights, doesn't suggest in any way that the new console is further away than anticipated. Among the publishers that are being courted by Nintendo are Ubisoft, which could release remasters of Splinter Cell Blacklist, Rayman 3, the first two entries in the Driver series, EA and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p><iframe title="2025: The Year of Remasters on Nintendo Switch (English)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/llgNYTpRvOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how the Nintendo Switch release schedule for the first few months of 2025, releasing remasters seems like a good idea to keep the console alive before and shortly after the release of its successor, of which we currently know very little outside of the fact that it has been in the works for a long time. Leaks from the past few months suggest that the system will also support ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS in some capacity. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the actual system, which shouldn't look <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/">too different</a> from the current one, and what it is capable of doing.</p>

            <p>A freshly-discovered glitch in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> has been discovered, allowing players to skip a huge section of the game and head straight to its biggest twist.</p>
<p>I'm being purposefully vague here for spoiler reasons, but if you're at all familiar with the game you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Really, it's surprising that after 26 years players are still finding new ways to skip through the game.</p>

<p>So you've guessed right now I'm talking about Aerith. And this new glitch lets you at last keep her alive.</p>
<p>Well, sort of. Essentially you force her to watch her own death and battle against the mother of her murderer.</p>
<p>As shared by Final Fantasy speedrunner Luzbel on X/Twitter, the skip was discovered by AceZephyr and Kuma.</p>
<p>The glitch does not use any form of cheats. Instead, players can utilise a complex mechanic where the game stores information on the terrain whenever mounting and dismounting a chocobo on the world map. With this, it's possible to walk through the world from early in the game straight to the Forgotten Capital at the end of the first disc.</p>
<p>Of course, players will be pretty underleveled for this section of the game. But with Aerith in the party, it's possible to have her witness her own death and then join the subsequent battle against Jenova.</p>
<p>However, Luzbel notes the game will softlock during a cutscene if Aerith is in the party when she shouldn't be. Still, Aerith saviours can at last rejoice!</p>

<p>This year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> tackled the same section of the game as part of the trilogy remake project. While I won't spoil Aerith's fate here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">treatment of the moment proved controversial</a>.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase stated last month the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-betray-fans-of-the-original-says-series-producer">third part of the trilogy won't "betray the fans of the original"</a>.</p>
<p>"There are these things we feel we can only do now in the remake project that can bring a new happiness, a new sort of feeling of satisfaction to the players playing this game now 27 years later," he said. "What this will entail exactly is something we hope players will experience soon."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</h5><p><span>October 22nd, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Remedy Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>It has been a year since the release of the amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, and the long wait to see the infamous writer back in action has been well worth it, as the game is among the best survival horror games ever released, featuring the same amazing balance between humor and horror that makes Remedy Entertainment the development studio it is, and some truly epic sequences that will continue to resonate in video games history for a long time. For the game's first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/">Night Springs</a>, the Finnish studio went all in with the humor, taking characters and scenarios from the base game and twisting them to present entertaining self-contained stories that did not take themselves too seriously.</p>
<p>Those who wished to experience more of the atmosphere and horror elements of the base game had to wait for the second expansion, The Lake House, which also serves to bridge the gap for what will presumably be the next single-player game set in the Remedy Connected Universe, Control 2. Undoubtedly, the second and final Alan Wake 2 expansion fully delivers its promises, but it could have been so much more, as its very short length will not be enough for most players to upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which is currently the only way to get both expansions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.10.23-11.08.01.87-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House stars Kiran Estevez, one of the Federal Bureau of Control agents first mentioned in Control that appears in the base game. Leader of the Investigations Unit Beta, the agent was assigned to Bright Falls to investigate the paranormal phenomenons in Cauldron Lake, an investigation that culminates with the inspection of the Lake House, a clandestine research facility on the shores of Cauldron Lake used by the FBC to study the phenomenons happening in the area and their relation to the Dark Presence. Inside, Agent Estevez will get to understand what exactly was being researched in the facility, getting to know how Alan Wake's unique powers have influenced the lives of the two doctors leading the research, all the while trying to stay ahead of the monstruosities born out of the horrible research conducted in the facility.</p>
<p>The story of Alan Wake 2: The Lake House fits perfectly into the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe, further exploring the themes introduced so far and bringing some elements that will likely be developed in the future, including a not subtle-at-all <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> tease. The expansion's short length, barely over one hour and a half, actually plays in favor of the story, as it translates into an extremely tight pacing, which, paired with the tension ramping up from the moment agent Estevez enters the titular Lake House, makes the experience extremely engaging, especially for those heavily involved with the RCU.</p>
<p>The expansion's tightly paced story is compounded by the atmosphere. The Lake House brings out the best Remedy has offered so far in terms of location design, combining the best elements of Alan Wake 2 and Control to offer a very immersive experience with amazing visual and audio production that make players actually feel inside the haunting research facility.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.10.23-11.34.49.35-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Alan Wake 2: The Lake House's short length works in favor of the story, it doesn't do the same with gameplay. With only five floors to explore, featuring a few simple puzzles to complete, which mostly involve carrying batteries to turn the power on and deducing passwords from a few hints scattered around, and only a new enemy type, a frankly well-designed slim monstrosity coming out of the paintings scattered around the research facility, it definitely feels like the expansion ends way too soon. The final boss, at the very least, is very interesting from both a gameplay and a narrative point of view, and makes most players ask themselves who was the real monster hidden in the Lake House.</p>
<p>If Alan Wake 2: The Lake House was priced reasonably, it would have been a much better proposition, as it is a worthy continuation of the base game in terms of story, themes, and atmosphere. As the only way to get the expansion is by purchasing the Deluxe Edition, however, I don't think it offers quite enough to upgrade to the more expensive edition of the game for all but the most die-hard fans of the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>
<p><em>PC version tested. Deluxe Edition code provided by the publisher.</em></p>

<p>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> would need "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" in order to get an Xbox port of Arrowhead's shooter off the ground.</p>
<p>The bombastic experience launched in February for PC and PlayStation, where it quickly became beloved by swathes of players wanting to do their bit for liberty by squashing Terminids and, on occasion, each other.</p>
<p>It's a game about co-operation - and as Microsoft games land on PlayStation, this has lead to fans wondering whether Xbox players might eventually get a chance to join in with Helldivers 2 - even if the brand is owned by Sony.</p>

<p>The lack of an Xbox release is something that was recently highlighted again on the Helldivers 2 Discord, when one member posted (with an accompanying weepy emoji): "I just want reinforcements in the way of Xbox players. But that's never gonna happen."</p><p>To this, Arrowhead  community manager Twinbeard replied: "Who says it couldn't? It's not up to us but to Sony and Phil to duke out, but hypothetically speaking, if both partners think it would benefit them from a financial/brand standpoint, it could."</p>
<p>But, duke it out how? Well, earlier in the year, the community manager suggested a game of chess between the two platform holders.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, the fate of Helldivers 2's Xbox dreams remain on the PlayStation maker's shoulders. "If Sony believes it won't [benefit the company] though, it won't," Twinbeard closed.</p>
<p>In other news, Twinbeard has also confirmed Helldivers 2 will get that shiny new PS5 Pro Enhanced label. "There will be differences between the current PS5 and the Pro versions, but what those are is yet to be confirmed," the community lead wrote. </p>

            <p>
Blizzard has announced a livestream dedicated to all things Warcraft for the franchise's 30th anniversary next month. </p>
<p>
The <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct</a> will broadcast on Wednesday, 13th November at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern, or 10am Pacific for our friends over the pond) and include announcements relating to various Blizzard games. 
</p>
<p>
"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> fan, you've joined the chaos in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-arclight-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a>, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," Blizzard teased. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>
The livestream sounds like it'll host Blizzard's biggest set of announcements this year, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzcon-is-cancelled-again-after-last-years-first-in-person-event-since-2019">the company's infamous BlizzCon event currently sits on hiatus</a>.
</p>
<p>So, what do we expect? Well, it seems likely Blizzard will use the event to shed more light on Midnight, its next World of Warcraft expansion following the launch of The War Within this summer. </p>
<p>Midnight is designed to be the middle chapter in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcrafts-the-war-within-expansion-kickstarts-worldsoul-saga-next-year">trilogy of expansions that commemorate the veteran MMO's first 20 years, and propel it forward into the future</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to tune into the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, YouTube and TikTok, with as-yet unrevealed rewards for Blizzard fans simply for watching.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I spoke to Jason Schreier about his new book Play Nice, for a look <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-the-scenes-at-blizzard-jason-schreier-talks-misconduct-swingers-parties-and-what-press-got-wrong">behind the scenes at Blizzard and to hear more about the developer's misconduct scandal</a>, swingers parties and much more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> have released an update to the third-person shooter that reverts a lot of tough difficulty changes made in a previous patch. Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn't the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last week, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?snr=1_5_9_">patch 4.0</a> for the action game introduced a "lethal" difficulty mode alongside a new Operations map (the shooter's replayable co-op multiplayer jaunts). It also created a modifier that forced players to stay close to one another, or face swift annihilation. By universally increasing the number of spawning enemies to bump up the hardcore difficulty settings, they also made all lower difficulties tougher. The new difficulty setting was meant to be punishing, but even at the time Saber were unsure about the changes they were implementing.</p>
<p>"Overall these changes are going to make Operations mode harder, but it is difficult to measure by how much," they said in the previous patch notes. "We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change."</p>
<p>They were not wrong to be wary. Following the patch, some players were annoyed enough to leave the gamer equivalent of dog poo in a bag on a doorstep, with over 2700 stinky Steam reviews piling up within a week of the patch hitting the game (compared to approximately 340 negative reviews the week before the patch). The general feeling was that Operations had become more frustrating, even on easier difficulties. </p><p>Today, the devs have rejigged things. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4530150757095178287">the notes for Patch 4.1</a>, the developer sets out their reasoning for the previous changes and give details on the roll back. Mainly, that enemy spawn rate has been reduced.  But armour has also been increased in "ruthless" difficulty, damage has been increased for bolt guns, and AI soldier buds will now do a lot more damage to bosses. On top of all that, the "tight formation" modifier that made it hard for players to wander far from co-op pals for solo sniping, has been entirely removed. A significant bug that made your roll distance shorter has also been squashed.</p>
<p>"Your feedback made it clear that the game had become more intense and stressful on lower difficulties, and this was never our intention," said game director Dmitriy Grigorenko in a message to players. "As I’ve personally emphasised in interviews, Space Marine 2 is all about the power fantasy, and Patch 4.0 negatively impacted it for many of you. This is why we’re rolling back these changes.</p>
<p>"The key takeaway for me, personally, is that I forgot that once the game comes out, it's no longer a dev's game. It's yours first and foremost."</p>
<p>When I wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, my biggest gripe on normal difficulty wasn't the number of enemies per se (although it did sometimes get overwhelming). I just hated the Zoanthropes. These floating ranged attackers buff all other enemies around them and force you to fire into the sky ignoring the busy crowds at ground level. They are insect asshats. But would you believe it, even these are getting addressed in the latest patch.</p>
<p>"Fighting Zoanthropes is often reported as a source of frustration," said Grigorenko. "Alongside the changes to the AI Director, we’re taking away some of their shields’ effectiveness to alleviate some of that frustration."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director.1018059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft's long-awaited Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains in development, and now has a new creative director taking the project forward.
</p>
<p>
Despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">record-breaking marathon on-again, off-again development cycle</a> stretching back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bg-and-e-sequel-to-be-more-accessible">almost 20 years</a>, Ubisoft appears to be demonstrating its commitment to finally getting Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 done by appointing company veteran Fawzi Mesmar as the game's new creative lead. 
</p>
<p>
Mesmar has worked at Ubisoft for two decades - hey, that's nearly as long as Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development! - and previously served as the company's overall boss of creative development. He's a senior and experienced pair of hands, for a project that has gone through numerous iterations and various senior staffing changes over the years - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">departure of franchise creator Michel Ancel</a> in 2020 after accusations of toxic behaviour, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">the sad death in 2023 of Emile Morel</a>, the game's previous creative director.
</p>
<p>
"With more than 20 years as an award-winning game designer and creative director, Mesmar has been instrumental in the successful launch of over 20 video games," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer today. 
</p>
<p>
"Mesmar previously collaborated with the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 team as VP of Editorial. In his new role, he's focused on continuing to build upon the vision set forth by our late friend and colleague, Emile Morel."
</p>
<p>
It's been well over a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-ubisoft-insists">Ubisoft last told Eurogamer that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remained in development</a> despite various shake-ups at the publisher, and nothing has been seen of it since.
</p>
<p>
Still, the franchise has been kept alive by a polished 20th Anniversary re-release of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-originally-featured-in-beyond-good-evil-and-other-development-secrets">a wealth of behind-the-scenes content</a> plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">all-new story content that directly sets up Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> (which, narratively, acts a prequel).
</p><p>
Discussion of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has bubbled up again this week in the wake of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">Insider Gaming</a> report which stated some staff who previously worked on Prince of Persia: The Last Crown had since joined the project. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Ubisoft also confirmed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">tapped Michel Ancel to consult on its plans for the future of the Rayman franchise</a>.

            <p>Not content with just leaking details prior to the event, people are now streaming Nintendo's mysterious Switch Online playtest on the likes of YouTube and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced a mysterious playtest relating to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service</a> earlier this month. It kept further details under wraps, but noted places would be limited, and only up to 10,000 people would be accepted to participate. At this time, Nintendo asked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">successful applicants not to disclose details of the test publicly</a>.</p>

<p>But, what with people being people, they did. It began last week, when a number of participants shared screenshots from documentation sent to program participants on social media. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/details-of-nintendos-mysterious-switch-online-playtest-leak">images spoke of an almost MMO-sounding Minecraft-like game</a>, featuring blocky worlds.</p><p>And now, people are once again ignoring Nintendo's request that the playtest be kept under wraps, and are streaming the playtest. Users on reddit have linked to streams of the test, and confirmed once again that the game has Minecraft-style elements featuring building. "Minecraft + WoW + Nintendo Mii games but very barbones at the moment [because] it's just a test," is how one user described it.</p>
<p>"It looks to be part Minecraft-like, part shared social hub(?), with persistent worlds supporting a <em>lot</em> of players at once," another added. One said from what they watched, the "vibes" of the playtest are "immaculate".</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest kicked off earlier today, and is set to run for a little under two weeks, concluding on 6th November.</p>

<p>It is not just the playtest Nintendo is seeing its community bend the rules on, somewhat. There have also been reports of troublemakers at the Nintendo museum in Japan.</p>
<p>As noted by X user Genki, one recent visitor uploaded pictures of prototype consoles on social media, which were taken from an exhibit you are not allowed to take photos of. Meanwhile, another person reportedly tried to unplug controller cords to check for emulators during their visit to the museum. Sigh.</p>

		<p>New World: Aeternum is the biggest shake-up Amazon’s MMORPG has seen since it launched in 2021. Not only does it introduce new features and content, it also brings the game to consoles with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions now live, complete with cross-play servers, making this the best opportunity in a long time for new comers to jump in.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With New World: Aeternum, Amazon has set its sights firmly on a new audience, though there’s plenty for veterans to sink their teeth into, and a lure to bring lapsed players back to the game. Personally, I missed the boat back in 2021 – although I enjoyed playing the various alpha and beta tests for the game, I didn’t want an MMO in my life and it’s fair to say that the genre has an established track record for rough launch windows. Now, after spending a dozen or so hours with Aeternum, I understand why the game managed to maintain a small yet zealous fan base and why Amazon thought it deserved a second chance.</p>


<p>Set during the Age of Exploration, players find themselves aboard a ship headed for the New World and helmed by some less than savoury characters. The voyage doesn’t go entirely to plan, however. Upon approaching the uncharted realms of Aeternum, your ship and its crew are scattered by the mysterious Stormwall – not quite the welcome party you had anticipated.</p>


<p>Two of the biggest changes new players benefit from in New World: Aeternum are the introduction of Archetypes, as well as a more dynamic approach to story-telling, via cutscenes and character dialogue. Eschewing the normal MMO class system, characters in New World are defined by their choice of weapon – these determine the active and passive abilities available to you while influencing the core stats you focus on upgrading each time you level up. While you are free to experiment later on, Archetypes present a handful of weapon combos with a distinct playstyle and theme. For instance the Mystic dabbles with strange arcana, wielding the Life Staff and Void Gauntlet, and being the closest to a healer/support class. Meanwhile, the Musketeer is a nimble, flashy DPS fighter who favours the musket and rapier.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, story-telling is another big focus, New World’s tutorial feeling more like the intro to an open-world action RPG rather than an MMO. The cutscenes – a mix of pre-rendered, in-game, and animations – do a great job of setting the tone and establishing key characters and concepts straight off-the-bat. Within those first minutes you’re already duelling upon the deck of a burning ship, traversing overgrown ruins, and peeling back the first layer of Aeternum’s rich lore.</p>
<p>Instead of arriving on the shores of the Americas as we know them, New World asks what would happen if explorers were transported to a continent wreathed in magic and mystery. Its stories steer into fantasy territory rather than being a retelling of our own colonial history, weaving together myths and muskets.</p>

<p>Being an action RPG makes the gameplay a lot more palpable on console. Even if something like Final Fantasy XIV works remarkably well on PlayStation, New World’s combat system is a more natural fit with light, heavy, and ranged attacks as well as blocks, dodges, and a camera lock on akin to Dark Souls and Elden Ring. Each weapon has six unlockable active abilities, allowing you to equip a maximum of three at one time with the power to switch between your primary and secondary weapon in an instant. It doesn’t sound like much, especially compared to classic MMOs such as World of Warcraft that plaster every free pixel of the user interface with icons for countless class abilities. While some genre diehards will feel restricted, this paring back feels refreshingly accessible, especially if you’re looking to master more than just your two starter weapons. Additional loadout customisation comes via a catalogue of passive abilities as well as your gear stats and bonuses.</p>
<p>As someone who gravitates towards healer and support archetypes, there’s always the worry that the solo levelling experience in MMOs will suffer. However, almost 30 levels into New World (with the cap being 65) I’ve not had to respawn once with only a couple of nail-biting encounters. This, I hope, is something that will change as I progress further and start dipping my toes in group PvE content, though it’s largely a result of me being slightly over-leveled for my current zone and making sure my gear is as good as it can be.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, there’s plenty to see and do in New World with a plethora of craft-based skills that feed into the game’s economy. Hunting for resource nodes is one of those chore-like pursuits I’ve never really enjoyed in MMOs though it’s somehow more immersive in Aeternum. For example, when woodcutting you’ll actually see trees fall. Rare minerals and fauna are often found scattered around key landmarks, encouraging you to explore and soak in New World’s beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The best thing about my first experience with New World: Aeternum is knowing that I’ve only just scratched the surface. So far it has been a fun and somewhat enthralling solo-levelling experience with more social, multiplayer features beginning to reveal themselves. From player housing, dungeons, and raids, to PvP arena battles and sweeping faction wars, I’m eager to see where Amazon’s MMO will take me.</p>

            <p>I know there's a lot of good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvanias</a> floating around, but I implore you to take a look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardust-demon">Stardust Demon</a>. Developed by two-person queer married team resnijars, it looks like a real charmer.

It's also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.</p>

<p>In Stardust Demon you play as Algol, a fuzzy demon bear (?) who explores alien planets. You'll solve puzzles, do some nice hopping, grind on neon rails, and hit baddies with your powers - of which, there are lots. You've got fire breathe, you've got sticky bombs, a reflect beam, and the best-sounding one? A pogo stick.</p>
<p>As for those planets, there's Wexia, replete with "dangerous flora and fauna" and home to "worm-like and quirky Wexoids". Klonix is the "ethereal planet" and actually home to <em>friendly</em> demons, while Purrafiny is an aquatic number and outpost for "nefarious poachers" and "animal collectors". There are more (some aren't even planets) and, honestly, they look 1000% more interesting and quirky than a lot of worlds I've seen in retro-fied platformers nowadays. The trailer really highlights their diversity. </p><p>Another thing I'd like to highlight is Algol's walk: a very good little plod that makes the physical act of pottering around those vicious planets lighter on the heart in general. Never underestimate the power of a good walk animation, I say.</p>
<p>You can find the game over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815500/Stardust_Demon/">on Steam</a> if you're keen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It’s hard to pick out the highlights from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s latest SteamOS update, 3.6.19, just because its collection of tweaks and fixes seems to span the entire gamut of handheld PC hardware as a concept. Graphics driver improvements! Third-party <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">SSDs</a> working better! More balanced display colours! No more "spurious power LED blinking"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.</p>

<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4676514574283544995">Full patch notes are here</a>. If some of these amendments seem familiar to experienced Deck users, that’s because they’ve been knocking around the Preview and Beta branches of SteamOS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4213757668851885208">since at least May</a>. Version 3.6.19 finally brings them all together on the Stable branch, the default and least bug-prone flavour of SteamOS that I’d suspect the majority of owners have never switched from.</p>
<p>Also, sod it, let’s pick out some of the best stuff. Improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> reliability – especially for certain SanDisk models – sounds good, and I’ve actually bumped into the exact black screen issue when switching between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Desktop Mode</a> and Gaming Mode that this updates banishes. The LCD Steam Deck getting up to 10% better battery life "in light load conditions" might be handy for lengthy download sessions as well, and it’s nice to see that the older model specifically getting more love.</p>
<p>Don’t get your hopes up too much about the suggested graphics performance improvements; I’ve ran a few quick benchmarks in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and neither seem to run any faster. But you might still see better stability in certain RAM-heavy games, and at the very least, I’ll take the higher responsiveness when flicking through the UI. I’ve been testing out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-computex-2024-pc-hardware-announcements-that-are-actually-interesting">Zotac Zone</a> this week (review forthcoming) and, like all Windows-based handhelds, it quickly made me pine for SteamOS’ snappiness.</p><p>Anyhoo, 3.6.19 is available to install right now for all Stable branch users; you can enable the installation in the System page of the Steam Deck’s settings. The only other thing I’d point out is that while the patch notes list some fixes for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">Game Recording</a>, the video-clipping feature itself has still only got as far as the Beta branch. You can switch to that, from Stable, by selecting Beta in the System Update Channel section.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
