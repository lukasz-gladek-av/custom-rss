            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from Korean outlet <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/new-korean-starcraft-rights-ip-nc-soft">VG247</a>) marks the end of a rights battle between Nexon and Blizzard, seemingly resulting in Nexon, not Blizzard, leading development on the next major entry in the StarCraft series.</p>
<p>Blizzard will be working alongside Nexon to create this new StarCraft game, which could potentially be something besides a new RTS game, if Nexon really wanted to shake things up, that is. RTS games are incredibly popular in Korea, as is the StarCraft series. Moving away from the genre is a huge gamble, since the players who are looking for something to follow up 2013's Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm are probably looking for another RTS game, not a different game set in the StarCraft world.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just win the ability to make a new StarCraft game in its rights battle though, it also won the opportunity to make a mobile version of Overwatch for Japan and Korea, which has immense potential considering the popularity of mobile games in Asia.</p>
<p>In both cases, this amounts to a big loss for Blizzard, with Nexon now having the keys to what could be a very lucrative castle that Blizzard has arguably fumbled. Of course, we're still a while away from seeing if Nexon will be able to capitalize on its chance here properly, but the potential is still undeniable at this stage.</p>
<p>Especially if Nexon does come out with a StarCraft game that shows how Blizzard's behind in the genre. That both companies collaborated on the game won't matter to players if Nexon can demonstrate that it was their influence that helped make the next game a success, should it be a success, that is.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate for Blizzard that its track record of late has been other studios showing that they can take something Blizzard did and do it better. It arguably happened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/">Overwatch</a> and how hero shooters have evolved since then. Many would argue that's what <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile</a> has done with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, and Nexon coming in to do the same with StarCraft would be the next nail in the coffin.</p>

			<p>There’s a massive fungaloid infection spreading across a remote moon, and so Saxon is sending their very best crew of exterminators to deal with it. Well… their most willing and cheapest, at least. You’re not the first crew that Roachard has sent down to the surface, and it’s probably best not to ask why…</p>
<p><iframe title="Mycopunk | Reveal Trailer | Four-Player Co-Op Chaos in a Fungal Future ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nT4jTAMY7m8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what kind of game is this? Well, it’s a co-op mission-based shooter. There’s shades of Helldivers 2 to one of the missions in the demo, as you are tasked with dropping down a railgun, setting it up, aiming and then blasting a rival space station out of the sky, with a gloriously huge explosion as your main reward, but that’s maybe more of a thematic overlay. The better comparison, though, would be Deep Rock Galactic for the game’s overarching structure.</p>


<p>You can see that most clearly between missions, where you head to Saxon’s orbital dropship and find a little playground to mess around in while you wait for everyone to lobby up or get their gear sorted. There’s a drop pod right in the middle where you pick your mission and head down to the planet surface, but surrounding it in the main hall is a bunch of elevators up to the rafters, a weird live action TV screen, a tesla pole, a blurred out section (which is amusingly strange), and more. But there’s also a bunch of locked doors and rooms that you want to find secret passages to get around to open up a rail-filled firing range, or gain access to race cars which, if you want, you can actually take down on missions with you by just driving it into the dropship!</p>


<p>There’s a scrappy, grungey style to Mycopunk that I love, its visual style reminiscent of games like Sable, Void Bastards and other cel-shaded games of the last half decade, though with the true roots coming from classic graphic novels and comic artistry of Moebius. It’s all about the thin black lines around objects and differently coloured details, adding a noisiness to simple geometry as you get further away from it.</p>
<p>But then there’s the world and the bizarre aliens that you’re battling once you drop down to the surface. Spawning in from gently waving flame tendrils, they’re all about sinew and slimy limbs sprouting from a central point, often holding up weapons and shields to shoot back at you. For smaller enemies, you can just blast away at their core to defeat them, but their limbs are detachable, which comes in mighty useful when fighting the larger many-limbed Abominations, where you can whittle down the number of sniper rifles, shield domes, smashing arms and everything else that they have before attacking their heart. Just beware that smaller enemies can actually pick these weapons back up and start using them, while the Abominations can sprout new arms if you don’t finish them off.</p>
<p>Combat can become pretty frantic because of this, especially as many enemies will tower over you, though in the demo’s missions it rarely felt like we were truly at risk. OK, so Dom did die once or twice, and when that happens your character is split in half, needing teammates to grab the top or bottom and reunite it to revive you.</p>
<p>There’s four characters to choose from, each with a different movement ability and special skill. Wrangler has a rocket lasso that you can use to drag enemies to you or you to fixed objects, and an air dash, Bruiser has a bullet reflecting shield and slam attack, Scrapper can great a grapple pull for all the team to use and a jet pack, and Glider has rockets that heal allies and a wing suit that lets them fly. The Glider has a clear advantage when getting around, letting them race ahead to objectives, but I’m kind of OK with that not being particularly balanced. Just make sure that you play with people that aren’t going to just abandon you, I guess?</p>

<p>The weapons can put their own twist on things as well. Sure, there’s a standard-ish assault rifle, there’s a shotgun with fire damage, there’s a gun that looks an awful lot like one of Halo’s Covenant sniper rifles, but then there’s the Swarm Launcher. This fires out bullets that then hang in the air until you let go of the trigger and then all drop at once. It’s just such an intriguing weapon that feels immediately satisfying to use.</p>
<p>You can quickly race through the ammo it gives you for your weapon, but thankfully you always have two guns and can just switch to the other. Dealing damage with one weapon restocks the ammo of the other, so you won’t be away from your favourite or better gun for too long.</p>
<p>Mycopunk also dips a toe into that pool of looter shooter upgrades, though with an intriguing twist of its own. Sure, you’re grabbing upgrades that are dropped in missions and earning them from successful completions, and then spending currency to unlock them, but the magic comes from how you slot these together. There’s a 7×7 hexagonal grid where you slot these upgrades together, but they’re not taking up a single slot and instead look more like diagrams of chemical compounds. Standard upgrades will just be a few hexes joined up, while Epic and Exotic upgrades will branch out and sprawl, forcing you to figure out how best to slot multiple upgrades together.</p>
<p>These upgrades also try to stay away from being basic percentage power boosts, in favour modifying how weapons behave. OK, so that might be that a burn effect is beefed up, but it can also be that the Swarm Launcher’s bullets now automatically home to enemies or follow your crosshair, or that you have infinite ammo at the cost of shooting too long hurting you.</p>

<p>From its two mission demo, Mycopunk gives a good first impression. It’s light, it’s fast, it’s a little bit scrappy, and there’s that great art style. As it looks first to a Steam Early Access release, there’s definitely room to grow, and to reveal more of what’s planned. There’s multiple regions down on the planet, there’s more mission types to come, more modifiers, more of a narrative to wrap around things. If you’re looking for a new co-op blaster, this is one to keep an eye on.</p>

Chief among them: a door.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has to do with the door to the Dark Brotherhood’s Cheydinhal sanctuary entrance. It is at the centre of an iconic moment in Oblivion, one that players who took on the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/The_Dark_Brotherhood">Dark Brotherhood quest</a> will probably remember well. In the original Oblivion, the glowing door has a heavy mood aesthetic and a relief showing the Night Mother (who members of the assassination obsessed Dark Brotherhood worship) murdering five children. The Oblivion Remastered version of this door has no glow, is light on atmosphere and, weirdly, has two extra children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see a comparison with accompanying complaint in the reddit post from alvaro-elite, below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some are upset that this new door is a lot less moody than the one in the original, The Elder Scrolls lore fans are pointing out that the addition of two kids on the relief doesn’t make a lot of sense when you consider what we know about the story of the Night Mother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This moment in time is meant to represent the Night Mother’s murdering of the five children she conceived with Sithis, the Elder Scrolls deity who represents emptiness and the Void. As the story goes, the Night Mother is murdered by the locals for murdering her kids, which turns her into the immortal Night Mother in the first place. In fact, in Oblivion, the Night Mother’s tomb includes skeletal remains of one adult and five children, reinforcing this lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why are there seven kids in the scene now, where there were five before? That’s the question fans are asking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no clue why someone just decided to copy/paste two more children on there,” commented redditor AutisticAnarchy. “I guess the larger texture looked ‘better’ with it or something and the artist working on it didn't understand the lore.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m still really confused by the thought-process behind it,” added TurboDelight. “Where’d the extra kids come from? Who thought to change what the mural was actually depicting? I can understand not knowing what the figures are meant to represent, but why change an objective detail like that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“inb4 it's a lore retcon because something about the Dark Brotherhood questline in TESVI is based around lore written about these two extra figures, be they her sixth and seventh children or otherwise,” suggested ConstantSignal..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Or the digital artist tasked with recreating the door just didn't know it was meant to depict significant lore and felt the extra figures filled the space better lol.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is whether Bethesda and developer Virtuos will patch Oblivion Remastered to change the door to be lore compliant, or is this is all part of some masterplan that leads into fun story shenanigans in future games or DLC?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k9itf6/i_feel_really_very_disappointed_with_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>alvaro-elite / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In my opinion, it is a smart time to grab them while prices are behaving themselves.

It packs a PAW 3395 sensor, programmable buttons, a 4K polling rate, and a charging dock that doubles as a signal booster. I want one for a low-key gaming setup that does not look like it is held together with RGB lighting and prayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p>When player housing arrives in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, players will be retroactively rewarded for past achievements in the form of housing decor, with Blizzard stating "all the time spent in Azeroth is worth something."</p><p dir="ltr">In a new <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24196547" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Blizzard continues to pull back the veil on WoW's long-awaited player housing system, confirming that players will be able to earn housing decor in a number of different ways. Common items like chairs, shelfs, beds, etc. will be widely available from vendors, quests, or other players via the auction house.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Some decor, however, will take more time or effort to unlock. Blizzard described these as "investment" items that may require more time or a significant cost to earn. Housing decor can also come in the form of "Trophies," rewards from long-term achievements or completing specific feats that require skillful play, with Blizzard comparing them to current Mythic+ or raid rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard confirmed that new decor rewards tied to past achievements or feats will be rewarded retroactively the first time a player logs in, and that some decor will be integrated into past expansions for players to unlock using expansion-specific systems or currencies.</p><p dir="ltr">Professions from each expansion, too, will play an important role. All non-gathering professions will be able to craft items for housing, with Blizzard laying out a few examples. Blacksmiths will be able to make objects made primarily of metal, enchanters will be able to create magical objects, and jewelcrafters will craft stone-related objects and gem-studded decorations. Decor from previous expansions will require corresponding reagents and the relevant profession level from that expansion, giving players more reasons to go back into the game's past.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of decorating a home properly shouldn't be difficult, but it does want to give players some "reach-goals" throughout the game to shoot for.</p><p dir="ltr">"That said, it should be easily possible to kit out your home on day one to strike the vibe you're looking for without too much effort," Blizzard said. "Your decor journey should start out awesome and continue to be that all along the way."</p><p dir="ltr">Other details shared by Blizzard include that decor items are shared across a player's entire account, so if they have four chairs total and use three of them in the house for one of their characters, other characters will only have one left to use. Some items will also be limited to how many copies players can have, with an example being that it doesn't make sense to have nine copies of Onyxia's head mounted on the wall.</p><p dir="ltr">For WoW players looking for something more to do ahead of housing's arrival, Blizzard hinted that leveling up professions from previous expansions, as well as completing meta-achievements, might be goals worth pursuing for those looking to get a head start on decorating their homes.</p><p dir="ltr">This is just the latest glimpse at WoW's player housing system, which still does not have a release date but is said to be coming alongside the arrival of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMORPG's next expansion, Midnight</a>. Blizzard previously stressed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">housing in WoW will be available to everyone</a> and won't come with "exorbitant requirements." It also revealed the systems players will be using to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorate their homes</a>, as well as how its neighborhood housing system will work.</p>

This means in the last few months, Elden Ring has moved more than 1.4m copies, and will surely shift even more when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">the game makes its Nintendo debut on Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>Elden Ring first released in February 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-review">Aoife Wilson calling it "a glorious game" in Eurogamer's review</a>. A DLC - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> - then released last year, adding a further boost to sales.</p>
<p>"Much of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is more of the same gruelling beauty - but a shift to explicit storytelling and signposting means its essence as a living, evolving shared text is lost," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Eurogamer's Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.</p>

            <p>
If you're in the mood for a bit of mayhem, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> would like a word. The publisher's just unveiled Mycopunk, a new limb-slicing, robo-leaping mission-based co-op FPS that's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/">coming to Steam</a> from developer Pigeons at Play later this year.
</p>
<p>

Mycopunk's very silly action whisks players to a far-flung sci-fi future, where, as employees of space travel company Saxon, they're ordered to go investigate a distant moon and find out why communication has been lost. It's probably not much of a spoiler, given the title, to reveal the answer to that "why" is a fungal catastrophe, and it's up to players - as a rag tag team of extermination robots - to clean it all up.
</p>
<p>
What you have, then, is a mission-based co-op FPS inspired by the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a>, with a focus on movement, weird guns, and an outlandish upgrade system that - as Pigeons at Play explained during a recent press showing - is designed to create cool builds that break the game "in a good way". To that end, Mycopunk features four distinct characters, all pretty agile, that offer synergies when used together, but are all powerful enough that they'll work solo. And with no character limits, all four players can use the same character if they desire.
</p>
<figure>

<a aria-label="Mycopunk | Reveal Trailer | Four-Player Co-Op Chaos in a Fungal Future 🍄" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nT4jTAMY7m8?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>

<p>
There's the Wrangler - the most agile of the bunch - that has an air dash and a rocket lasso they can use to yank themselves in different directions, even grab parts or other players. The Bruiser, meanwhile, is more about up close and personal combat; they come armed with a shotgun and projector shield that can push enemies back, deflect bullets, even be slammed into the ground, causing everyone - including allies - to launch violently into the air.
</p>
<p>
The Scrapper, meanwhile, is the most team-orientated character, capable of deploying a pole all players can grapple onto from a distance, while the Glider has a flying wing suit and a rocket salvo that can be used to terrorise enemies or heal friends.
</p>
<p>
This motley crew of amenable scrap starts each mission on the deck of their rickety space ship orbiting the moon, which serves as Mycopunk's hub and a focus of plenty of between-mission silliness. You can visit your boss, for instance - a giant cockroach who'll provide assistance during missions - rail grind in the Recreation Sphere, or just smack each other around trying out different builds in the hangar. You can even summon vehicles - ranging from individual race cars to four-person rides - and take them on missions. Pigeons at Play is even looking to install working arcade cabinets on the ship, but that might not make it in for launch.
</p>
<p>
As for the mission themselves, they're accessed seamlessly from the ship's drop pod, taking players down to the moon's surface and one of several different biomes. As you might expect, missions come in a variety of flavours, such as planetary defense missions where players are required to power up a large gun then use it to take down the ship of a rival company - and additional layers of variety are introduced through random and even weekly modifiers. 
</p>
<p>
The common theme, though, is one of chaotic combat and carnage as players traverse the large open biomes and face off against swarms of alien creatures and mini-bosses. Mycopunk's twist is that enemies are made up different pieces you can chop of individually - something you'll need to do in order to reach the vulnerable core at their centre. However, dismembered limbs can also be a liability, given other enemies can pick up and use them for themselves. And if that wasn't chaotic enough already, there's also talk of other hazards players will need to contend with, including rare weather events, such as sulphur rain that can turn the ground into goo.
</p>
<p>
But if you manage to survive the chaos, finish off enemies, and complete missions, you'll aquire fistfuls of upgrades to install back on the ship. There are upgrades for guns, grenades, even individual characters' abilities, meaning there's a lot of build flexibility. The wrinkle, though, is that upgrades must be installed Tetris-style in a grid of limited size, with the ability to rotate upgrades only becoming available later on.
</p>
<p>
Upgrades span four different tiers - standard, rare, epic, and exotic tiers - and provide a wide range of effets. They can increase grenade charging speeds, for instance, turn grenades into cluster bombs, imbue weapons with infinite ammo that'll start burning you if you hold fire down too long; you'll find upgrades that let you shoot double the bullets, or charge up ammo then fire it all out at once, and on it goes. And given 40 upgrades can be installed for every weapon, build tinkers should have a whale of a time.
</p>
<p>
And big plans are afoot for Mycopunk post-launch, with Pigeons at Play already thinking about new narrative content, new weapons, new enemies and enemy parts, and new upgrades - with the studio saying it wants to build the latter based on player's desires. Devolver hasn't yet revealed when Mycopunk will launch, beyond a vague "2025", but if you're suitably intrigued, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3581750/Mycopunk_Demo/">Mycopunk demo is coming to Steam</a> soon.

			<p>New Battlefield 6 footage leaked online, providing a new look at the impressive destruction elements of the new entry in the series, ground vehicles, massive maps, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage, recorded during a recent alpha playtest conducted via the new testing environment Battlefield Labs, provides a great look at some of the features and mechanics that will be found in the next entry in the series, which has yet to be officially announced. The destruction mechanics, in particular, look quite impressive, as does the jet gameplay set in a map that looks outright massive.</p>

<p>The destructible elements have always been a very important part of the Battlefield experience, and they will be just as important as in the yet-to-be-officially-announced Battlefield 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">Earlier this month</a>, the development team provided an update on them, saying that their goals for destruction are <em>"centered around adding further gameplay depth by allowing you to reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage."</em>&nbsp; As highlighted by the new leaked gameplay, destruction is being designed around easily identifiable visual and audio language that will allow players to immediately understand what can be destroyed and altered, creating an intuitive and rewarding environment that players can easily shape.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is currently in development for unspecified platforms. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>The Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a> have been revealed today, detailing the system specifications needed to run the game at launch.</p>
<p>As expected for a multiplayer game aiming to get as many players on board as possible, the next game developed by FromSoftware is not going to be particularly demanding, as the developer recommends dated CPUs like the Intel Core i5-11500 and AMD Ryzen 5 5600 and GPUs like the GTX 1070 and Radeon RX Vega 56 to play the game, although it's not specified what resolution and framerate should be expected with the recommended specifications. Elden Ring Nightreign will also not require a lot of free storage space, as the game will only be 30 GB in size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The minimum and recommended PC specifications for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> are now available. <a href="https://t.co/pgfsTZzO1M">pic.twitter.com/pgfsTZzO1M</a></p>
<p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Elden Ring Nightreign was announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> last year</a>, I wasn't particularly excited about its multiplayer approach, but the Closed Network Test held earlier this year made me more interested in the game. The experience was extremely easy to get into and fun, especially when all involved players properly worked together, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>The basics of Elden Ring Nightreign are really straightforward. From the iconic Roundtable Hold, players can decide to undertake expeditions with three other players, picking one of four Nightfarers, which will become eight in the launch version, all coming with unique special abilities, before getting thrown into one of the game's maps, where they need to survive for three days. At the end of the third day, the squad will get to fight one of the main bosses and will be rewarded with relics that represent the game's permanent upgrade system, which improves characters with a variety of different perks. Relics can also be obtained if the squad fails to get to the third day and defeat the final boss, so players still get something for taking part in expeditions.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-bandai-namco-announces.1175421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time once again to cast your gaze to the Lands Between, as publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have revealed another major&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales milestone has been passed.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to pass the 30 million sales mark, which means the open-world Soulslike action RPG has picked up another five million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this figure refers to sales across all platforms, and it also appears to include both digital and physical shipments. Additionally, the figure doesn't include sales for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million after just three days</a>&nbsp;on its release last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=3_--U5rJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=Nbh0jMGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to cross the 30 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that by any metric, this new milestone further cements&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s remarkable success. The figure puts the game in the same league as Warner Bros' phenomenally popular&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">crossed the same milestone back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s huge success, then, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">create a followup to the game</a> in the form of the multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense, at least from an intellectual property-focused perspective.</p>

<p>Even if you're not feeling up to trying out&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s formula-departing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired gameplay, though, you needn't fret.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is also making its way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> this year, complete with the&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>expansion and some special new armor.</p>

<p>The game isn't even the only FromSoftware title in development for Nintendo's new console; it's joined by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, a PvPvE-focused title coming to the new machine in 2026.</p>




<p>While you wait for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch, you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/elden-ring/9p3j32ctxlrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-dev-says-community-built-on-lies.1175418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular Wii homebrew tool Wii Homebrew Channel has been shut down, and its developers have launched an excoriating attack on the originators of the software on which the channel is (or was) based.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OatmealDome</a>, the Wii Homebrew Channel <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> has now been archived, and homebrew group Fail0verflow has blamed the shutdown on the discovery that the libogc library, on which Wii Homebrew Channel is based, contains stolen code.</p>

<p>According to Fail0verflow, "large portions of libogc were stolen directly from the Nintendo SDK (software development kit) or games using the Nintendo SDK". The group says it "thought that at least significant parts" of the library "were original", and so "reluctantly continued to use the project".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=WcPtCnIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=KWi5liHs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what you'll find if you visit the Wii Homebrew Channel GitHub page (at time of writing).</figcaption></figure><p>However, Fail0verflow says it was recently revealed that certain parts of libogc were "stolen from RTEMS", an open-source real-time operating system for which the library "remove[d] all attribution and copyright information".</p>

<p>According to the group, libogc's developers' actions go "far beyond ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo binaries" and stray into "outright deliberate, malicious code theft and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Fail0verflow says libogc's developers are "not interested in tracking this issue, finding a solution, [or] informing the community of the problematic copyright status of the project", going as far as to say the Wii homebrew community as a whole is "built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>As OatmealDome further <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557214904430754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, libogc serves as "the core of all homebrew apps" when it comes to GameCube and Wii homebrew solutions, so Fail0verflow's accusations aren't small potatoes in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=0DIBWMLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=2n6xU0zE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>libogc also forms the basis of GameCube homebrew.</figcaption></figure><p>The shutdown of the Wii Homebrew Channel, or rather the cessation of ongoing development, is a massive blow to the Wii homebrew scene, but unfortunately, Fail0verflow says it can't encourage further development as it's "impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software".</p>

<p>Some might say Fail0verflow is being hypocritical given emulation is a common usage for Wii homebrew software, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Modding a Wii with homebrew software is far from illegal; it's playing copyrighted games or software that crosses that particular line.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see what impact this has on the Wii homebrew scene as a whole, but it's not likely to be a positive one. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>Hello darkness my new friend.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
At long last, dark mode is finally available on RPS. We’ve wanted to bring a dark mode to the site for ages, and many of you have been politely, passionately, and persistently asking for it for quite a while. Thank you for your patience while we reconfigured our stylesheets.
</p>
<p>
You’ll find a new toggle in the site's footer which allows you to switch between light and dark modes at your leisure. Choose what works best for you. Set it to "Auto" and the site will match whatever colour preferences you have set in your computer or phone's operating system. We'll remember your settings for next time, too.
</p>
<p>
We’ve tested the new theme across the site, from long reads to hardware breakdowns to the blessed comment section, but you might spot the odd bug. If anything looks weirdly luminous or hauntingly invisible, feel free to let us know.
</p>
<p>
As ever, thanks for reading, supporting, and enjoy the new look (and extra battery efficiency).

<p>Project Maverick was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-working-on-new-project-based-on-microsoft-ip">first reported back in June 2023</a>. At this time, it was said People Can Fly's Project Maverick would be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m, and based on one of the Xbox maker's existing properties.</p>
<p>While details have remained sparse since then, People Can Fly has now revealed what Project Maverick is via its "about us" section in the <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/investors-en/#o-firmie">studio's investor website</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/pcf-s-project-maverick-xbox-game-has-been-revealed/ar-AA1DLC3n">XboxEra</a>). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, Project Maverick is actually Gears of War: E-Day. The developer was revealed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>People Can Fly is "currently working on seven projects", the developer's investor website now reads. "Gemini, a new AAA game developed in partnership with global publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>; Maverick (Gears of War: E-Day), in collaboration with Microsoft; Echo, a mode to the existing game developed for Krafton; and projects Bifrost and Victoria (Lost Rift) to be released in the self-publishing model."</p>
<p>In addition, People Can Fly is "also involved in a VR technology project named Project Bison, a new title in the immersive VR action survival genre" and Incuvo - a group subsidiary - is "actively working on the further development of a separate VR project, Green Hell VR".</p>
<p>Incuvo released the rather messy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm-vr">Bulletstorm VR</a> port. Eurogamer's VR aficionado Ian Higton took Bulletstorm VR out for a spin on release, and he was left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-bulletstorm-vr-really-as-bad-as-everyone-says-it-is">pretty disappointed by the whole thing</a>, calling it sloppy.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War: E-Day, it's a prequel title for the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wizordum-review-homage-to-heretic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in a time where remasters for games are a dime a dozen, doubly so for boomer shooters. So why, then, is it the year 2025 and we still haven't seen a remaster for <em>Heretic</em> and <em>Hexen</em>, two of the most influential shooters of all time? Thankfully, Emberheart Games and <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/apogee-entertainment" rel="nofollow">Apogee Entertainment</a> have created a worthy successor to those two with <em>Wizordum</em>.</p>

<p>I'm still going to beg the powers that be to remaster those two absolute classics, but <em>Wizordum</em> certainly tickles that <em>Heretic</em> itch. It's deeply inspired by those titles, of course, but also incorporates modern elements to liven up the gameplay into something more than just an imitation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-spooky-mansion.jpg?itok=Qwk_oBVO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-spooky-mansion.jpg?itok=bvjYi57_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The best solution to killing a ghost is with a giant fireball, of course.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Wizordum: </em>Every Level, an Adventure</h2>

<p>If you pay attention to the retro shooter scene, <em>Wizordum</em>'s been around for a bit. It's an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/wizordum-preview-nostalgic-dungeon-delving-fps" rel="nofollow">Early Access</a> title, but the final episode (and a slew of fixes and tweaks to existing episodes) make this now a complete package. With three episodes, a bunch of magical weapons, and a ton of treasure, expect <em>Wizordum </em>to take you on quite an adventure.</p>

<p>And indeed, if there is one word that comes to mind with <em>Wizordum</em>, it's that: "Adventure." Boomer shooters are often known for their winding paths, getting lost, or hunting for keys.&nbsp;But constantly retreading old paths isn't an adventure. It can feel tedious. That's not the case with <em>Wizordum</em>, thankfully, despite how vast the levels feel.</p>

<p><em>Wizordum</em>'s levels are chock-full of treasure and secrets, and if you're into secret hunting, this game is absolutely for you. If you like running into walls, pressing the action button, and hoping to find a secret area, <em>Wizordum </em>fulfills that satisfaction. Usually, you gain treasure or ammo for your curiosity, meaning exploration is rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-shop.jpg?itok=tN591-G_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-shop.jpg?itok=yzEASQ7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What are ya buyin'?</figcaption></figure><p>Treasure can then be taken and exchanged for various upgrades at the end of levels. This is one part that I didn't see in Early Access; basically, complete a level, and you can buy secondary actions for weapons, or increase your capacity to fire spells attached to your chosen character. It adds a sense of progression in a genre that doesn't usually have much of that.</p>

<p>And yes, I mentioned characters. There are two, in fact, and they come with different spells and a unique primary weapon. The Cleric with his mace, or the Sorceress with her wand, whatever you choose, means your experience will vary. The Cleric and Sorceress also vary in health, armor, and speed, so pick what fits your play style.</p>

<p>The choice of two characters does merit some replayability, but the gameplay differences aren't so vast that it's a completely different experience. Nonetheless, I could see myself going back as the Cleric in a second playthrough, once more scrounging the world for the vast amounts of treasure I missed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-episode3_1.jpg?itok=ge3fJ-4D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-episode3_1.jpg?itok=3gBrCKDR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nice.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Strong Finish for <em>Wizordum</em>'s Episode 3</h2>

<p>If exploration is so greatly emphasized in <em>Wizordum</em>, one would hope that levels have creative and distinct layouts, and that's definitely the case here. Across <em>Wizordum</em><u>'</u>s three separate episodes, you can expect to fight in monster-infested villages, swampy ruins, spooky mansions, caverns of lava, and so much more.</p>

<p>You can tell, developer Emberheart Games got more confident and creative with level design after each episode. Episode 1 plays it pretty safe, and as such is the most bland of the three. It's not bad by any means, but compared to Episode 2 and especially Episode 3, it takes some time for <em>Wizordum</em> to build up.</p>

<p>Episode 2, then, is better than Episode 1, with more creative level design and elaborate puzzles. One level, for instance, takes place on a ship full of goblins. The ship feels a bit more claustrophobic and smaller in comparison to other levels, but that layout keeps things feeling fresh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-ep-3.jpg?itok=K8v9GLrT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-ep-3.jpg?itok=FTJ4xRHE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's also gonna get chilly.</figcaption></figure><p>Episode 3 is the cream of the crop, with much larger levels, a higher difficulty curve, and essentially just combines all of what makes <em>Wizordum</em> great into a satisfying conclusion. One level, for instance, takes place in this sprawling, maze-like mine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were numerous approaches players could take in this interconnected network of tunnels. The goal was to find several gems to unlock a certain door in the center, and the path I took to gather all of these likely will look different than yours. Even still, I didn't feel lost, which is a testament to <em>Wizordum</em>'s handy map.</p>

<p>In general,&nbsp;the final episode has a much stronger visual design, too. Episode 1 and some aspects of Episode 2 are repetitive. Episode 1, for instance, has a lot of dilapidated villages and stone buildings to the point where much of it feels like you're walking in circles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-gauntlets.jpg?itok=qOeKNvMX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-gauntlets.jpg?itok=koC1urOq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unlimited powerrrrr!!!!</figcaption></figure><h2>Runnin' and Slingin' Spells in <em>Wizordum</em></h2>

<p>Like any good retro shooter, though, level design is just one piece of the pie. Gunplay, with a diverse set of weapons, is the other crucial component for a good shooter. Thankfully, I don't have much to complain about in that regard. By and large, <em>Wizordum</em>'s gunplay feels satisfying, and players are powerful.</p>

<p>It's easy to make guns sound powerful and intimidating, but spells, that's another story. With the exception of a magic pistol, every other weapon has that wizard flavor to it. Rings that let you cast fireballs, an icicle-shooting staff, or even lightning gauntlets -- I'm a fan of them all.</p>

<p>The ice staff, in particular, makes a satisfying sound when its projectiles impact enemies. The staff freezes them in place, so you can hit them once more with a weapon to shatter them; better yet, freeze a bunch of enemies in a group and shatter them at the same time for a satisfying end to your battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-ice-staff.jpg?itok=yH6tNNuX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-ice-staff.jpg?itok=VRCQP-bv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to freeze, pal.</figcaption></figure><p>You're also armed with a supply of items a la <em>Heretic </em>and <em>Hexen</em>. These all give gameplay benefits in one way or another, be it by healing you, turning you invisible, and the like. As mentioned, characters have specific spells, and those will also come in handy a great deal, especially on higher difficulties.</p>

<p>The Sorceress, for example, can reflect projectiles with one of her spells, which is a godsend when you're being overwhelmed. There's a time-based spell that greatly increases your attack speed, and that's also handy when taking down more powerful foes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-rat.jpg?itok=aB2Q8Z2G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-rat.jpg?itok=M7aC5PzL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes you can find a rat mount, and I just like how this screenshot turned out. Looks like I'm about to run over this stupid little goblin.</figcaption></figure><h2>Wizordum Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Every episode is capped off with a boss. My review build didn't have a final boss, so my opinion could very well change, but the first two were rather dull. Like most boomer shooters, bosses amount to bullet sponges, and that just doesn't do much for me anymore. The second boss had a hint of nuance, but at the end of the day, it's point and shoot.</p>

<p>There were also a fair number of bugs, some of which I hope are fixed upon release. I fell below a level once and had to revert back to a save, for instance. Sometimes, enemies would be stuck in walls. Heck, the first boss just sat there and let me shoot him without any resistance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizordum-screenshot.jpg?itok=HZkLgz83 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizordum-screenshot.jpg?itok=t8td7Bl3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Such ambiance!</figcaption></figure><p>Despite a few flaws, <em>Wizordum</em> is a competent retro shooter with a lot of creativity and charm. The bright visuals serve as a nice contrast to the usual dark-and-gritty shooters, and it has a calming and whimsical soundtrack as opposed to a high-octane, all gas, no breaks sort of deal.</p>

<p>Whether you're diving into <em>Wizordum</em> for the first time or checking out the brand new Episode 3, you'll find this to be quite the enjoyable boomer shooter. No, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but not every game needs to, so with that said, it's hard to go wrong with a bit of spell-slinging action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-star-wars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that five more games have joined its Preservation Program, and since May 4th is just around the corner, it's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>' turn to be recognized this time.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/lets_celebrate_may_the_4th_with_classic_star_wars_games_joining_the_gog_preservation_program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, GOG says it wants to honor the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>franchise "by adding iconic classics from a galaxy far, far away" to the Preservation Program.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, the Preservation Program is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> through which GOG is pledging to keep certain games updated forever, ensuring that they'll be able to run on any PC hardware whether or not their developers are still officially supporting them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gog-preservation-program-battlefront.jpg?itok=prBu0gBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gog-preservation-program-battlefront.jpg?itok=6d8LCx_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars: Battlefront&nbsp;</em>is one of the games being added to the GOG Preservation Program today.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the five games that have been added to the GOG Preservation Program today. Bear in mind these are the originals, so remasters for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-release-date" rel="nofollow">Dark Forces</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Battlefront&nbsp;</i>aren't included here (and in the case of&nbsp;<em>Battlefront</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response" rel="nofollow">that might be a good thing</a>).</p>

<ul><li><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces&nbsp;</em>(1995)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars: X-Wing Special Edition&nbsp;</em>(1993)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars: TIE Fighter Special Edition&nbsp;</em>(1994)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars Battlefront&nbsp;</em>(2004)</li>
	<li><em>Star Wars: Rebel Assault 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>(1993 and 1995, respectively)</li>
</ul><p>To celebrate these games' addition to the Preservation Program, GOG has also slapped a pretty hefty 75% discount on all of them. That discount runs until May 6th, so make sure you pick them up before then if you want any of them.</p>




<p>As for what lies ahead when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>games, the future looks bright for the franchise. Recently, Respawn and Bit Reactor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, a turn-based tactics game set towards the end of the Clone Wars.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">making its way to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recently confirmed it was "unaffected"</a> by sweeping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> at parent company NetEase, so hopefully, we'll be hearing from that game sooner rather than later.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/oblivion-to-starfield-bethesdas-20-year-journey-to-elder-scrolls-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-to-starfield-bethesdas-20-year-journey-to-the-elder-scrolls-6.1175364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/oblivion-to-starfield-bethesdas-20-year-journey-to-elder-scrolls-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's something to be said about the loyalty of <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> fans when Bethesda can re-release a 20-year-old game with no official marketing and it still ends up at the top of Steam's bestseller list. Amusingly, there's even a non-zero chance that some of the people who are currently playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> weren't born when the game first came out.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this loyalty isn't entirely undeserved when you look at Bethesda's history. For all the complaining that people do, and some of it quite justifiable, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-15th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">Bethesda's games are very much one of a kind</a>. For RPG fans, they somewhat literally define a console generation.</p>

<p>There have been no shortage of competitors either. Every so often, an RPG comes out with better mechanics than what any Bethesda game has to offer, yet time and again, people keep flocking back to <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/morrowind-imperial-legion.jpg?itok=tiix8Oa6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/morrowind-imperial-legion.jpg?itok=bFS7P9Ka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Patrolling Morrowind almost makes you wish for a volcanic eruption."</figcaption></figure><p>After all, it's hard to argue that contemporary games like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" rel="nofollow">Avowed</a> </em>don't have objectively better role playing mechanics. The <em>Dragon Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> games blow Bethesda games out of the water when it comes to the writing for romances and companions, not to mention actual reputation systems. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a> is in an entirely different league in almost every practical metric if you overlook the differences in sub-genre.</p>

<h2>What's in the Secret Sauce, Todd?</h2>

<p>Indeed, most people would fully acknowledge that <em>The Elder Scrolls'</em>&nbsp;approach to combat has historically been its weak point. The writing for faction quests in particular can be hit or miss too. Throw in the increasingly simplified reputation system and ever present bugs and you might wonder what do <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> games actually offer to deserve their fame.</p>

<p>The answer is that very few games on the market have player-to-NPC interaction, player-to-world interaction, NPC-to-NPC interaction, and NPC-to-world interaction running more or less seamlessly and simultaneously. To put it simply, Bethesda specializes in creating living worlds, and sometimes "it just works."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-spriggan.jpg?itok=5iXcb-8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-spriggan.jpg?itok=xYvkvINp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With graphics such as these, it's time for another <em>Skyrim </em>remaster!</figcaption></figure><p>Case in point, <em>Oblivion </em>is a 20-year-old game where NPCs have their own schedules and can react to changes in their environment. They'll walk around, go to sleep, talk to each other, and if you commit crimes, they'll react appropriately. You can then walk up and talk to, rob, murder, or simply observe most NPCs and they'll more or less act logically. The same feature (with some tweaks) has since been a key feature of Bethesda's major RPGs.</p>

<p>By comparison, most developers opt for static NPCs because it's (presumably) easier, faster, and less prone to causing problems. Recently, <em>Avowed </em>was criticized for this as you could literally steal food off people's plates and they wouldn't react at all. Was it easier for the developers? Most likely. Did it bother people who care about such things? Almost certainly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skyrim-riverwood.jpg?itok=m4G9XizD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skyrim-riverwood.jpg?itok=0QEPpxL3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If the NPCs are standing around and doing nothing in a Bethsda game, that's usually a sign that you might want to reload the area or restart the game entirely.</figcaption></figure><p>In purely practical terms, there's no difference between the two approaches. At the very least it seems doubtful that the average player is following <em>Oblivion </em>or <em>Skyrim's </em>NPCs around to make sure that they are eating and sleeping. The difference is that Bethesda's approach maintains an illusion of a living world, and for such games it goes a long way to engaging with players.</p>

<p>A living virtual world isn't created "simply" by having NPCs that can move though. The world itself needs to feel like people lived in it. In <em>The Elder Scrolls'</em>&nbsp;case, that means making up 10,000 years of history. Civilizations rise and civilizations fall, so Bethesda isn't just writing a made up culture for each of the playable races, they're also creating societies that might have gone extinct for peoples who no longer exist or have simply undergone a culture shift.</p>

<p>This means distinct clothing styles, architecture, religions, languages and naming conventions, even literature. While inspiration can be taken from real life, as evidenced by <em>Oblivion's</em> Western European-themed Cyrodiil, you've still got the truly alien Shivering Isles in the eponymous DLC and the planes of Oblivion to contend with.</p>

<p>It's nothing short of a herculean task, and while other game developers can and have produced similarly amazing work, Bethesda remains one of the best in the field for a good reason.</p>

<h2>Did Bethesda Forget The Strength of Their Own Games?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Bethesda seems to struggle once they leave their area of expertise. <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fallout-76-review-total-wasteland" rel="nofollow">Fallout 76's</a> </em>early years certainly didn't do much to disprove this notion. Between the lack of NPCs, live-service multiplayer with no private servers, and PvP where you can lose your loot, it's a small miracle that the game survived long enough to be updated to a more palatable state.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/starfield-review-interstellar-adventure" rel="nofollow"><em>Starfield</em>'s mixed reception</a>&nbsp;only intensified people's concerns regarding the future of <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>. Make no mistake, <em>Starfield </em>had some novel gameplay mechanics, but features like randomly generating the surfaces of 1,000 planets lacks widespread practical appeal. If anything, Bethesda should've realized this when <em>Oblivion </em>was first released, if not earlier with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="nofollow"><em>Morrowind</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eso-content-pass.jpg?itok=_uheZOIT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eso-content-pass.jpg?itok=aLnJr93Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Supposedly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/" rel="nofollow"><em>Elder Scrolls Online</em></a> is a decent way to get your<em> Elder Scrolls</em> fix if you don't mind MMO mechanics</figcaption></figure><p>That AAA game development is trending towards greater complexity is not a comforting fact either. Bethesda's games are notoriously buggy as is. One can only imagine the problems that can arise when you add more features, more NPCs, more of everything. Granted, most of the common bugs in Bethesda's games aren't really game breaking, so it's more of an unfounded fear than anything else unless you are diving deep into modding.</p>

<p>The potential for feature creep is a far greater concern. We went from building our own houses in <em>Skyrim </em>to building settlements in<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-4-5-year-anniversary" rel="nofollow">Fallout 4</a></em> to building spaceships in <em>Starfield</em>. It's a very neat feature that can be improved upon in <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>. However, if Bethesda intends to treat the building aspect the same way that they "improved" the settlement system in <em>Starfield </em>by making it needlessly complex and tedious, then it's better to omit it altogether.</p>

<h2><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>- From Oblivion to Skyrim to Hammerfell and High Rock?</h2>

<p>That being said, it seems questionable that anyone genuinely believes that <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>&nbsp;will be literally unplayable at launch. Whether or not it will live up to people's high expectations of both the franchise and the developer is up to debate, which is the real cause for concern.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eso-alliances.jpg?itok=Z0Ae46We 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eso-alliances.jpg?itok=_SbD_7VC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If there's anything that <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> should borrow from <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, it's the fashion styles and transmog system.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the success of the <em>Oblivion</em>&nbsp;remaster should provide at least two bits of good news for Bethesda. The first is that people still love the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games, warts and all. <em>Oblivion </em>is fundamentally the same game as it was 20 years ago, and if people can overlook the strange quirks of the game today, then that's a good enough baseline for determining the absolute bare minimum of what <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>&nbsp;should feel like.</p>

<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is that Bethesda should be able to get relatively fresh feedback. Again, it should be pointed out that there is a non-zero chance that some of the people who are playing <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> weren't born when the original was released. Even returning players should be able to provide better feedback with an additional 20 years of context. That there is no release date for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>means that time is on Bethesda's side, and they can and should course correct if needed before it's too late.</p>

                <p>EA and DICE recently conducted the latest Battlefield Labs testing period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and despite participants agreeing to not share footage online, that's exactly what's happened. Lots of new gameplay videos from the alpha test recently made their way online, and the footage looks pretty impressive.</p><p>Among other things, the videos show off Battlefield 6's new destruction elements, while we also see player piloting a jet, zipping across a massive map. Other videos show off some of the game's numerous ground-based vehicles.

<p>Our Ed has already gone hands-on with Nightreign.</p>
<p>"Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Eurogamer's Nightreign preview</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yotei%E2%80%99s-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more.1175313/</guid>

			<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40353">Famitsu</a>, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-shares-new-ghost-of-yotei-details-as-the-games-non-linear-campaign-is-explained/">VGC</a>) Sucker Punch's Nate Fox and Jason Cornell, both co-creative directors on Ghost Of Yotei, spoke about the Yotei's non-linear campaign, the game's story, and a bit more about the setting, and the research Sucker Punch did while crafting Yotei.</p>
<p>Last week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">release date trailer</a> provided a few quick story details, like how the game centers around new protagonist Atsu's quest for revenge, which Fox reiterates in the interview here.</p>
<p>"<em>The main theme of this game is revenge. The main character, Atsu, has a big trauma in her childhood and goes on a journey to get revenge,</em>" Fox said.</p>
<p>Fox also described the game's map, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yotei has the greatest freedom and biggest map of any open-world game we have ever made</em>."</p>
<p>More interestingly, Fox and Cornell talked about the immense research they did on the studio's second attempt to capture Japan, how the studio collaborated with experts on Japanese history, and, of course, went to the Hokkaido prefecture, where the game is set.</p>
<p>"<em>We have received cooperation from various advisors regarding the depiction of the Ainu people and Ainu culture of the time. Like with the previous game, we have also thoroughly researched Japanese culture and incorporated it into this project,</em>" said Fox.</p>
<p>"<em>I also went to Hokkaido to research Ainu culture,</em>" Cornell added,&nbsp;"<em>and had people knowledgeable about Ainu culture introduce me to museums and folk crafts, which I incorporated into the worldview of this work. By the way, I also went to the mountains with them and had the experience of picking wild vegetables</em>."</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to arrive on PS5 this coming October 2, 2025, and while it'll surely be its own game compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, there are more than a few striking similarities between the two. The plot, for one, sticks out as a considerable similarity as they're both focused on tracking down several people who have wronged the protagonist.</p>
<p>Gameplay will surely be a big differentiating factor, but overall it'll be interesting to see how both games shape up by the time we've played Ghost of Yotei.</p>
