            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone who has played ARC Raiders knows that Scrappy the Rooster exists. He’s a quirky little bird that struts around your Raider Den, collecting all kinds of resources while you’re off topside fighting the ARC – and other Raiders. But nobody really knows how he got there and what his purpose in life is, besides gathering scrap items.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has just set the story straight on where Scrappy came from and why he exists in ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-scrappy-has-an-origin-story">Scrappy Has an Origin Story</h2>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-story-of-scrappy-the-rooster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders website</a>, Johan, a 3D artist working on the game, revealed the origin story behind Scrappy, everyone’s favorite and lovable rooster character:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was living with my parents at the time – they happened to keep chickens. Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p>



<p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong>&nbsp;Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p>



<p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>got his chance to shine.&nbsp;</strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p>



<p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon.&nbsp;</strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a quaint story, but it perfectly explains why Scrappy exists in a world so devoid of animal life. Most of the humour has been sucked clean out of the world on account of it being a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but knowing that Scrappy is waiting for you when you return to Speranza is always a nice touch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Since Fortnite launched in 2017, it has had some downright insane collaborations. The latest one is due to arrive this coming Sunday, November 30, 2025, with the previously unreleased Kill Bill chapter, Yuki's Revenge, coming to Fortnite as part of the Quentin Tarantino collaboration.</p>



<p>Epic Games put out a new teaser trailer for the collaboration today, giving us our first look at the chapter that never made it to the silver screen, but will now see the light of day more than 20 years after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 2.</p>



<p>Fortnite has been a part of several 'firsts' for video games, and this has to be a new one, as it's currently difficult to recall another time when a previously unreleased chapter of a popular film was showcased for the first time as part of a popular video game, instead of, say, a movie theatre.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7h1aMVdBEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, the short will be shown in theatres, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/yukis-revenge-premieres-in-fortnite-on-november-30?lang=en-US">according to a blog post on the Fortnite website</a>. "<em>Starting December 5, participating theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will show Yuki’s Revenge as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of </em><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>US players who purchase a ticket to go see the short in theatres between November 20 and November 29 will also receive a code for the in-game Gogo Yubari outfit at participating theatres. </p>



<p>This weekend in Fortnite also marks the end of Chapter Six and the beginning of Chapter Seven, with Zero Hour kicking off this coming Saturday, November 29, 2025.</p>

            <p>
It is not exactly a secret that, in recent years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> hasn't been doing so hot. Frequenters of the pseudo-MMO have found certain expansions and updates to be disappointing, and for a live service game a few too many disappointments can be devastating. Now, in a new interview, the game's director Tyson Green has acknowledged how the game is struggling to bring in a new audience, and discussed the difficulties that come with that.
</p>
<p>
"For years now, Destiny has been on this steady hardening of the core [audience]," Green said, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>. "More and more core players are staying and playing the game, but relatively few [new] people come into the game. There's a tightening and contraction, and this presents problems for a game that you're trying to maintain as a live service, especially when you want to keep serving those core players with great, compelling expansions."
</p>
<p>
Part of the issue, Green thinks, is that Destiny 2's expansion The Final Shape, which essentially wrapped up the main story Bungie had been working on nigh on a decade. They found that those that played it felt satisfied, but "the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?"
</p>
<p>
Of course, as Green notes, from a business perspective this isn't what they had planned, and he noted that they wanted to and want to keep working within the world of Destiny. "There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something."
</p><p>
That something is the game's new Fate saga, the latest addition of that being the Star Wars themed Renegades. I'm not a Destiny person myself, and I can tell you personally that has someone who has floated the idea of picking the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> up, Star Wars does nothing for me (I think brand crossovers are the devil's work, particularly in narrative-driven live service games), and just how much of the story is vaulted away makes it feel not particularly worth it either.
</p><p>

Perhaps slightly soberingly, Green also said that he thinks Bungie have "been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny."

</p><p>
There are whispers from a source whose reputability I can't quite determine, so take this with the tiniest pinches of salt, <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752">that Destiny 3 is in the works</a>, but I am wondering if this isn't the trump card Bungie may want it to be. And with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">Marathon as it is</a>, well, Bungie can't really afford to make any mistakes.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/</link>
            <guid>1365898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re just weeks out from the start of the Call of Duty League 2026 season, and teams are starting to be unveiled. The organizations across the board are lifting the lid on jerseys, rosters, and operating models, as the Call of Duty esports world prepares for what could be one of the most ambitious seasons in CDL history.</p>



<p>Next season, the Call of Duty League comes back to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>many years</strong>, teams have been shaken up more than <strong>ever</strong>, and the Call of Duty League Championship is headed back to <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>



<p>Gentlemates is the latest team to uncover its four-man roster heading into the new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-your-gentlemates-have-been-confirmed">Your Gentlemates Have Been Confirmed</h2>



<p>Gentlemates, which assumed control of the Los Angeles Guerrillas spot last season, has confirmed the four-man starting lineup ahead of the commencement of the 2026 CDL season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon</li>



<li>Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</li>



<li>Daunte ‘Sib’ Gray</li>



<li>Travis ‘Neptune’ McCloud</li>
</ul>



<p>It was a mixed season last year for these players, but perhaps none more so than Neptune, a superstar player who broke back into the CDL under the Vancouver Surge banner, going on to land in second place at multiple Major tournaments <strong>and </strong>at COD Champs. It was <strong>almost </strong>Neptune’s greatest season ever.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ghosty and Envoy migrate from LA Thieves, their spots overtaken by a restructuring that has finally pulled aBeZy out from under the FaZe banner.</p>



<p>LAT won Major 3 and Major 4 and went on to top the chart by the end of the season, but a hugely lacklustre performance in Kitchener at COD Champs saw the team drop out in seventh place after being defeated by Boston Breach <strong>and </strong>Vancouver Surge. There’s likely very little love lost between Envoy, Ghosty, and Neptune.</p>



<p>Sib comes over from Cloud9 NY, a rehash of the old New York Subliners roster that was also taken over last season. It was a horrible year for C9NY, with the team failing to secure a spot of traction the whole season through, falling extremely short and not even making it to Champs.</p>



<p>Ironically, C9NY <strong>still </strong>finished above LAG M8 in the season standings.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a busy year in the Call of Duty League. Let me know what roster you’re most interested in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-mtg-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-superdrop-2000647703</link>
            <guid>1365883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Secret Lair x <em>Monster Hunter</em> drop was revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251121083502/https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-monster-hunter-superdrop">just last week</a>. It featured a number of characters and creatures from the hit Capcom multiplayer series and a Sol Ring promo card in each drop. But fans were not impressed. The card selection for the reprints was criticized for being uninspired and having nothing to do with the series it was drawing from. In fact, the fan reaction was so loud <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">that Wizards of the Coast</a> has done something completely unexpected: take the Secret Lair drop back to the drawing board.</p> <p>“We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better,” the company <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter">announced on Wednesday</a>. “We’re going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.” Wizards admitted it “missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of <em>Monster Hunter</em> and plans to rework the Superdrop in the meantime. Details on the new set won’t be re-revealed until next year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We care a lot about the worlds we get to celebrate, and Secret Lair x Monster Hunter didn’t quite come together the way it should have. We hear you, so we’re heading back to the drawing board to rework this Superdrop. More to come.<a href="https://t.co/dtHublSB13">https://t.co/dtHublSB13</a> <a href="https://t.co/yMkaUPaUWI">pic.twitter.com/yMkaUPaUWI</a></p> <p>— MTG Secret Lair (@MTGSecretLair) <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1993726445193990451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Players had three main complaints about the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter collaboration. The first was that the card selection was pretty bland and not aligned with the series’ lore. Valstrax, the silver Elder Dragon, was <a href="https://x.com/TheTrinketMage/status/1990867324048421298">a Sol Ring</a>&nbsp;despite being neither an artifact nor a ring. Some took issue with the color selection for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1p0lerg/official_magic_the_gathering_x_monster_hunter/">various references</a>, as well as the card art.</p>

 <p>The general bewilderment was best encapsulated by the Champion of Kotoko card, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1p0i9dq/monster_hunter_secret_lair_champion_of_kotoko/">misspelled Kokoto</a>, the village from the very first Monster Hunter game. It didn’t help that many of the reprinted cards had a second-hand market value well below the $30 and $40 Superdrops.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Upon further inspection some of the Monster Hunter x Magic The Gathering cards don't look too good</p> <p>Velkhana and Malzeno especially look a bit weird, like they had their face smoothed.</p> <p>Yuan Garuga also looks goofy and then there's Champion Of "Kotoko" <a href="https://t.co/bbyOFVHpUG">pic.twitter.com/bbyOFVHpUG</a></p> <p>— DarkHero (@DarkHeroCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkHeroCC/status/1991154721541722419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One MTG YouTuber summed up the response with a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NASy37-CGaE">The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Sucks</a>.”</p> <p>Now that Wizards is redoing the set from scratch, some fans are hopeful it might just go the route of making completely unique cards rather than picking other card reprints to tag with new<em> Monster Hunter</em> names and art. Or Wizards could bring back the “craft” mechanic from<em> Lost Caverns of Ixalan,</em> given <em>MonHon</em>‘s emphasis on creatures and equipment. There have also been requests for Capcom’s own artists to contribute to the illustrations.</p> <p>Whatever the revised Secret Lair Superdrop ends up being, Wizards says not to get used to this sort of reversal. “Pulling Superdrops back isn’t something we’re going to do very often, but we’re committed to doing better,” the company wrote today. “Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Invented a Whole New Genre and Nobody Noticed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/</link>
            <guid>1365880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun audiences worldwide, retaining a player base equalling hundreds of thousands of users a month after launch. It has proven to be one of the most energetic, electrifying games of the year, storming up the charts and taking over social and streaming platforms with ease.</p>



<p>What many don’t seem to have noticed is that ARC Raiders didn’t just disrupt an existing genre; it <strong>created a new one</strong>. This stellar title from Embark Studios has been dubbed an extraction shooter by <strong>all comers</strong>, but it’s not… It’s something else entirely.</p>











<p>ARC Raiders is <strong>not </strong>an extraction shooter, but an extraction <strong>adventure</strong>. This naming convention hasn’t been used before, and every other game in the space that walks a close line to ARC Raiders typically refers to itself as a simple ‘extraction shooter’.</p>



<p>With ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has gone <strong>beyond </strong>the fundamental term and created a category that better describes the nature of this game. It’s a broader, bolder, and more sizeable extraction title than we’ve ever seen, packed with lore and an intriguing backstory that’s being explored over the next few years, all being well.</p>



<p>This is what I mean by the naming conventions, taking what other developers and publishers in the space refer to their game as on storefronts and in marketing materials:</p>



<ul>
<li>Escape from Tarkov – ‘Extraction FPS’</li>



<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Incursion: Red River – ‘First-Person Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Zero Sievert – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Gray Zone Warfare – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>PUBG: Black Budget – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>
</ul>



<p>And then <a href="https://arcraiders.com/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s ARC Raiders</a>… <strong>Extraction Adventure</strong>.</p>



<p>The game’s blurb relays this sentiment perfectly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ARC Raiders blends the tension from extraction shooters with atmospheric settings from the adventure genre. Lurking threats—from deadly machines to other Raiders—create a constant ebb and flow of intensity, where every moment is charged with the thrill of high stakes. Extract valuable loot and explore the unfolding mysteries of a vibrant, lethal world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been dubbed an ‘immersive world’ that unfolds over multiple biomes, taking players from arid environments to cold, surgical facilities carved deep into mountainsides. The social elements of ARC Raiders make it more unpredictable than anything to emerge in the space in years, and it’s that uncertain edge that makes each raid ‘absolute cinema’.</p>



<p>With some RPG elements woven into the game’s skill paths, a far-reaching story that’s being drip-fed to players over time, and the ability to lead an experience over several iterations of characters, each with different opportunities, ARC Raiders really is in a league of its own.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that Embark Studios has dubbed ARC Raiders an ‘extraction adventure’, or would you call it something else? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-new-18-36-player-mode-annihilation-trailer-2000647688</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>has always been a chaotic, competitive game of sensory overload. Developer NetEase is deciding to lean further into that by giving the hero shooter a mode that triples the number of players on screen at once. Happy first anniversary, heroes.</span></p> <p><span>The 18v18 Annihilation mode is exactly what it sounds like. The 36-player mode pits two teams that are three times the size of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-dog-healer-twitch-streamer-2000647271"><span>your usual </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>stack</span></a><span> against one another and crosses its fingers that your PC and console can handle it. I’m thinking of all the technically demanding attacks and effects in this game, and wondering what happens if you have 36 players using them at the same time. Will your PS5 crash if 36 Doctor Strange players open portals up on one map? We’ll find out tomorrow when the mode goes live.</span></p>

  <p><span>Funnily enough, you could have an 18v18 match made up entirely of different heroes with the game’s expansive roster, though the trailer shows some match-ups of multiple of the same character, like a fight of mostly players waddling around as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962"><span>Jeff the Land Shark</span></a><span>. With this many heroes on the field at once, any characters with big, game-changing area-of-effect moves are going to thrive, I will say, seeing Star-Lord auto-aiming with his ultimate as a crowd of helpless enemies’ health bars ticked down did scratch an itch in my brain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Will this be what gets me back into </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>? Probably not. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>and I worked out our differences</span></a><span>, and I’ve got a battle pass to complete. I doubt this mode is going to become the go-to competitive play style for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>players, but it will probably give them something fun to do for a few weeks before everyone inevitably goes back to playing the standard 6v6 format. I look forward to seeing the crazy clips of shenanigans players pull off.</span></p> <p><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>just entered its fifth season, which added Gambit to the roster. Rogue will join the fray during the mid-season update next month.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[World of Warcraft: Midnight Is Officially Launching on March 2, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/</link>
            <guid>1365844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has just confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, the eleventh expansion pack for the most popular subscription-based MMORPG, will be released on Monday, March 2, 2026 at 3:00 PM Pacific Time.</p>



<p>An earlier rumor from leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> a February 26, 2026 date. It appears that Blizzard has finally settled on taking a few more days, though it really is a nearly insignificant delay compared to the date listed in that report.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight is the middle chapter of the trilogy known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>. This narrative was conceived by returning writer Chris Metzen, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-metzen-blizzard-retires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Blizzard in 2016</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-christ-metzen-returning-lead-franchise-wow-next-generation-of-adventures/">returned in 2023</a>. Following the events of the previous expansion, The War Within, Xal’atath, the so-called Harbinger of the Void, returns to Azeroth and unleashes utter chaos in her wake. The ensuing invasion strikes at the heart of the Blood Elf homelands in Eversong Woods. Meanwhile, the looming Voidstorm threatens to extinguish all light and cover the world in darkness as it arrives over the ancient elven kingdom of Quel'thalas.</p>



<p>As mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my previous Deep Dive article</a>, the expansion introduces player housing through the so-called Neighborhoods, the new opt-in Prey bounty hunting system, the new Haranir Allied Race, the new Devourer specialization for the Demon Hunter class, four explorable zones (the Eversong Woods, which have been merged with the Ghostlands; Zul'Aman; Harandar; and the Voidstorm), eleven Delves, eight Dungeons, three Raids, new PvP content (a new Battleground and the Training Grounds as a permanent mode), a reimagined Silvermoon City that now hosts the Horde and Alliance both, and other improvements to User Interface and transmogrification. In the campaign storyline, players will have the option to choose which of multiple paths to complete first.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Midnight Arrives 3.2.26 | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK_-6glk2MM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While you'll have to wait for early March to play most of the content in World of Warcraft: Midnight, player housing is actually being made available in early access starting next Tuesday, on December 2, for those players who pre-purchased the expansion. To celebrate the arrival of this long-requested feature, Blizzard crafted a range of special rewards across all its games for players who move into their first home and earn the new 'Welcome Home' achievement in World of Warcraft.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 players can look forward to the following in-game unlocks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Xal’atath Symmetra Legendary Skin</li>



<li>Xal’atath Symmetra Spray</li>



<li>Xal'atath Symmetra Name Card</li>



<li>Dark Heart Player Icon</li>
</ul>



<p>Hearthstone players will unlock the Hearth &amp; Home Card Back. Furthermore, separate from the WoW achievement, the collectible card game now hosts a new, limited-time in-game event, 'Welcome to the Neighborhood!', featuring an earnable Epic event card.</p>



<p>Lastly, in StarCraft II, players will be able to show their allegiance in every match with the new Horde and Alliance StarCraft II skins. Weirdly, there won't be any Diablo IV tie-in unlocks.</p>

Look, ok, I get it Square Enix. I understand why you put 2B in absolutely everything. She is a character with particular qualities that certain audiences found very appealing! But I am begging you… stop putting her in things. I'm sick to death of seeing her everywhere, her blindfolded eyes somehow still staring directly into my soul, begging me to spend money on endless gacha rolls, but this time in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a>, the next game she's set to appear in.
</p>
<p>
It's even easier to understand why she's in this one, it's another Square Enix game after all, they don't even have to do any annoying brand deals. On this particular occasion, rather than as a playable character (presumably because her fighting Sephiroth was too much for even Square Enix), 2B will be a boss fight you can take on. Which means that really, the main draw will be the outfits for a few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> characters.

<p>
The two graced and/or cursed depending on how you look at it with such outfits are everyone's favourite ninja Yuffie, puppy-boy Cloud, and the more predictable choice out of the two, Tifa. I fear for what this might do to Clerith shippers that think this is a sign that Square Enix has a preference, but I digress.
</p><p>
More than anything, I would just like Square Enix to let Yoko Taro either make or, if they are working on one, announce a new… anything, honestly, but a fresh entry into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>'s world would be nice. The poor moon-shaped head lad can't seem to catch a break at the moment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-creator-yoko-taro-would-like-you-to-know-he-has-been-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-cancelled">what with him saying games he's been working on keep getting cancelled</a>. We're quickly approaching Automata's 10th anniversary! Let the endearing oddball get on with it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Longtime English studio <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-canceled-splash-damage-layoffs-1851735308">Splash Damage</a> is facing an uncertain future as it begins a consultation process that will affect all staff and likely lead to layoffs.</p> <p>On November 26, Splash Damage publicly announced online that the studio was entering a “studio-wide consultation process” that would involve all employees across all roles and disciplines. This follows the London-based studio being acquired in September by a private equity investor after being sold by its previous owner, Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>“This was a difficult step for us to take,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">Splash Damage via a message shared on LinkedIn</a>. “But we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We’re committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.”</p>

 <p>Splash Damage already suffered layoffs earlier this year after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122"><em>Transformers</em> game it was working on was canceled</a>. The last game the studio shipped was 2020’s <em>Outcasters</em> for Google’s now-defunct Stadia game streaming service. Before that, the studio, which was formed in 2001, had developed various popular multiplayer games, including <em>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink,</em> and helped Xbox as a support studio on <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> titles. It also developed <em>Gears of War Tactics.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It is the latest round of bad news for the video game industry as developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs">continue to be laid off and studios closed as publishers tighten their belts</a> and begin<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251"> investing more into AI generation tools</a>.</p>

            <guid>1365829</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In first-person shooters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">especially older games or retro-inspired boomer shooters</a>, the first gun you get tells you a lot about the game. And in <em>Mohrta</em>, your first weapon is a powerful, accurate, hard-hitting revolver that makes the<a href="https://youtu.be/jRrommJ5V9w"> famous M1-Garand “ping” noise</a> every time you reload it. This is just one of the many reasons why I adore <em>Mohrta,</em> which is out now on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"><em>Mohrta</em>, which launched last month</a>, is a non-linear first-person shooter built in GZDoom that has big <em>Morrowind</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> vibes. And yes, I know mentioning<em> Dark Souls</em> in a blog or article about video games risks mockery,&nbsp; but the way this game’s save shrines work and the pacing of each of the worlds you visit, plus its challenging boss fights, create <em>very </em>similar vibes to a FromSoftware RPG. Except you have a shotgun. <a href="https://youtu.be/e_HT14h35eg">Wait, actually, FromSoftware did that, actually</a>. Huh…anyway, I mentioned <em>Morrowind</em> because <em>Mohtra’s</em> strange dark fantasy universe has similar aesthetics to Bethesda’s popular RPG, too. But again, with more guns.</p>

  <p>In <em>Mohrtra</em>, you play as an undead knight-like machine-man who is determined to clean up all the nasty, strange creatures and oddities infesting the land while tracking down someone important. To save the lands and find this person, you’ll need to explore various worlds that ramp up in difficulty, but which can be completed in any order you desire. You start with a powerful sword and badass revolver and grow your arsenal with a shotgun, a bizarre grenade launcher, an SMG that fires bones, and some other really odd weapons I won’t spoil here. All of the weapons feel great, and because the game is built in GZDoom, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-gzdoom-source-port-graf-zahl-ai-chatgpt-2000636055">a modern source port of id’s classic ’90s FPS</a>, gameplay feels snappy, fast, and punchy.</p>

 <p>You also have a small talking doll that can heal you and a vulture on your shoulder that provides light when exploring dark caverns or ruins. <em>Mohtra</em> is weird if you haven’t got that yet. But I love it. Returning from levels to the large market hub world is always a treat. The strange denizens of this world are always willing to chat and trade with you, letting you upgrade your gear and guns, making future missions in new worlds easier.</p>

 <p>All of this is drenched in gorgeous retro-inspired textures and effects. Forests are foggy and gloomy. Lava-filled caves are dark and foreboding. Ancient ruins look deserted and lonely. Immaculate vibes going in this one. <a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067">Who needs 4K raytracing when you got the <em>Doom</em> engine?</a></p> <p>If you are craving a five-to-seven-hour oddball boomer shooter that isn’t just about running through corridors and killing soldiers or zombies,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"> I’d hop over to Steam and check out <em>Mohtra</em></a>, one of the best FPS games released this year. And tell me how you think <em>Mohtra</em> is pronounced.&nbsp; I’ve been saying “mow-CH-ru.” But I heard someone say “MAHT-ra.” I don’t know, I’m too busy shooting creepy skeleton men with my bone gun to worry about that kind of stuff.</p>

These are very similar to the WH-1000XM5 in form factor, features, and sound quality. While they aren't quite as powerful as the XM5 model, the XM4 headphones still offer excellent playback quality and noise cancellation.

Positioned between The War Within (2024) and the future expansion The Last Titan, Midnight marks a major return to one of Azeroth's most iconic settings while pushing the overarching saga toward its cosmic climax. Revealed during this past summer and <a href="https://google.com/search?q=gamespot+gamescom+warcraft&amp;udm=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcased heavily at Gamescom</a>, the expansion signals a dramatic escalation in the war between Light and Void.</p><p>Set in a fully rebuilt and reimagined Quel'Thalas, Midnight centers on a massive Void invasion led by Xal'atath, whose manipulations during The War Within left Azeroth vulnerable to the voidlord Dimensius. The Void now seeks to claim the Sunwell--a source of potent magical energy--and plunge the world into terror. Players will work to reunite the fractured elven tribes, forge alliances with ancient powers, and ultimately join the Light's armies in a desperate effort to repel the Shadow once and for all. Zones such as Eversong, Zul'Aman, Harandar, and the Voidstorm will be heavily featured for the campaign. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_-6glk2MM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oK_-6glk2MM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Midnight introduces several major gameplay features and progression updates, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">including player housing</a>, a long-requested addition to the game. The expansion also debuts a new Allied Race, the Haranir, an ancient, root-dwelling people from the hidden zone of Harandar whose flora-grown architecture evokes the natural magics of early Azeroth. Players will be able to choose their zone progression order after completing Eversong, offering additional flexibility in how the campaign unfolds. Alongside returning lore heavyweights such as Wrathion, Khadgar, and Alexstrasza, the story pushes deeper into the tumult of the Worldsoul Saga.</p><p>Onboarding systems for both new and returning players are being refreshed as well. Beginners will now flow from <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24226733" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Exile's Reach directly into a streamlined "story mode"</a> version of Dragonflight, complete with narrative versions of raid finales, ending at level 70. Returning players can take a guided recap tour through Arathi Highlands with Jaina or Thrall, unlocking gear scaled to their level and covering core gameplay essentials like skyriding and interrupts. There will also be a War Within catch-up--designed to hit the expansion's major story beats in just a few hours--that helps new and returning players progress smoothly from level 70 to 80 as they enter Midnight and continue the Worldsoul Saga.</p>

<p>Splash Damage, the studio behind games like Gears Tactics and Star Wars: Hunters, is facing layoffs that could impact the entire company.</p>



<p>These new layoffs are happening just two months after Splash Damage was sold by former parent company Tencent to an unknown group of private equity investors. </p>







<h2 id="h-splash-damage-layoffs-are-studio-wide">Splash Damage Layoffs Are “Studio-Wide”</h2>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, it was announced that the company was <strong>“entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles.”</strong> This consultation, they say, was a <strong>“difficult step” </strong>for the company, but it’s one that they believe is <strong>“necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market.”</strong></p>



<p>This is the second time this year that Splash Damage has faced layoffs. After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/transformers-reactivate-cancelled-splash-damage-to-lay-off-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate</a>, the studio said that it needed to scale down in order to <strong>“refocus our efforts on other projects.”</strong></p>



<p>Those efforts included Star Wars: Hunters, a game that released on mobile in June 2024. In January 2025, the game released in Early Access on Windows, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-hunters-is-shutting-down-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled just two months</a> later with the game shutting down fully on October 1, 2025.</p>







<p>The company’s statement on Wednesday ended with a promise to “explore every option” in order to retain as many employees as possible, while giving support to those who will be let go.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care,”</strong> they said.</p>



<p>Formed in 2001, Splash Damage has worked on a mix of its own games while also co-developing other titles. Games on its resume include Gears of War 4 and 5, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, and Doom 3. Currently, the studio is working on an open-world survival game called “Project Astrid”. That game was announced back in 2023, but no updates have come since. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask if the sale had anything to do with the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega is pointing to consumer expectations for “definitive editions” as one potential cause behind lower-than-expected sales for some of its recent games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/416531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameBiz</u></a>, the Sonic the Hedgehog and Persona company opened up about its performance throughout the last few months during a Q2 financial briefing Q&amp;A session with shareholders yesterday. The conversation (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-is-aware-its-past-definitive-version-releases-could-be-deterring-players-from-buying-games-at-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>) saw Sega address the thought process behind why sales for its new premium and free-to-play games failed to meet expectations despite generally positive reviews from critics and fans.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega says a number of elements could be contributing to disappointing returns, including competition from other releases within the same genre, as well as launch prices. The gaming publisher also suggested gamers could be passing on purchasing games at launch due to an expectation they will eventually be able to purchase “definitive editions” of those same titles further down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Definitive editions, which typically encompass video game re-releases with relatively minor visual upgrades and additional content, have become a popular tactic for publishers to utilize throughout the last decade. Sega is no stranger to the idea either, especially when it comes to Persona and Shin Megami Tensei developer Atlus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio has a history of pushing re-releases for games like Persona 4 and 5, which received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-4-golden">Golden</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-royal">Royal</a> versions a few years after their initial launches. There’s also Shin Megami Tensei V, which originally released in 2021 and went on to come to more platforms with its Vengeance counterpart in 2024. Atlus’ latest, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio"><u>Metaphor: ReFantazio</u></a>, released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S late last year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega didn’t specifically call out any game or franchise when pointing to its definitive edition theory. The company also generally seems hesitant to directly place the blame on any one factor for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we haven’t been able to pinpoint a precise cause of [the lower-than-expected sales performance], we believe the problem also lies in our marketing, which wasn’t able to sufficiently convey the appeal of our games to users,” a Sega spokesperson told investors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Metaphor: ReFantazio or any other Sega series will receive a definitive edition or equivalent re-release in the future. For now, fans are eagerly awaiting any news Atlus may have to share about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-6-everything-we-know-so-far"><u>Persona 6</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-presents-a-much-needed-refresh-with-a-star-wars-twist</link>
            <guid>1365778</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Destiny 2 gets closer to its tenth anniversary, the shared world action-RPG is currently at something of a crossroads. Following the end of The Final Shape, many players struggled to keep up with the steep power grind and evolving saga set up by The Edge of Fate. It's hard to deny those clear stumbles with Destiny 2 in 2025, but there's still so much potential for strong storytelling and slick action within the growing universe of Bungie's satisfying online RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's what makes the upcoming Renegades expansion an interesting next step for Destiny 2. It not only seeks to realign the ascent to greater power for players but also expands the universe with a pulpy, sci-fi storyline that leans right into the influence of Star Wars. After getting an early hands-on experience with Destiny 2: Renegades, I got to appreciate the way that developer Bungie is rethinking Destiny 2's power grind, and how they're getting players to embrace the scoundrel's life as they navigate the shifting battle zones of the new Lawless Frontier.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destiny 2: Renegades – Weapons Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Renegades picks up after the events of The Edge of Fate, with The Drifter warning the Guardians of a threat led by a new Cabal faction known as the Barrant Imperium and a mysterious fallen guardian named Bael. Embarking on a new mission without support from the Vanguard, The Drifter and other returning allies will form alliances with the growing network of syndicates within the new Lawless Frontier – all to take on the Barrant Imperium, fight back against the fallen guardian, and uncover the larger conspiracy that The Nine are working towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's not so much the Star Wars universe invading Destiny 2, a la Fortnite, but rather Destiny 2 leveraging its own lore for its take on a Star Wars story.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What's interesting about the story with Renegades is that it's simultaneously the next phase of Destiny 2's ongoing Fate saga – setting up changes to the galaxy's power dynamics – yet it's also an expansion that pays deep homage to the Star Wars series. It's not so much the Star Wars universe invading Destiny 2, a la Fortnite, but rather Destiny 2 leveraging its own lore for its take on a Star Wars story. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destiny 2: Renegades – Gear Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Tyson Green, Destiny 2: Renegades taps into a similar conceit to the Forsaken expansion and its space western revenge plot. But the opportunity to collaborate with Lucasfilm on a Star Wars crossover allowed them to take it further with a compelling crossover for the Renegades expansion. "One of the advantages that the new release model gave us, which is two expansions a year, means you can experiment more within those individual expansions – you can try different things," Green said. "So we saw what we wanted to do with a 'space western' revenge story, and we figured, let's do it in that one, let's aim for this. So we took the idea of Star Wars as total inspiration and built a Destiny expansion around it; that's kind of how we always do it. In this case, I think it comes through much more richly, because it's being more deliberate with its influences and style, but it's still fundamentally a Destiny expansion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, it can come off as an extended series of cheeky references, and it initially took me some time to get used to the visual homages to Star Wars iconography – such as a near one-to-one recreation of the opening of A New Hope, complete with movie-accurate sound effects. But I got more into it as it went on, and I appreciated the attempt at trying to make a front-facing mash-up of sorts. I especially had a blast hopping into a giant walker to mow down foes. So far, it feels like a good fit, and honestly, much of the Star Wars aspect fits, given that Destiny and most modern sci-fi and fantasy media already have Star Wars DNA baked in. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destiny 2: Renegades – Environments Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with the Star Wars connection, Renegades also introduces the Blaster weapon variant, and just like Han Solo's and Chewbacca's guns from the movies, the Blasters hit hard and can fire quickly. They're essentially laser weapons that require venting to avoid overheating, which is a fair tradeoff considering how useful they can be in a fight. To be clear, these aren't totally new weapon archetypes, but rather new guns with a twist, some of which are variants of older guns like the Sweet Business exotic. But the added wrinkle of venting guns in between downtime does change up firefights a bit, and it can be super satisfying to tear into enemies with a Gatling Blaster rifle that feels right out of The Clone Wars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By far the most unique weapon to acquire is the exotic Praxic Blade, Destiny 2's take on the lightsaber. Though similar to Destiny 2's existing power swords, the Praxic Blade is an exotic special weapon that deals heavy damage and grants guardians the ability to deflect incoming enemy fire, and can even be thrown like a boomerang to deal ranged damage. It's a very satisfying weapon to use, and the exotic quest to acquire it was a strong mission that made me feel like I was taking on a trippy Jedi challenge. I don't use swords too often in Destiny 2, but I ended up using the Praxic Blade a lot more than I thought I would, given how useful it was against crowds. Also, playing as my Warlock really allowed me to live out that Jedi fantasy within Destiny.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destiny 2: Renegades – Lawless Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike The Final Shape and The Edge of Fate, the primary campaign of Renegades takes a less guided approach and doesn't steer you into the core missions to make progress. Outside of the key story missions that will take you to bespoke locales, the majority of the action in Renegades focuses on building up your reputation within the Lawless Frontier, where you'll take on various missions ranging from smuggling, sabotage, and bounty hunts of key targets. Your new home base is the Tharsis Cantina on Mars. In this social space, you and other guardians will build up your reputation with the different syndicates vying for power within the Lawless Frontier. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The majority of the action in Renegades focuses on building up your reputation within the Lawless Frontier.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the expansion doesn't introduce a new destination to explore. It instead focuses on building up the Cantina social space and the excursions into the new battle zones across Mars, Europa, and a remixed Venus in the Lawless Frontier activities. This does make for a smaller scope, but I felt more engaged with how I could take my time before jumping into new activities, which focus on solo or fireteam missions fighting rival syndicates. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the new systems in the Cantina is the Syndicates, three factions vying for control of territory across the Lawless Frontier. In keeping with the scoundrel fantasy, you'll have to decide which of them you'll work with to build up a reputation and unlock rewards. My favorite faction was the Tharsis Reformation, a Vex sect that broke away from the machine hivemind and gained its own sentience – and it also wears its own jackets to showcase its individuality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The syndicates are an interesting addition, and it really helped to showcase the Cantina as a fully realized den of scum and villainy – and you can even bribe characters within the social space to get tips on secrets within the Lawless Frontier. But what I really liked about the Syndicates in particular is that they felt like a more developed version of the Faction system from Destiny 1. In Renegades, you're actually helping these syndicates amass power within the Lawless Frontier, which will unlock bonus Renegade abilities to use in the field and more specialized gear. This especially comes into play with some missions that focus on contested territories, which require you to take on priority contracts to help your chosen syndicate secure them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with core creative director Ben Womack, he stated that a valuable lesson learned was that it's necessary to think beyond boundaries and try to expand upon the usual structure and tone when necessary. The opportunity to make a Star Wars-themed Destiny 2 expansion helped the team rethink elements of the game's signature style and structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think my big lesson that I learned is that when you're making something new, you often have a bunch of conventions and boundaries that you have to consider, especially for games that have been around for a long time like Destiny," Womack said. "It's tempting to stick to those conventions as being the boundaries of the rules, but the truth is that you need to re-examine all of them every single time when trying to really create something special and make a splash. This is especially true when having a partnership with Lucasfilm. We looked at how we made the sandbox stuff we've done, we now have blaster weapons that will stay with us going forward, seeing how the Praxic Blade turned out, and we have the various new syndicates that turned out well. There are things that we definitely wouldn't have done, but we had to accept and push past those usual boundaries to do these things, and as long as it's still fun and people are responding to it, and the feel is there, then it's the right decision."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was really impressed with how chaotic and exciting the Lawless Frontier jobs were. These PvE-focused missions feel like stepping behind enemy lines, where you have to complete dynamic objectives. It really kept my team constantly on the move, and once the job was complete, we had to make one last sprint to the exfil to complete the mission, or else suffer the consequences. One of the big twists with these missions is that you can activate new Renegade abilities to call in support drops. I was able to summon a vex shield for protection, call in an aerial bombardment, or even activate battle armor to dish out to help even the odds. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was really impressed with how chaotic and exciting the Lawless Frontier jobs were.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what difficulty you're playing on, the challenge can really ramp up quickly, especially when playing on a mission that allows for enemy player invasions. Much like the Gambit mode, a lone rival player can step into your squad's game and take you out to earn rewards for their syndicate. You can opt out of missions with invasions. Still, it does present a fascinating and unnerving twist to the missions, and you're not totally punished for getting wiped out by a particularly devious player who can get the jump on you. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, gaining power and earning the new gear to develop your guardians is the big drive for playing Destiny 2. Unfortunately, players struggled to keep up with The Edge of Fate's shifting power levels and steep grind, leading many longtime players to move on. During our hands-on, the developers were candid about how they handled that approach in the previous expansion, and one of the larger updates coming with Renegades is realigning the game's power approach so it won't require as many hurdles to overcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with a refocused loot pool that will be a bit more generous and balanced with getting players powered, there are also new and refreshed activities and pinnacle ops for players to take on, which include more difficulty tuning options for players who want to maximize their chances for gaining solid loot. Along with 300 new storage slots in the vault, the portal menu and its variety of noteworthy missions to tackle will also see a refreshed version of the Seasonal Hub, which offers additional rewards for players to acquire by completing daily and weekly challenges that will give more incentive to dive into the activities of the hubs. This system was introduced in The Edge of Fate, but Renegade's updated version is easier and more inviting to engage with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the game director, they took the criticism to heart following the release of The Edge of Fate and have been steadily releasing updates to make the next expansion one that keeps players engaged and not frustrated by the grind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We looked at the problem that we had and we said, 'We think there's a route here,' which is leaning into more systems of pursuit, getting new tiers of gear, armor sets, and power progression, and things like challenge customization," Green said. "These things that can allow a core audience of players to really say, like, I'm really gonna take this game and put it through its paces, and get good rewards for it. It sounds great on paper, but it didn't work. I think we've been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: there are live games that listen to the players and respond to them, and then there are dead ones.  And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny. So we're listening to our players, and what our players are telling us is that they don't want to chase a simple number that goes up, they want real rewards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I wasn't able to get a sense of the larger pursuit of power with my limited hands-on time, I did appreciate that Destiny 2: Renegades feels a bit more generous with its loot quality and ways to move up. Those pain points in Edge of Fate made the progression a slog, but with Renegades, I found myself getting a lot more into the flow – plus I really liked that it allowed me to get the Praxic Blade fairly early on. However, I do worry that D2's new direction with the Portal hub continues its menu-heavy focus. It's convenient, for sure, but it's also a bit of a headache to navigate, and it lessens the motivation to visit the various social spaces and destinations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Destiny 2: Renegades feels like a proper step forward for the live-service pioneer's next chapter, making for a more player-conscious experience. It's certainly not looking to reinvent Destiny 2 with a new sprawling campaign, but rather, realign its approach to getting players back into the right flow that doesn't feel like a drag. Along with the new Star Wars-inspired campaign that taps into it, it could end up being the right kind of course correction that Destiny needs – plus it's fun to see a Star Wars story play out in the Bungie’s universe.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-presents-a-much-needed-refresh-with-a-star-wars-twist]]></content:encoded>

If you're familiar with the history of this specific Dragon Quest entry, then you likely already know Reimagined is the second time Square Enix has remade Dragon Quest VII.&nbsp;</p><p>It released the original Dragon Quest VII in 2000 on PlayStation in Japan and a year later as Dragon Warrior VII in the U.S. Square Enix remade it for the Nintendo 3DS, launching Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past in 2013 in Japan before releasing it in the West in 2016. Now, Square Enix is remaking it a second time, with Reimagined launching next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>It's rare to see a single entry get this many remakes, so we've created two galleries to show you the differences between the original Dragon Quest VII, the 3DS remake, and Reimagined, using the same spot across the years.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gallery 1: Original vs. 3DS Remake vs. Reimagined</h2><h2>Gallery 2: Original vs. 3DS Remake vs. Reimagined</h2><p>As you can see, the differences are pretty stark due to hardware limitations and varying visual styles and aesthetics. We're excited for Reimagined, though, and you can read about why in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait"><em>Game Informer </em>cover story here</a>, and if you aren't already a subscriber, be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Which visual style for Dragon Quest VII do you like best?

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/digital-foundry-dives-into-tomb-raider-definitive-editions-big-downgrades-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1365760</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_9EQ02fVA8">Digital Foundry</a> have delivered their tech review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a>, which shadow dropped onto Switch 1 and 2 last week, and it's something of a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Starting on a positive note, the Switch 2 version of the game sets out to hit 60fps, and it does so <em>c</em><em>onsistently</em>. DF's Thomas Morgan notes that he noticed "barely any drops" when playing in either handheld or docked modes, so that's a big bonus for fans of smoothness.</p>
<p>What's more, the Switch/Switch 2 'Definitive Edition' boasts many of the re-release 'pros' over the PS3 original — upgraded textures, foliage placement, colour grading, etc. — and renders at 1920x1080p resolution in docked (similarly hits 1080p in handheld). Nice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some pretty glaring visual omissions in the Switch version to get things running at the specs outlined above. Shadow density is pulled way back, foliage thickness is reduced, the advanced TRESSFX for Lara's hair is MIA, and many of the cutscenes' cinematics are dialled down for simplicity.</p>
<p>It falls behind the Definitive Edition's PS4 release, in this instance, but strangely, there are select points where the Switch 2 version is even a step back from the PS3 original. There are no screen-splat rain effects, the geometry is more simplistic, and even shadow coverage is a bit of a downgrade. It should be noted that these cutbacks <em>also</em> apply to the PS4 re-release, but, as the DF video states, "the drawbacks are disappointing, given the multi-generational divide between the systems".</p>
<p>For those wondering about the Switch 1 version, the older system runs things at 30fps (sometimes dipping into the 20s in demanding cutscenes), with a "surprisingly respectable" 864p-900p. Many of the visuals are matched between the systems, and while Switch 1 does see a further drop in shadow quality, it "holds up much better than you might expect," according to DF.</p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED reported its latest financial results today with its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">third-quarter 2025 earnings report</a>. The report included a couple of notable updates on the studio's ongoing projects and a significant update about the studio's most infamous release, Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>After what no one will deny was an absolutely disastrous launch, true to its word and commitment to try and right its wrongs, CD Projekt RED has overhauled and patched Cyberpunk 2077 to the point where the game has now sold <strong>35 million copies</strong> since it launched in December 2020. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cyberpunk-2077-Hit-35-Million-Copies-Sold-Nov-2025.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: CD Projekt RED</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This announcement comes almost exactly a year to the day after CD Projekt RED announced Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">had reached 30 million copies sold</a>. </p>



<p>No one will soon forget how, in 2020, CD Projekt RED withheld PS4 and Xbox One copies of Cyberpunk 2077 from reviewers ahead of launch, only handing out PC copies pre-release in an attempt to mask how poorly it ran on those previous-gen consoles and protect its pre-orders, and the backlash that followed. </p>



<p>That said, now that we're almost five years out from that disaster, even though it took CD Projekt RED three years to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-release-date/">Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 patch</a>, we're arguably at the point where we can say CD Projekt RED has earned the ability not to be forever judged for Cyberpunk 2077's 2020 launch.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though the real test of whether players can really trust CD Projekt RED again will come with the release of its next major title, The Witcher 4. Its launch will likely be the difference maker between whether players entirely abandon CDPR or start to really trust the developer again.</p>



<p>Speaking of The Witcher 4, work on the return of CDPR's other major franchise has continued to be the company's main focus, with 447 developers all working on it. Meanwhile, the percentage of developers working on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel continues to scale up, with 135 developers now spread out between the studio's Vancouver, Warsaw, and Boston branches, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/">the latter of which was opened specifically to work on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Once The Witcher 4 is out the door, we can expect to see more of the company move to working on Project Orion, which is the given code name for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which CDPR has also begun calling "<em>Cyberpunk 2</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>We are very happy and satisfied with the fact that - despite the passage of time - Cyberpunk 2077 remains such a well performing title and continues to attract new players</em>," said Michał Nowakowski, joint chief executive officer of CD Projekt RED in today's presentation. "<em>Sales of the game have exceeded 35 million copies, which testifies to the franchise's enduring power and enables us to be even more audacious about charting its future</em>."</p>
