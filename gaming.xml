			<p>Many years after the original announcement of No More Room in Hell 2, the game is finally about to launch in early access, having recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-early-access-starts-october-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the October 22 date - just in time for Halloween. Chivalry studio Torn Banner acquired Lever Games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-resurfaces-3-5-years-later-early-access-launch-slated-for-halloween/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is bringing the project to completion</a> at last.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, I chatted with Kenneth Bourgon, Marketing Manager at Torn Banner Studio, about how the developer became interested in No More Room in Hell 2. Bourgon also outlined the current and future content plans.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to me about No More Room in Hell 2. I know Torn Banner didn't make the first one, right? Why did you think of this game?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the first one was created by Lever Games in 2009. It was the first ever Half-Life 2 Source mod, a pure passion project. It was like 10 to 20 developers that worked on it, and then 9 million players played the game. Later on, when they started working on the second one, their dynamics all changed for the most part, like the amount of time that they had to invest out of university on the first game just wasn't the same on the second.</p>
<p>At the same time, Matt 'Maxx' Khazan, who led the project, was working his day job at Torn Banner, so he started talking to our CEO, Steve Piggott. What happened was they started realizing that the original Chivalry also started as a Source mod, and they felt like there was a real shared heritage between the two. What ended up happening is that most of the people working on the Lever Games project for No More Room in Hell 2 came to Torn Banner. So a lot of the people that were working on the original are with us now, still working on the second game, and it just felt right. It felt right that it was a studio in Toronto, a bunch of developers who knew and loved the game, and a genre that we were really interested in going in.</p>
<p><strong>This sequel is a bit different from the first one, right? It's an open world, after all.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, there's a few differences. First, we want the same feel as the first game, so it is a slower, methodical, strategic zombie game. But it is open world, and there are a couple of changes. In the first game, it was all linear levels, and you're always trying to escape the zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>In No More Room in Hell 2, we kind of flip that around. It's an open world, and as a player, what you're doing is at the center of this map, there's a power plant that's going down. What you're trying to do is get to it and turn it back on. It's an 8-player co-op game. One of the really interesting parts is that you're going to start out by yourself on the exterior of the map, all by yourself in the dark, with a flashlight, a small weapon, and a dream. You're going to make your way towards the center of the map, and as you do, there's many of what we call places of interest around the map.</p>
<p>Each of these has a similar objective of turning the power back on. It's all done via puzzle-like objectives, so you have to decide who's doing the puzzles and who's defending against the zombies. As the power comes back on, you're going to create a beacon for players who haven't found anyone yet. They're going to see that this place has its lights on, there's people there, it's safety and they're going to make their way towards it.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an in-game map?</strong></p>
<p>There is, I believe, going to be an in-game map, but we really wanted to keep the user interface as small and as little as possible. The first game was really well-known for its realism, and with this one, we're trying to keep the UI and us to an absolute minimum and have players use their tools around the map. We're going to have proximity chat, and then we'll have a buddy-up system, where if you do meet some players, you can buddy up with them.</p>
<p>We really want people playing the game with the headphones if possible, as the experience is meant to be scary and then slowly build up into something that's maybe a bit more fast-paced.</p>
<p><strong>No More Room in Hell 2 certainly sounds different from the usual zombie game. For instance, I recently played Killing Floor 3, which is round-based and highly fast-paced.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the idea behind this really is your slower burn zombie game. The first game was made purely as a love letter to video games, zombie games, and Romero movies. Our goal for this game is to really make the player feel like they can go into their very own zombie movie from the 80s, 90s, 2000s, and for us, the most important part was pacing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, you start out slower and alone, maybe with more fear, and then as you make your way to the center of the map, the game should change, and by the end of it, when you're 8 players in the power plants, it should build up to be a lot more fast-paced, but we really do want pacing that makes this game always feel like you're moving on to the next thing. In the 30-minute session, you actually get quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>I suppose that once you get to the power plant, you will fight off a horde of zombies while waiting to be extracted with a helicopter or something like that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. At the power plant especially, you're hoping you have as many players as possible because it has a similar kind of puzzle-like objective where you're trying to get that power plant back on, but the power plant is so large, you're going from kind of building to building doing these puzzles. You do have to wait for a helicopter to come and pick you guys up. I think that, again, it goes back to the pacing of the game and making sure that you get a little bit of everything as you play this game and you leave with that intensity that I think as Torn Banner we feel really good at.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our goal with this game is to create a sandbox-ish scenario. What I mean by that is that you should have multiple ways of solving the problems. For each of our main objectives, there should be multiple different ways of going in and doing what you want to do. So, we want to give our players as many tools as possible. Stealth is definitely going to be an aspect of that. Players should be able to decide how they want to move around, especially at the beginning, when you're alone alone with next to nothing, stealth is probably your best choice.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Is there an element of stealth in No More Room in Hell 2? Can you sneak behind zombies to take them out if you want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Our goal with this game is to create a sandbox-ish scenario. What I mean by that is that you should have multiple ways of solving the problems. For each of our main objectives, there should be multiple different ways of going in and doing what you want to do. So, we want to give our players as many tools as possible. Stealth is definitely going to be an aspect of that. Players should be able to decide how they want to move around, especially at the beginning, when you're alone alone with next to nothing, stealth is probably your best choice, and then things change throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Is noise a factor, too, in that you may risk attracting a lot of zombies?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we also have a zombie type in our game that is there to cause a lot of noise, which is a lot of fun. That is something that is definitely going to throw a bit of a shake to people's plans. And yes, overall, we have cars with alarms we have. You're going to have to be very careful about how you go through the map.</p>
<p><strong>Can you use it to your own advantage sometimes with environmental traps?</strong></p>
<p>That's exactly what we're hoping for. These things have two sides of a coin, where if you're not planning it, it's probably a bad thing. But you do see how siphoning zombies in certain locations and driving them away from others could be useful. We really want players to have a lot of options in how they deal with the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to also have a text chat in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Text chat, lobbies, friends. A lot of this stuff we've done in the past banner with Chivalry.</p>
<p><strong>Can you start a session of No More Room in Hell 2 with a full group of friends if you have enough of them?</strong></p>
<p>You start the game with 8 people, so it will always get filled to 8 people. The game is supposed to be quite difficult. The idea behind it is it's not easy to survive. Our game also has permadeath, which we're very excited about. We think a zombie apocalypse game and permadeath should go really hand in hand, so playing the game with anything less than 8 people to start would feel extremely tough, if not impossible, to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have bots filling the group whenever there aren't enough players to start a match?</strong></p>
<p>No, no, no. We think with 8 players, we should be fairly good. We have a lot of excitement around the game, which is awesome. So, there will be no bots in the game; it should just be humans.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'You start the game with 8 people, so it will always get filled to 8 people. The game is supposed to be quite difficult. The idea behind it is it's not easy to survive. I think internally, we're looking for characters that last three to five rounds. We want to normalize the death of characters. This is an apocalyptic game. What's really going to be fun is you could go back to the start and pick a brand new direction or character and then build out that one.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I'm guessing you pick your character before entering the game, correct? How do they differ from each other?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's very different, actually, from the first game. With permadeath, we also have a roguelike character system. When you get into the game for the first time, you're going to choose one of three characters, and those characters have special abilities. There are a ton of other characters; you're just going to see three options at first. As you go from round to round, if you level up after a game, you will have a roguelike mechanics where you can choose which direction you want to go with your character. As they grow, they're going to get better and stronger and faster, and then they're probably eventually going to die. I think internally, we're looking for characters that last three to five rounds.</p>
<p>We want to normalize the death of characters. This is an apocalyptic game. What's really going to be fun is you could go back to the start and pick a brand new direction or character and then build out that one. It's very unique for our game.</p>
<p><strong>With permadeath, players also want some kind of persistent progression to offset that constant loss of character progression.</strong></p>
<p>We have character progression and account progression. We're not talking a lot about account progression just yet, but yes, we don't want players to feel burned at the end of a character dying, right? You don't want them to feel like they've just lost everything. So we have the two. As your account progresses, you're going to get really interesting things from that. We're just not ready to talk about the specifics just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Did you announce the premium business model? Can you talk about the price point?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking at a roughly $30 price point for the game. It'll follow the business model of Chivalry, where we will be dropping more content throughout. It won't be dropped as DLC, it'll be dropped as just content to keep people coming back into the game. It's very important to us.</p>
<p>It's different from the first game, but we see a really strong value point in early access, around $30. The price would probably increase slightly from then to 1.0, but roughly $10 more.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on how long it will take from early access to 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>We don't want to spend more than a year in early access, so that would be the maximum amount of time. We plan on dropping a fair bit of content in that year. Gameplay features, weapons, zombie types, and maybe a map. We really want that early access period to be a period of content.</p>
<p><strong>What about console plans for No More Room in Hell 2?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing to announce on consoles just yet, but we want the game to be in as many hands as possible. For early access, it's all streamlined towards PC, but thanks to Chivalry, we have a really great relationship with companies like Xbox. It's something that we're not announcing officially, we don't have a date for anything, we don't officially know if it's going to happen, but getting the game in as many hands as possible is extremely important to us.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We're really lucky, I think. In our group of developers, we have a lot of very, very technical people who go deep into what they can do with UE5, whether that's Nanite or the different lighting tools. There's just a lot of technical wizards who are making the most out of the engine.</p>
<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 games tend to be very beautiful, but they can also be quite demanding in terms of performance.</strong></p>
<p>We're working a lot on that currently. Optimization is starting to be the team's main focus, so it's definitely at the forefront of our minds. We want this game to run as smoothly as possible for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Are you going to do some kind of beta test before early access?</strong></p>
<p>We really wanted to. We wanted to do a demo here, but we thought about how much bandwidth and team cost it would take to invest in that. What we really want to do is make sure that our early access build is the best it can be, so the investment's going entirely to that.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned post-launch updates. What kind of content additions can people expect?</strong></p>
<p>A little bit of everything. Gameplay features. We have a couple that we can't talk about, but we're very, very excited about, the kind of core gameplay features that should have a really strong effect on how people play the game. The maps, weapons, zombie types, a little bit of everything. Cosmetics, eventually. The early access build doesn't have a cosmetic system, but that will be a part of the game later. Of course, nothing that you can purchase will be attached to gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>How long has No More Room in Hell 2 been in development?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's been in development for a very long time. The Lever Game studio technically started working on this game in 2014, so 10 years of development, but it's been at Torn Banner now for just about two years. The game took a huge growth spurt when Torn Banner purchased it. It went from a bunch of people working on the game on their side time to a studio of 150 developers, mostly currently working on No More Room in Hell 2. It's been two years of production at Torn Banner, during which the game had this huge growth.</p>
<p><strong>I guess that means Chivalry 2 is no longer getting new content in the future.</strong></p>
<p>We announced that the last update was our last content update. We want the game to last as long as possible, so we will have patch updates and bug fixes. But other than that, Chivalry 2 is currently in a sort of soft sunset.</p>
<p><strong>Chivalry 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/chivalry-2-interview-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched as an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC</a>, but the same won't apply to No More Room in Hell 2. Can you talk about this difference?</strong></p>
<p>I think the Epic Games Store decision worked well for Chivalry 2, but with maybe the added context of the amount of players that play No More Room in Hell 1 and the amount of people that are waiting for this game, I think for us it was crucial to get this into as many hands as we can as possible from early access.</p>
<p><strong>Since the first game was basically a mod, will you support mods for this one?</strong></p>
<p>Not at the early access launch, as we're really focusing on the base game. It's not something that's in production currently. That is not to say that it would never happen, but nothing's on the plans just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Nexon, the studio behind the popular indie title Dave The Diver has announced that it has made a “small number” of layoffs to staff in its American offices.</p>



<p>According to the company, in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nexon-america-is-making-layoffs-to-pursue-exciting-ip-growth-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> (GD), the layoffs are part of a company “reorganization plan that will enable the formation of a new Western Development Group”. It all comes as a part of their new “long-term IP growth strategy”.</p>







<p>“A key element of the initiative is hyperlocalization–a strategy for hiring teams to adapt our games to match the tastes of local players in large markets like Europe and North Americ,” the statement provided to GD reads. “A big step in this process is the establishment of the Western Development Group here in Los Angeles, led by Nexon veteran Hanbyeol Oh.”</p>



<p>They continued, “Unfortunately, the re-organization includes the elimination of a small number of roles, with severance offered to those leaving. However, Nexon America is now hiring to fill out the new development team, including engineers and designers. It’s an exciting time at Nexon America and we look forward to sharing more on our plan.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nexon for clarification on the layoffs, including the number of employees being let go. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known jobs</a> lost in 2024 within the gaming industry. That’s over 2,000 more so far than the roughly 10,500 jobs lost in 2023. </p>

                <p>Gaming companies haven't exactly been shy about putting ads in games before, but Sony is now changing how they work on the PS5 dashboard. What was once the home of beautiful game art now has ads directly integrated into the user interface on the dashboard, and there doesn't seem to be any way to disable the ads short of unplugging the PS5 from the internet.</p><p>The ads appear to be linked to the official news feed for the games in question. For example, when the latest Spider-Man game was pulled up at the GameSpot office, the ad that came up was for a roundtable video featuring the creative team of Spider-Man 2 and and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

                <p dir="ltr">Bethesda has launched a substantial new update for Starfield today, coinciding with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/starfield-shattered-space-official-launch-trailer/2300-6465253/">Shattered Space</a>, the game's first paid expansion. The expansion costs $30 (or $27 with a Game Pass subscription), and it arrives alongside a free patch that offers a variety of improvements and fixes for all players, regardless of whether they purchase the DLC. Bethesda provided a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1840775449514815736" rel="nofollow ">detailed list of changes included in the update</a>, as well as <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/7fHSb8gfxJEE9UZLBkfKWg/prepare-for-the-launch-of-shattered-space">the expansion content</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Shattered Space introduces new quests, weapons, and items, and allows players to explore Va'Ruun’kai, home to the followers of the Great Serpent. Major sections of this world have been handcrafted, and the expansion includes survival-horror elements, with new enemies described as "stalking abominations." Bethesda compares this expansion to previous add-ons for its Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, offering a contained story with distinct mechanics and new gameplay options.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1l54t9VcTM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1l54t9VcTM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The update also addresses multiple issues reported by players. Version 1.14.70 includes tweaks to several problematic quests, adjustments to the REV-8 land vehicle introduced in the previous update, and improvements to the ship-building system. Other fixes target the game's user interface and audio. Bethesda also released PC specifications for Shattered Space, outlining the minimum and recommended requirements to ensure the expansion runs smoothly.</p><p><span>For more, check out </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-starfield-dlc-shattered-space/1100-6526794/">our guide on how to start the Shattered Space DLC</a><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us, a game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-is-an-unreal-engine-5-action-adventure-game-due-next-year/">announced during Sony's State of Play</a> in September, has just gotten a new 15-minute extended gameplay video uploaded to YouTube via the Nacon channel. Hell is Us is shaping up to be an action-adventure game which takes place in a war-torn country, where players have to go on an investigative journey to unravel the mysteries of their past as well as work towards confronting the human darkness that continues to fuel the chaos. This gameplay showcase features Jonathan Jacques-Belletete, the Creative Director and Art Director at Rogue Factor.&nbsp; Jacques-Belletete has a great portfolio, as he is known for working on Deus Ex: Human Revolution as the Art Director. He is now taking his next steps into being the Creative Director and Art Director for Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us is set to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620730/Hell_is_Us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. At the moment, there is no specific release date, except knowing that it's due next year. The footage uploaded to the Nacon YouTube channel showcases some of the fast-paced action and combat that players can expect from the game.</p>
<p>Jacques-Belletete begins to showcase the Alpha footage and says that it's a "take back to games from the 1990s," with the team being a bunch of passionate people with over 20 years of development experience.&nbsp; "We have a lot of love for how games from the 90s were played. There was no hand-holding, no silver plattering; you had to figure it out for yourself."</p>
<p>He goes on to say that those crucial features in games from the '90s are what they are trying to emulate in Hell is Us, and he wants the players to be in charge of their own discoveries rather than being pushed toward them.&nbsp; Jacques-Belletete then goes on to explain the protagonist is named Remi and was originally born in a war-torn country. However, his mother smuggled him out of the country when he was five, and he grew up in the foster system in Canada.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us | Extended Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q69e1A3ovxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game starts with players infiltrating the war-torn country, and Remi only remembers his village and his father being the blacksmith of the village. In the gameplay, a lot of the exploration is showcased, and it shows Remi walking through grungy, run-down environments and gathering items along the way. Exploring the country, you have to begin your journey to try and find your way back to your hometown, and get clues along the way from interactable items as well as characters you meet along the way.</p>
<p>Hell is Us features puzzles that will require solving in order to progress through the game. Compared to some modern games like God of War, Hell is Us won't feature any "artificial ways that will help him or tell him what to do," and players will have to rely completely on their surroundings, knowledge and puzzle-solving skills to progress through the game.</p>
<p>As the Soulslike genre continues to grow and become saturated, Jacques-Belletete makes it clear that Hell is Us "is not a Soulslike, and is more of a mid-core game. It's have fun, get in it, hack and slash." Although it's hack and slash with fun in mind, he does state that it's not easy, but it's also not overwhelmingly difficult, providing the right amount of challenge for the players, as combat is an integral part of Hell is Us.</p>
<p>The video goes on to explain the intricacies of combat, as well as exploration and puzzles, as they are the three main features that players will rely on throughout Hell is Us to be able to find their way back to their hometown and get the answers they need.</p>

Wild-eyed stickman brawler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a> appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

<p>
The island itself is one of those "living, breathing" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open worlds</a>. Perhaps more "disquietingly animate" than "living, breathing": some of the residents are ghosts. There are towns you can visit for clues where you'll receive quests, and there's a Morrowindy emphasis on exploring without the aid of modern UI fixtures - no questlog and no magic wayfaring compass. 
</p>
<p>
Guards and merchants have schedules and you can steal from shops, at the cost of not being able to buy that item in future. Combat is real-time with a pause when your action bar fills up, as in the elder Final Fantasies. Party member stats may unlock unique choices in dialogue, together with evolving relationships. It's certainly piling on the features - I've scraped the merest palmful from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3172700/Banquet_for_Fools/">the squirmingly loquacious Steam page</a> - but what I'm most here for is the haunted Plasticene art direction, which reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JugGmkvhsKQ">that Keane video about beds</a>.
</p>
<p>
Also of great interest to me: the odder abilities and the magic system, which appear to lean into the pagan premise. Singing and music are weaponisable in Banquet For Fools: you can get hold of some shepherd pipes that can summon angry ravens, for example. You can also learn new spell components from special trees, and assemble them into a custom enchantment by etching runes in blood using the mouse cursor. Not sure if there's any character HP loss involved, but there should be. In place of the traditional magical elements or classes, meanwhile, Banquet For Fools gives you "Fauna", "Vines" and "Spores". 
</p>
<p>
I must confess, I wouldn't know what paganism really looks like if it formed a torchlit procession to my doorstep and dropped a menhir on my head. I suspect I'm in danger of succumbing to caricatures of paganism as being squalid and fecund and excitingly gross. But I approve of the muckiness of Banquet For Fools, and welcome more games in this vein. 
</p>
<p>
The game will be in early access for around 8-10 months, according to the Steam blurb. "Banquet for Fools is feature complete, we're working on maps and content for the game over this autumn and winter," the developers write. "We're essentially done with all the hard parts and only have content to work on, and thought it would be a good time to open it up for ruleset suggestions and feedback for balancing out your gameplay. It's a single player experience so we're not too worried about over-balancing, but want all play styles to have challenges and areas of success." 
</p>
<p>
Possibly a good time to pounce on that demo. If you enjoy the aesthetic, you might also like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvedik</a>.

			<p>SEGA and developer Sports Interactive have announced Football Manager 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS, and Android. It will officially launch on November 26, 2024. The game will have a slightly different title for each platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Football Manager 25 will be on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass</li>
<li>Football Manager 25 Console will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC via Microsoft Store and <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-xbox-game-pass-positive-football-manager-head-says/">Xbox Game Pass</a></li>
<li>Football Manager 25 Mobile will be available on iOS and Android as a Netflix-exclusive</li>
<li>Football Manager 25 Touch will be available on Nintendo Switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those who are eager to snag this game, Football Manager 25 pre-orders are now available. Those who pre-order it for PC will get a 10% discount. At the moment, the console version's pre-orders are not open and will open up at a later date. For those who played Football Manager 2024, the save data from that game can be carried over to Football Manager 25.</p>
<p>Football Manager 25 is set to be a rule-breaker in the franchise. Players will be able to compete in the world's biggest league or try to accomplish new victories in Women's Football, which is a first for the franchise. Women's Football will seamlessly join the new game, with both having the same ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now that there are both men and women on the playing field, Football Manager 25 has more playable leagues and nations than ever, and features the biggest player database in football gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new iteration in the franchise has swapped over to the Unity Engine after previously using the match Engine for Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023. In a previous statement regarding Football Manager 2024, Miles Jacobson stated that it'd be the "last of its kind," with many fans of the franchise speculating that the franchise was ending.</p>
<p>However, now that it's been confirmed that they are swapping over to Unity Engine as well as adding Women's Football to the game, it's clearer than ever what they meant by that statement, as this is game-changing for the Football Manager franchise, especially after 20 years of the franchise.</p>
<p>Those who plan on picking up the new game will get to experience a new, smarter user interface which provides key info, as well as real-life volumetric player animations and enhanced graphical fidelity to give players the most realistic experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate the announcement of Football Manager 25, there is now an Announce Trailer showcasing the new era of the franchise.</p>

But Harada’s personal “dream” character of Colonel Sanders has yet to make an appearance—and based on how his meeting with KFC went, it seems like the fried chicken empire’s mascot will never trade blows with Heihachi Mishima or Kuma. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with <em>The Gamer</em></a></span>, Harada explained that “a long time ago” he wanted to do a KFC x <em>Tekken </em>crossover, saying: “I wanted to have Colonel Sanders from Kentucky Fried Chicken fight.

As for getting a Waffle House stage, something Tekken fans have jokingly asked about in the past, Harada said “It’s not something that we can accomplish on our own.” Waffle House would have to agree and seeing how KFC reacted, I’m not sure it will happen. </p><h2 id="h4397"><a id=""></a>Harada has wanted a KFC x <em>Tekken</em> crossover for years</h2><p>Harada talked about getting Colonel Sanders in <em>Tekken</em> before.

Lucky for you, the Enter the Mysterium bundle actually gives you several different ways to experience the seminal puzzle game. If you played this year’s Riven then you might be inclined to play 2020’s <em>Myst </em>remake, as it also updates the original game with beautiful graphics and free-movement throughout the world. To get something closer to classic <em>Myst </em>you can play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/myst-masterpiece-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/myst-masterpiece-edition"><em>Myst: Masterpiece Edition</em></a></span>, which retains the point-and-click movement and low-fi aesthetics of the 1993 original. The third and final version of the game available in the bundle, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672"><em>realMyst: Masterpiece Edition</em></a></span>, lies somewhere in between the other two, offering 3D movement that makes traversing the world easier in addition to updated graphics (at least by 2014 standards) that still feel in line with the original release’s artstyle. Each game has its pros and cons depending on the type of experience you are looking for, but every one retains the impressive atmosphere and challenging puzzles of the original, so you can’t really go wrong.</p><p>Beyond <em>Myst </em>and <em>Riven</em>, there are three more games in the series. Those are—in order—<em>Exile</em>, <em>Revelation</em>, and <em>End of Ages</em>. While the puzzle-solving aspect of the <em>Myst </em>series loses some of its charm when you play titles back to back, it makes up for it with a sprawling narrative with twists and turns. It’s a story about ambition, betrayals, and family intrigue.</p><p>But the bundle isn’t just about <em>Myst </em>and its sequels. There are also a number of other titles from developer Cyan Inc. in the bundle worth checking out. Specifically, <em>Firmament </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672"><em>Obduction</em></a></span><em> </em>are fascinating because of how they iterate on the genre’s formula, with a timeless otherworldly feel and new types of puzzles for players to figure out. In total, the bundle gets you 13 games for $25 as well as a coupon for this year’s <em>Riven </em>remake, if you haven’t played it already. For hours of puzzle-solving fun, that price is an absolute bargain worth taking advantage of </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hideo Kojima says that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is only about “30%-40%” complete. </p>



<p>In an appearance at Tokyo Game Show, Kojima talked about the franchise, including where things stand with the upcoming sequel. He told the gathered crowd that the game isn’t halfway done, but didn’t show much concern about it.</p>

<p>He then reiterated that the game will still release in 2025 as planned.</p>



<p>“I haven’t said the release date today, but the release date has already been decided, and I’m currently working on it in preparation for that,” he said</p>



<p>He added that while the date will be announced next year, “unforeseen circumstances” prevent them from revealing it sooner.</p>

			<p>If a Final Fantasy IX remake would ever get developed, it would likely be a multi-title project like the Final Fantasy VII Remake project, according to Naoki Yoshida.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Games</a> about which entry in the series he would like to remake, the Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer said that, among the classic entries in the series, he would like to remake the third game, originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan back in 1990. He also acknowledged the demand for a Final Fantasy IX remake, adding that it would be difficult to create as the huge "volume" of the original makes him wonder if it's possible to remake the entire game in a single title.</p>
<p>This statement is rather interesting, considering there's a huge possibility that a Final Fantasy IX remake could indeed be in the works. Originally leaked via the huge GeForce NOW leak from a few years back, which correctly revealed multiple Square Enix releases before their official announcement, this <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-ready-release-prettier/">unannounced remake</a> is supposedly rather faithful to the original, and not as ambition as the aforementioned Final Fantasy VII Remake project. However, as the years have gone by without a reveal, it is entire possible Square Enix canned the project or rebooted it as a more ambitious project that could require multiple entries as Yoshi-P said, although with the disappointing performance on the market of the latest entries in the series, it is unlikely Square Enix would commit to such a massive project.</p>
<p>While an official remake has yet to be made, PC players can enjoy Final Fantasy IX with better visuals and additional features with the Moguri Mod. Version 9.0 released <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-moguri-mod-9-0-download/">last month</a>, introducing visual improvements and more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-text-chat-feature/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-is-getting-text-chat-but-not-how-you%E2%80%99d-imagine.996468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-text-chat-feature/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout 76 has been on the market since 2018, but for some reason, Bethesda Game Studios has always neglected to include a text-based chat in the game. There are local voice chat options, but that’s about it – which presents a considerable accessibility issue. That’s being addressed as we speak, with the game’s test server getting access to a new text-based solution.</p>



<p>That’s where the catch sits – it’s tied to accessibility. It’s a text-to-speech or a speech-to-text function designed to aid gamers who can’t use their voice to communicate, or those who have impaired vision.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-progress">It’s Progress</h2>



<p>In the ‘PTS’, players are discovering the option to turn on text-to-speech and speech-to-text mechanics.</p>



<p>If you’re a Fallout 76 player, you might have run into a need to use text chat to communicate with other users over the years, but you’ll have been met with a brick wall as the function simply never existed. That’s set to change.</p>



<p>It works as you’d imagine. If you type something into the text box (accessible on PC by pressing ‘.’) you’ll hear an AI-powered voice speaking your words to anyone close enough to hear them. Similarly, any users speaking close by using traditional voice chat will have their words transcribed by AI and written into the text box.</p>



<p>In Fargassier’s video below, you can see that the function isn’t perfect. It doesn’t always catch what you’re saying very clearly and the AI voice isn’t the best, plus there are some concerns regarding filtering:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="We Tested Out Bethesda's New Text Chat In The PTS Of Fallout 76" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ndhk6IPRyYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s still a step in the right direction for Bethesda Game Studios. Even if it has taken this long to implement something relatively simple, it’s an extra consideration that ticks a huge accessibility box. It’ll need some tweaking before it’s perfect, but that’s the point of the Fallout 76 PTS.</p>



<p>Many PC players have argued that there has been a mod live on Nexus for years that adds text chat to the game, but it’s not an ideal solution and you could run into a ToS infringement for running it.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this new feature making its way into Fallout 76? Let us know on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">the Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hell is Us: The First Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-is-us-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-the-first-preview.996465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-is-us-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let’s get this one out of the way: Hell is Us isn’t a soulslike. Nor is it an open-world game. Instead, it aims to separate itself from other action adventures by emphasising investigation and discovery, ushering you to get lost in its weirdness. That’s exactly what happened to me during my two-hour hands-on with developer Rogue Factor’s latest, an arresting mixture of medieval and sci-fi aesthetics set against a 90s European civil war backdrop. I enjoyed its approach to tense melee combat encounters and information-gathering puzzles, but what excites me the most is what I don’t know – where its intriguing story will lead me next.</p><p>Hell is Us is one of the bleaker games I’ve played in a while. Upon entering a village surrounded by muddy marshland, I’m greeted by a mass grave, bodies hanging from a tree, and the yearnful strings of a local’s violins. You’ll become used to such scenes during the early hours of venturing through the fictional European nation of Hadea, circa an alternate 1990s. It’s a country ravaged by civil war that has cut itself off from the rest of the world, and the place that main character Rémi fled as a child. Fast forward years later and he’s back in his homeland having smuggled himself over the border in search of the parents who sent him off for a better life.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Hell is Us: Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The first step of the mystery brings me to a lonely farmhouse, the basement of which the owner now calls home. Through conversation about my father and the larger conflict at play, I’m able to pull on a thread that eventually reveals the village of Jova as his last known location. Hell is Us wants you to take your time talking to people and investigating every avenue of conversation. Indeed, being a wandering detective appears to be as much a part of its gameplay as its punishing combat (more on that in a bit). It forces you to observe its world and the people trapped in it. You are deprived of map markers, waypoints, and – thanks to that 90s setting – a mobile phone. Instead of those tools, you are reliant on directions and clues given by mouth or read on scattered notes.</p><p>In order to reach Jova I’ll need a vehicle, and it just so happens that a military APC is parked nearby. Retrieving its engine’s lost key appears a simple fetch quest at first, but Hell is Us’ emphasis on investigation means this task quickly reveals itself to be a much more complex problem. I talk to a wounded soldier who gives me rough directions through a forest, which in turn leads me to a puzzle where I need to match symbols on a door using a contraption. The gateway unlocked, I then delve deep into the tomb inside. This is where things get weird.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Foes take the form of milky white humanoids that move slowly yet menacingly, echoing images from the finale of Annihilation.</p></div><p>During a conversation at gamescom 2024, creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête revealed to me the influence that Annihilation plays on Hell is Us. The team has been inspired not just by the visuals of Alex Garland’s striking 2018 film, but also the overall off-kilter tone of Jeff VanderMeer’s trilogy of novels it’s based on. It can be heard in the unsettling score that soundtracks Hadea, filled with droning, stuttering electronics and twinkling otherworldliness, but becomes much more evident when you’re face-to-face with enemies. </p><p>The basic foes take the form of milky white humanoids that move slowly yet menacingly, echoing images from the finale of Garland’s movie. Others are more developed quadrupeds that possess blades for limbs that slice at you if you get too close – I couldn’t help but think of the necromorphs that haunt Dead Space’s corridors when faced with them. But the horrors don’t end there. In fact, they’re hidden around every tight corner and in every open field. This is best exemplified near the end of my demo as I venture far too near a giant shimmering blob of spiking goo and wavy ribbing. It’s a hard thing to try and describe in words, and in turn quite unlike anything else I’ve ever seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So far it all sounds very sci-fi horror, but that’s just one side of Hell is Us’ coin, because the way you deal with these threats is thoroughly medieval fantasy. I quickly discover that standard weapons have no effect on them, but thankfully soon receive a glowing white sword that’s much more effective. Alongside a standard mix of dodging and blocking, you can slice at enemies with both standard and charged heavy attacks. At its core it's a relatively basic melee combat system that I found fairly unforgiving at times (though never unfair,) but more wrinkles do reveal themselves over time. Recovery items are scarce, so you’ll largely be relying on the smart “healing pulse” system, which is triggered by hitting the right bumper button when a burst of particles emerges from an enemy after hitting them. It encourages aggression when playing, and kept me on the front foot when searching for a health top-up, just as some of my favourite action-heavy games like Control and Doom Eternal do.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you can go in all blades blazing, however, as the length of your stamina bar is directly linked to the amount of health you have left. This means you can only get a hit or two in when near death before needing to hang back and rest a moment. Should you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can call upon your drone companion who, among other abilities, can distract enemies while you sneak up on them for a critical hit. This isn’t necessarily a stealth game, but it’s nice to know the option is there.</p><p>Alongside special attacks, these systems all combine to create a tense dance in each combat encounter that’s a consistent thrill to navigate through, especially when faced with more complex threats. A prime example of such foes are those connected to glowing, pulsating entities that are colour-coded depending on the type of attack they use. For example, the red ones plow into you, whereas the yellow ones attack from range. Deal enough damage to them and they’ll retreat into their fleshier counterparts and make them vulnerable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>During my playtime, I also got my hands on several other weapons, too, such as a very cool pair of twin axes that unleashed flurries of charged attacks, and a hulking polearm that delivered slow but heavy hits. The latter seemed an entirely optional find, too, unlocked by collecting a series of ancient medallions and slotting them into a side door hidden in the catacombs. It’s nice to see the investigation side of the game leading to new treasures and cleverly integrated into these open zone areas, rather than just being there to reveal story information.</p><p>Of course, this combat is what stands between Rémi and him being reunited with his father. That connection will remain lost for the time being, however, as upon arriving in Jova it is revealed that he left town with the global peacekeeping forces. The journey continues and the next stage of the investigation is underway as I wander around speaking to weary, sometimes dismissive, villagers. There’s obviously some deeper mystery at play too, as alien languages and arresting sci-fi gothic architecture lurk underground, waiting to emerge and reveal their secrets. It’s worth noting that Hell is Us is striking throughout, no coincidence when you consider Jacques-Belletête was an art director of both Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided - two games that have stood the test of time incredibly well from a stylistic perspective.</p><p>It’s this willingness to just get a bit weird that makes me so encouraged by what I’ve played of Hell is Us. Its 90s setting and appropriate lack of modern technology is not only a vehicle to encourage genuine exploration, but also feels like a throwback to a decade where games held your hand a little more loosely. I, for one, welcome it, and look forward to seeing where Hell is Us leads me to next.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy is also up for wallowing in bleakness.

                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 were instant hits in the later days of the PlayStation 1, with Pro Skater 3 becoming an even bigger hit on the PlayStation 2 and considered one of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console's best game</a>. It's only been four years since the last Tony Hawk Pro Skater release, and the man himself confirmed on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> that more are on the way.</p><p>"The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was released exactly 25 years ago today," Hawk posted. "My intention and expectation for the game was mostly for the enjoyment of skateboarders. I had no idea it would transcend a niche market to become a massive success and--as some have argued--change the course of skateboarding's popularity (and possibly even skate trick evolution)."</p><p>Pro Skater's popularity helped usher in a slew of similar titles for different sports like snowboarding with the SSX series, and professional snowboarder Shaun White led with his own gaming series for the sport as well.</p><p>Hawk's post continued with how the game changed his life and introduced him to a generation of fans outside the normal X-Games crowd.</p><p>"[The game] is a big reason that I get to ride my skateboard for a living to this very day. And most of the featured characters are still out there ripping and representing skateboarding’s diversity in the best ways possible."</p><p>In the post, Hawk had some footage of him performing moves for the mocap for the game in the development phase. "I poured myself into every aspect of this project because I believed we were creating something exceptional, and I am immensely proud of the series that followed…and their soundtracks," he added. "Thanks to Activision, Neversoft (RIP) and all of you that played THPS in those formative years. I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p><p>In 2020, Pro Skater 1 and 2 were remade with modern graphics and released as a single game, making it the first major console game in the series since 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. In addition to the Pro Skater games, the series also included other skateboarding titles like Underground, Shred, Ride, American Wasteland, Project 8, Motion, and Downhill Jam.</p><p>After Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 release, there was reportedly a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">second remake in the works</a> for Pro Skater 3 and 4 from developer Vicarious Visions. These plans were nixed in favor of the developer working as a Call of Duty support studio.

<p>Developer Sports Interactive says it's been a "record-breaking year" for the football sim, with "more than 14m players" across all platforms, with a switch to Unity marking the "biggest technical and visual advancement for the series in generation".</p>
<p>The new teaser embedded above doesn't offer much in the way of gameplay footage, unfortunately, but the 2025 iteration will boast revamped UI, women's football, enhanced graphical fidelity, and "new volumetric player animations taken from real football matches".</p>
<p>SI says to "keep an eye" on it social channels as more details will come soon. Pre-order now, (albeit only available on PC/Mac for now; PS5 and Xbox pre-orders will launch "at a later date") and you'll secure a 10 percent discount. Don't forget that Football Manager 25 Mobile is scheduled to launch on the same day exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>, too.</p>

Sadistic even. Without doubt it has proven to be one of the most challenging, most arduous, most masochistic video game experiences of my life. Thrilling in places, deeply frustrating in others, I certainly didn’t enjoy every moment of it, but what I can say is that I survived it and was immensely satisfied in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - Mask of Darkness |DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVZirQWSlD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For all those who didn’t find the brilliant Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown challenging enough – what is wrong with you? That last boss almost broke me – then the Mask of Darkness DLC is undoubtedly for you. Accessible from a few hours into the main game, this DLC takes the form of an optional side quest. Sargon is tasked with hunting down the mysterious masked Immortal Radjen. Unfortunately, our hapless hero is tricked and ends up trapped in Radjen’s mind palace, an entirely separate map, cut off from the labyrinthian environment of Mount Qaf that we have all grown so familiar with.</p>


<p>The player is immediately stripped of the majority of Sargon’s abilities and health boosts. Essentially, you end up with the bog-standard vanilla version of the protagonist. Two exceptions remain: a dash and the teleport. It took some time to adjust to not having a double jump anymore; Sargon plunging to his death on more occasions than I care to recount due to my muscle memory kicking in. On the plus side, entirely new amulets can be found and returned with to the main game. One notable example, with which your Chakram is turned into a vampire, absorbing health from enemies to return to the player, is an unbelievably handy addition.</p>


<p>With Sargon thoroughly debuffed, what follows is one of the most brutal, yet finely honed, platforming challenges I’ve ever encountered. From the first stretch, where Sargon is chased by a giant evil eye that will instant kill him on contact, this DLC is clearly a very different beast from the original game. You should prepare to die. A lot. The precision platforming required can often feel overwhelming, yet, due to the thorough and immaculate design work, there is always a way through. A way that often surprises you with its ease to implement once you see it. Yet, before that, there is a lot of trial and error – particularly when it comes to those irritating platforms that only disappear after you leave their surface – and that certainly won’t be to everyone’s taste.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, Radjen’s mind palace stands out from the varied biomes of Mount Qaf. This is a far darker, eminently sinister, environment. One with huge symbiote-like tendrils infecting it, twisting and suffocating each vast landscape you encounter. There are some new baddies to bash, of course. Most enjoyable are the mechanical spinning blade drones that you can deflect into the unsuspecting faces of other foes, most satisfying indeed.<br>
</p>
<p>There are also supposedly four bosses to be killed by, though that number is rather disingenuous, as one of the four is little more than a powered-up regular warrior with a life bar. Radjen though, proves to offer a phenomenal, if disparagingly difficult, final challenge. One which will test your reflexes like nothing else in the main game. You also unlock a further boss battle upon completion of the mind Palace. Suffice to say it’s a great ultimate smackdown against an old mentor.</p>
<p>Despite the hugely difficult challenge that Mark of Darkness offers, it is entirely doable thanks to Ubisoft’s generous suite of accessibility options. Nearly ever facet of the game can be tinkered with. From being able to summon portals to instantly navigate nasty platforming sections or by reducing enemy attack damage to virtually nothing. So effective are these gameplay easers, that even this aged and slightly inept gamer was able to see things through to completion.</p>
<p>For under a fiver and with around five to six hours of content, the Mask of Darkness is practically an essential addition for fans of The Lost Crown. Offering an intense experience; as well as a surprisingly compelling story that fills in many of the blanks from the original game. Recommended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni have announced that Assetto Corsa EVO will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Early Access</a> as of January 16, 2025. This game is the latest evolution in the iconic Assetto Corsa series and is said to represent a major leap forward in the universe by offering a "significantly enriched sim-racing experience."&nbsp; Much like previous games in the franchise, Assetto Corsa EVO will include cars from different classes, showcasing years of motoring history. These cars will include road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars.</p>
<p>Using KUNOS Simulazioni's new proprietary engine, the feeling of driving these cars in-game will be able to more accurately simulate the mechanical, electronic and aerodynamic feel of driving a car at high speeds, helping to provide a new sense of realism to the franchise.</p>
<p>This game in particular will be supporting a full 24-hr race cycle, with new cutting-edge lighting, dynamic weather, track conditions and photorealistic visuals, which are all boosted using the new engine created by KUNOS.</p>
<p>"We know you've been eagerly awaiting news on Assetto Corsa EVO launch and trust us<em> —&nbsp;</em>we've been working hard to make sure everything meets our high standards. Here at KUNOS, we believe in taking the time to get things just right, and that's why the Early Access for Assetto Corsa EVO will officially begin on January 16, 2025," said Marco Massarutto, KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder and Executive Manager.</p>
<p>To support the news of Assetto Corsa EVO's Early Access launch, the developers released a new trailer, which features in-game footage for the first time. The trailer is just under two minutes long, and it credits companies such as Porsche, Alfa Romeo, Rseat, and Bell Helmets in the description, as they are partnered up with KUNOS Simulazioni to be able to create Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there is no price given for how much Assetto Corsa EVO will cost when it launches, but based off of previous launches of games in the Assetto Corsa franchise, it's expected it'll be around the 40 to 50 dollar mark, but that could be subject to change, especially once the game leaves Early Access. It isn't stated how long they are planning on the game being in Early Access, but hopefully, the feedback during that time will be beneficial in giving players the best sim-racing experience.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a sale on the<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-added-to-assetto-corsa-thanks-to-csp-mod/"> Assetto Corsa</a> games across multiple platforms, including all of the DLCs for the games. Assetto Corsa Competizione, the most recent game to be released on Steam in the franchise is currently available for $11.99, which is a huge 70% discount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sabotage Studio has announced the release date for the upcoming free&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>Dawn of Equinox update, which is bringing three-player local co-op, new combat systems, and more.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the update, which lands on November 12th across all platforms, is distinct from the game's upcoming free&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>DLC, which we got to learn about during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct shows</a>.</p>
<p>Like that DLC, however, this update is completely free. The first major feature it's bringing is local three-player co-op, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-darling-rpg-sea-of-stars-achieves-5-million-players-couch-co-op-revealed">first revealed for the game back in March</a> (when we also learned&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>had hit the five million player count).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-combat.jpg?itok=x3knLc99 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-combat.jpg?itok=y2SR2Oed 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>will soon support three-player co-op.</figcaption></figure><p>The new multiplayer mode will not only let you traverse the world with your friends, but will also introduce a new Co-op Timed Hits mechanic, which will need you and your friends to be on your toes in combat.</p>
<p>As well as multiplayer, you're also getting new Mystery Locks in combat, which will need to be revealed in order to figure out which abilities you should use against certain foes. Combo Points will no longer be lost after battle, either, allowing you to experiment with new ways to approach different encounters.</p>
<p><em>Sea of Stars</em>' prologue has been revamped as well; it no longer plays out in flashback, instead opening directly on the heroes' childhood in order to get you into the action more quickly.</p>
<p>A number of other new features have also been included as part of the Dawn of Equinox update, including new difficulty presets, improvements to the Parrot relic, and a bonus cinematic to "accentuate a pivotal moment in the original adventure".</p>

<p><em>Sea of Stars</em>' Dawn of Equinox update arrives ahead of&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em>, a free DLC intended for release in 2025. Said DLC will add a new playable character, a new storyline, and more, and is intended to serve as an "encore" to the original game.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244090/Sea_of_Stars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sea-of-stars/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sea-of-stars/9NLLTTJZH40L" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sea-of-stars-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>The long-running chief of the Tekken series, Katsuhiro Harada, once tried to convince KFC to let him use Colonel Sanders as a character in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a>, according to an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/">TheGamer</a>. "[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."</p>
<p>Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>.</p>

<p>The wide-eyed mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3TENrrlOyw">no stranger to violence</a>. He is agile, powerful, and fully media trained. There really is no reason why this could not happen.</p>

<p>Ah, but which incarnation of the bleach-but-not-blond hero would best fit the Tekken mould? The modern CGI gym bro in orange spandex is the obvious choice, since it fits in with the game's narrow range of body types. But the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tquSbZEP-g">boxer-wearing beanpole of the 1990s</a> may offer variety. Yes, the Mr Muscle of today is a reboot. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe but for toilet cleaner.  </p>
<h2>The Annoying Singer From The Go Compare Ads</h2>

<p>In lieu of oversized biffer Bob, this may be a good fit. He is appropriately zany, kooky, <em>and</em> wacky. He can sing his jingle at the start and end of every fight, earning Bandai Namco literally dozens of British pounds in advertising revenue. What's not to like?</p>
<h2>The Monopoly Man</h2>

<p>Her laugh will make an excellent mid-game taunt, and her fondness for showing off her earrings (cheese) puts her firmly into the Tekken developer's archetypal realm of "women wot punch and like fashion". Her bovine body may prove a challenge. But this is a series that has had a bear, a dinosaur, a kangaroo, and another, smaller dinosaur. I'm sure they can manage. </p>

<p>Lots of room for puns in the post-game gloat with this guy. "I'm going to batter you!" or "I can weather any wave-dash!" or "King of the Iron <em>Fish</em> Tournament? That's me!" He could have a farcical side story with Kuma, all about the Captain's salmon stock going missing. Oh, Kuma! You big silly, greedy bear.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kimberly-Clark</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>A literal underdog, the Andrex Puppy would need to be redesigned from the ground up to be viable in the meta. A ranged attack where he throws endless rolls of shit tickets at opponents. Several powerful unblockable charge attacks. This is all surely achievable from a legal and corporate perspective. Surely. </p>

<p>Hang on a minute... Julius!? This guy has a name and it is <em>Julius</em>? Also, hey! This is just the Monopoly man's younger brother! That family's got their fingers in everything. Disgusting. Another condemnation of capitalism's salty, powdery excess. I'm done with this stupid list.</p>
