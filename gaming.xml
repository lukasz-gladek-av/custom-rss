			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I had the amazing opportunity to speak with veteran developer Tim Willits about Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, Saber Interactive, and the industry as a whole. Willits worked at id Software for 24 years, eventually becoming Studio Director. He left the Texan developer in July 2019 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-id-software-studio-director-tim-willits-joins-saber-interactive-as-chief-creative-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became</a> Chief Creative Officer at Saber Interactive only about a month later.</p>
<p>Of course, the main focus of our chat was the impending launch of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 (due on September 9, with a full year of post-launch roadmap already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>), but we also discussed ongoing issues within the industry and how Saber is tackling those challenges. Keep scrolling to read a very interesting conversation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - The Angels Of Death" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buT5yuGwg8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>With Space Marine 2, you are taking a beloved game and finally making a sequel around a decade later. Are you feeling the pressure of the fans?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Warhammer 40K franchise has been around for 45 years now, and millions of people love the franchise in itself. The first game was very popular. But I also want to say that if you, as a fan or as an action gamer, have never played the first game, don't worry about that. You can start with Space Marine 2 and it's a complete game. It's actually difficult to play the first game now because it's only on Steam.</p>
<p>There is an expectation from Warhammer 40K fans that we treat the universe with respect and that we get things correct. Then there's an expectation from fans of the first game, as well as just fans of Saber and action games. So yes, the expectations are very high, but I believe that we have a game that will exceed those expectations. We have a very dense game with a campaign mode that you can play by yourself or with two friends. We have our PvE missions where the story kind of runs parallel to the campaign, and then we have a full 6v6 PvP mode with three game modes, so it's a lot to offer. It's all wrapped together in our Saber proprietary technology with the Swarm tech and AI director, so we believe we are delivering the true ultimate Space Marine experience.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take to make this game?</strong></p>
<p>Games always take a long time nowadays. About four years or so in this case, but we're very proud of where it is now. We're very happy with our work, and the people who played the preview were happy. Preorders are great. Right now, what we're focused on is September 9, you know, making sure that the servers are up and running for everyone, making sure that any issues are ironed up, but everything's looking good; it's all green lights. The game is fun and solid, so yeah, I'm excited about the launch.</p>
<p><strong>I believe the game was originally meant to come out in late 2023. Can you share what were the reasons behind this nine-month delay and what did you improve during this additional time?</strong></p>
<p>We just needed more time to polish it. You know that old saying a game is only late until it ships, but a bad game is bad forever. We wanted to focus on making sure that every component, the single player campaign and the PvE co-op mode, all those were solid.</p>
<p>There's a lot to this game and I feel that players will feel good regarding value and content. When you have all those systems, you have progression, and you have multiplayer, sometimes things take longer to get right, but I'm glad that we took the time we needed to make sure that we got it correct because Warhammer 40K fans want it correct. If we screwed something up, they would be mad, you know, and so we really wanted to honor the franchise, we wanted to respect the universe, and we wanted to make the game that people want to play.</p>
<p><strong>You worked closely with Games Workshop, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they were a great partner. Everything had to be approved, from a small insignia to iconography, dialogue, etc. But they were great to work with and helped us every step of the way, so it was a real partnership.</p>
<p><strong>I guess that includes the storyline.</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. Our storyline with Titus - did you play the original?</p>
<p><strong>Not much.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, which is fine because, again, like I said, you don't have to play the first one.</p>
<p><strong>I know Titus, the protagonist, was demoted at the end of the first game.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and then he spent 200 years in Deathwatch. This is kind of a fresh start for him, but we tried to add more personality and emotions into his story and his relationship with his squadmates and how they feel about him. He needs to win their trust while also saving the universe, so it is more than just a run-and-gun game. Titus's story is an important part of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Especially because nowadays gamers want more. They're not just fine with shooting, like in the days of the original DOOM.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It's important to note that the Warhammer 40K universe has been an inspiration for so many video games throughout the last decades. Just look at the original DOOM space marine; what does he look like? Look at the chain sword in Gears - where did that come from? Look at things like the Power Armor in Fallout. That looks a lot like a Space Marine. This IP has influenced many games, so I hope gamers who may be younger or may not understand the 40K universe can look at this and understand how effective it is.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the storyline, something I noticed while playing the preview is that one of Titus's squadmates is very confrontational with him.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Gadriel and Chairon. Yes, he gets a little whiny, and I want to punch him, but yes, he's like, "What is up with you?" There's an event in the game between Titus and him, but it is interesting to see how that plays out.</p>
<p><strong>Based on your estimates, how long is the campaign going to be?</strong></p>
<p>It took me 12 hours to complete it, but it all depends on how you play it, on the difficulty, whether you are with your human buddies or by yourself, etc.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have plans to add more classes to the multiplayer modes after launch.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The PvE co-op Operations mode basically continues the story of the campaign, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. When you play through the campaign, there are times when other Space Marine squads go off and do other important missions in the big storyline, so it's like there's one mission where you have to send a signal, and the defenses have to be knocked out, and you hear that there's a squad doing that. Well, when you play PvE Operations, you're that squad. The battle is so big and there's so much going on that we've engineered these co-op missions to fit into the story and make you feel part of the bigger conflict.</p>
<p><strong>I know you have a class system for the multiplayer modes. Can you talk about that?</strong></p>
<p>Indeed. Are you familiar with World War Z? It's a little similar. Our game director, Dmitry Grigorenko, was the Game Director on World War Z, and he's very good at progression, class identities, and attributes. As you play, even in PvE, as you progress, you unlock different classes and you can earn experience. You can use some of that experience to upgrade your characters even in PvP, so it's like World War Z, where you have things like the Assault class, the Heavy class, and the Support class. We have Warhammer 40K names for them, but you can pick one that you like that fits your style and then you can you can apply your experience to those classes.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. How deep is the progression for each class?</strong></p>
<p>It's deep. World War Z was deep. I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, but I feel that players will be happy. Like World War Z, we will have updates where we will expand classes, weapons, and game modes, all for free.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have plans to add new classes to Space Marine 2 post-launch?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have plans for it. There will be new stuff for everything.</p>
<p><strong>Is there some sort of randomness attached to the co-op mode to keep things interesting?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The game knows that you've played those missions before, and if you play them again, you can have different enemies, so you may play a mission, and then all of a sudden, Chaos Marines show up. We do add variety to that. It comes back to our AI Director, which is a key component in our <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Swarm_Engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swarm Engine</a>. We have the Swarm Deck, which controls the actions of the Swarms of Tyranids. When the Swarm breaks and each Tyranid starts to come at you, then the AI Director kicks in and it understands the state of the battles.</p>
<p>It can bring in heavies, and it can bring in ranged attack Tyranids. As a Space Marine, you are the ultimate killing machine. You are plowing through these Tyranids, but at some point, you start to feel overwhelmed, and you're fighting and fighting, and then you just finally make it through with barely enough armor left to survive.&nbsp;But you've done it, and that is all due to this very advanced AI director that helps kind of orchestrate those battles.</p>
<p><strong>Are the class skills in multiplayer the same across PvE and PvP, or did you balance them differently?</strong></p>
<p>There are similarities, but there are also differences because, obviously, fighting Chaos Marines is way more difficult than fighting Tyranids. There are behind-the-scenes changes and adjustments that allow for challenging yet approachable gameplay in PvP, as well as having fun with your buddies in PvE.</p>
<p><strong>When you're in PvE, it's okay to feel overpowered. In PvP, not so much.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. What's great about PvP is something I call the Dance of Death, where you can't just button mash; you gotta move. You have your blocks, you have your grabs, you have your counters, you have your fast melees, you have your long melees, and then you can have weapons. You need to keep moving and then attack, block, attack, so there is this Dance of Death that we've created in PvP.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Nothing has really changed since we returned independent. The great thing about Saber is there's me, Matthew, Andrey, and Anton. There's like four of us that make all the decisions. That was always the case. We've announced some other games we're working on, like Jurassic Park Survival, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, coming out in October, and&nbsp;Toxic Commando.&nbsp;We'll be talking about that soon after we launch Space Marine 2. Things are going well for us.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You're independent again, with Saber CEO Matthew Karch owning parent company Beacon Interactive after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split</a> with Embracer. How does it feel, and what changed?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing really. The great thing about Saber is there's me, Matthew, Andrey, and Anton. There's like four of us that make all the decisions. That was always the case before we were purchased by Embracer, even while we worked with Embracer, and now that we're independent again, it really hasn't changed much.</p>
<p>I'm focusing on the games. That's my job, making sure that each of the teams has what they need to make the best game they can. I jump in when I'm free. I'm not in the trenches like Dmitry, but I do have exposure to all the titles and work with the teams, which makes my job awesome, I love my job. But nothing's really changed. We work with Focus for Space Marine 2 and RoadCraft. <span>We've announced some other games we're working on, like Jurassic Park Survival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, coming out in October, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-is-a-co-op-fps-powered-by-sabers-swarm-engine-and-due-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toxic Commando</a>.</span>&nbsp;We'll be talking about that soon after we launch Space Marine 2. Things are going well for us.</p>
<p><strong>Are you maybe going to self-publish some titles, too?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We're self-publishing Jurassic Park Survival and A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, and we're also publishing third-party games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-announces-the-knightling-a-fantasy-action-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Knightling</a>. We own 3D Realms, so there are a number of titles that we publish.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, the industry was shaken by various events, like studio closures and mass layoffs. Some developers are quite pessimistic about the future. What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>I have seen all the cycles. I started in 1995, and I remember the death of consoles; I remember the death of the PC. I remember that, yes, there's always cycles, but good games and good teams will always be successful. One of the things that Saber has done well is that we have studios around the world and we focus on the right scopes for our games. We focus on the right deal for our games. Each of our studios has multiple projects, so we don't have 200 people sitting around waiting for pre-production to finish. We're very smart with our money, and we focus on the core aspects of the game. We focus on what's truly fun, whether it's a $5 million game, $10 million game, or $50 million; it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>But if that core game loop is not there, it's not going to be a success, and we've done well by managing our teams, having teams and around the world at different cost structures, and finding the most talented people. If you're a world-class artist, you don't need to be in California.</p>
<p><strong>I guess, like you said, perhaps the secret is really managing your budget really well. Because some game franchises have had their budgets balloon with certain sequels.</strong></p>
<p>Well, that's because some teams have, especially in North America, 150-200 people. They pay everyone well. If your burn rate is a couple of million dollars a month and you wanna change an idea three months later, that's like $6 million wasted. We can make a game for $6 million.</p>
<p>That's one of the problems, you got these huge teams working on one game. If they want to iterate, that's expensive. Each studio at Saber has a main team working on something, and it's a natural ramp, and we have people experimenting with ideas that are starting some really small projects. Maybe five people want to work on an idea, and they can change it, they iterate, they're not spending millions of dollars. As soon as that idea is solid and we're happy with it, after going through our evaluations and our gates, then we ship people over to that project.</p>
<p>We also have a culture at Saber where everyone can work on every project. I've seen studios in North America where people are like, I'm on the red team; I'm not going to work on the blue team. But here, we're all Team Saber. For instance, we are ramping people off Space Marine 2 because it's coming out soon. Now, those people will work on Jurassic Park Survival or Toxic Commando. That's how we remain lean and make money. We don't have ridiculously expensive budgets, so we don't have to sell four million copies to be a success, you know what I'm saying? There are games in North America that, if they don't sell 4 to 6 million copies, they are a failure. That is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Just one last question. Electronic Arts actually came out a few months ago during an investor's call after canceling a Star Wars game in development at Respawn to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> that they would lean less on licensed franchises in the future. Do you think that's where the industry is headed, partially to offset those growing budgets?</strong></p>
<p>Oh no, no. We're working on a Jurassic Park game. That's one of the world's biggest IPs, and we have other things we are working on that we haven't announced yet. No, you have to manage how much money you are spending on your team. You have to manage how your teams are working.</p>
<p>If you have the right brand, the right IP, it can really benefit you. Even we have had great success working with other IPs. Look at World War Z. I believe the game has made more money than the movie did—I believe, but I'm not sure about that. But you have to manage your teams and your business, and you have to make the right game with the right budget in the right part of the world. That's what we do well.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, well, thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 39 Minutes of COD: Black Ops 6 Zombies Gameplay Full Round On Liberty Falls</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is also the most ambitious Call of Duty game since Infinite Warfare in the jetpack era, with Black Ops 6's new omnimovement system that allows players to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction. Players can also go prone and spin around 360 degrees, making fancy moves that let them play out their own action-hero fantasy in matches of Call of Duty across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">We spoke with associate design director Matt Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller, and while the discussion held a focus on the development cycle and movement system, we were also able to touch a little on Black Ops 6's integration into Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">When discussing Black Ops 6's longer development time, Miller provided more insight into the first year of that development, explaining, "Part of that time was just getting the core Black Ops experience, rebuilding that from the ground up, and getting multiplayer to feel like Black Ops."</p><p dir="ltr">Miller stated he's not sure if Black Ops 6's new movement system would've come to fruition without the transition to the new engine, saying, "I don't know if omnimovement would have happened the same way, [and] I don't know if it's specifically because of the time, but I think part of it was because of the fact that we had to wipe the slate clean and start fresh with rebuilding movement from the beginning."</p><p dir="ltr">"And it really forced the team, and this is my perspective," Miller clarified, "to think of all the pieces that were really important, and that kind of led us down the path of, well, fluidity is king."</p><p dir="ltr">Putting a focus on fluidity for Black Ops 6 led Miller and the team to consider plenty of questions about movement in the game that eventually led to omnimovement.</p><p dir="ltr">"And you maybe wouldn't have had that [thought process] if you were building from the prior code base," Miller said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359787-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0152.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359787" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359787-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0152.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359787"></a><figcaption>Dive in any direction with omnimovement</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359787-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0152.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch games are also known for having a faster pace, a more arcade-style design, and a vibrant color palette. One of the community concerns prior to seeing Black Ops 6 footage, was wondering if Treyarch would lose its signature style on the new shared engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Scronce shared some insight to the studio's initial thoughts on keeping Treyarch's style when moving to the new engine. "It was definitely a huge focus," he said. "I wouldn't say it was a worry, really. That first year was like, let's get it feeling like a Black Ops game. Then, we started asking ourselves, what does a Black Ops game feel like? So, asking those hard questions and you come up with some really interesting answers, and it really lets you kind of galvanize what is a Black Ops game?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Every Black Ops has its own story," Scronce said. "And this one was like, oh, we're redefining what it means to be a Black Ops game."</p><p dir="ltr">Omnimovement is the biggest feature of Black Ops 6, and following the integration into Warzone, it will become one of the main focuses of battle royale for the new year. When discussing how Treyarch and Raven Software will keep Warzone fresh, Miller said, "I think the biggest change to Warzone, frankly, is going to be movement, and that's where a lot of our focus is. Working with that crew [Raven Software] on how we can make sure this stuff all feels right."</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, for Warzone players hoping to prestige this year, there will be a bit of a disadvantage. Black Ops 6 brings back Call of Duty's traditional prestige system, which will rest progression and locks all of the guns and attachments from level 1-55.</p><p dir="ltr">This might not be a burden for old-school Call of Duty players, but Treyarch confirmed this would be a shared prestige system across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. This will be Warzone's first year with a classic prestige system, so players who choose to prestige will need to grind to earn all of those weapons and attachments again for their meta loadouts. However, this classic-style prestige choice in Black Ops 6 and Warzone will be optional.</p><p dir="ltr">The choice to prestige in Black Ops 6 will offer some rewards, including unique Black Ops-themed cosmetics and permanent unlocks for things like weapons and perks. And the developer said players can choose to protect certain items from the reset with those permanent unlock token rewards, but otherwise all content unlocked from levels 1-55 will be reset with each prestige, regardless of which mode you play.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 will integrate with Warzone by adding Treyarch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/">new Area 99 Resurgence map</a>. In past years, a new Call of Duty integrated into Warzone with a standard, large-scale battle royale map, but this year will focus on a new Resurgence experience with Urzikstan remaining the large map until Warzone's original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-is-finally-returning-to-verdansk-in-2025/1100-6526178/">Verdansk map arrives in the spring</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359788-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359788-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359788"></a><figcaption>Area 99 map layout</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359788-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Scronce explained this by saying they were really focused on the new Resurgence map, because it was themed around Black Ops lore with it being the birthplace of Nuketown.</p><p dir="ltr">"That has been the focus," Miller added. "Bringing in an awesome new Resurgence map that only Treyarch can do was some of the way that we thought about it. The spring news is pretty big. So, I think it's going to be nice with Area 99, and then we're going to have big news in the spring, which obviously we have not had that kind of an opportunity in this way."</p><p dir="ltr">"Before you got a big map in the start, but you didn't get one in the spring," Miller continued. "So, I think it's about pacing the experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Our full GameSpot interview with Treyarch can be found below. For more on Black Ops 6, here are all <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">the announcements for launch-day content</a>. Players can get hands-on with multiplayer during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/">Black Ops 6 beta</a>, which is live now with week one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot:</strong> <strong>Just looking at the development time, this is the longest development cycle you guys have had. Do you feel like that was more or less pressure, and is there a feature that probably wouldn't have made it into the game if you didn't have this extended time? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> We moved from the Treyarch engine to the shared Call of Duty engine. So, part of that time was just getting the core Black Ops experience, rebuilding that from the ground up, and getting multiplayer to feel like Black Ops. That was a huge part of it. And I think with that huge transition of even just the tech change, how we needed to rebuild stuff, but also just all the really talented people at all the studios working on the stuff who came from working on the Treyarch engine to the Call of Duty engine. We were learning all the new tools and all those things. So, that was a big part of it.</p><p dir="ltr">I think the other one there is just like, because of how we rebuilt the stuff. I don't know if omnimovement would have happened the same way, but I don't know if it's specifically because of the time, but I think part of it was because of the fact that we had to wipe the slate clean and start fresh with rebuilding movement from the beginning. And it really forced the team, and this is my perspective, to think of all the pieces that were really important, and that kind of led us down the path of like, well, fluidity is king. Because you're reimplementing only sprint forward. You're like, why does that work that way? Why don't we try this? And you maybe wouldn't have had that [thought process] if you were building from the prior code base.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is omnimovement something you guys would be open to tweaking later on?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> Probably during the beta and probably beyond, that's probably the reality of it, because we'll try things.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think a lot of people were worried that with this new shared engine, Treyarch would maybe lose their signature style, but it definitely still looks like a Black Ops game. Were you guys worried about making the move over?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> It was a focus.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> It was definitely a huge focus. I wouldn't say it was a worry, really. That first year was like, let's get it feeling like a Black Ops game. Then, we started asking ourselves, what does a Black Ops game feel like? So, asking those hard questions and you come up with some really interesting answers, and it really lets you kind of galvanize what is a Black Ops game?</p><p dir="ltr">It was fun. I've worked on every single Black Ops game. Every Black Ops has its own story. And this one was like, oh, we're redefining what it means to be a Black Ops game. So, I'm glad it's come through.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359791-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359791" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359791-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359791"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6's Rewind multiplayer map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359791-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>For the Gunsmith, you talked about the global builds, but it seems like a more simplified version of the Gunsmith. Does this mean what we're seeing is what we're getting, or will there be additional features like aftermarket parts, or anything like that coming to the Gunsmith? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> I think what you're seeing is what you'll be getting in the beta. We're still working on some things, but you're right that it is a more simplified approach.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Which I don't think it's a bad thing!</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> Absolutely not. It was a big goal.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> Intentional.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> Every single thing we've done in Black Ops 6 is like, how do we streamline? How do we make it easier to get into? I mean, on the attachments, right? We talked about it. We have almost no cons on our attachments, right? We just want it to always feel great to put an attachment on your weapon. Now, some like a magazine, if you've got a big mag, you're gonna reload a little bit slower, but for the large majority of things, it's just gonna they're like, don't worry about it. What's your play style? Do you want ADS fast? You wanna move fast? Slap that on, put five attachments on, or throw a Wildcard on, go for eight attachments, and just have fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>But that's not set in stone, right? That's just what we're seeing for the beta, but you guys might still have other things to change it up?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> Yeah, for sure.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any game modes that we haven't seen today that are more centered around the omnimovement? I feel like this would play well with a mode like Blitz or Gridiron. Are there any other modes you can talk about today? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> Nothing to talk about right now. It's definitely a topic of conversation within the game modes team. And since omnimovement is a big part of Black Ops 6, we feel like it is a part of every game mode, just like you know, the weapons team make sure that it sits well within that world, but specifically movement based game modes and how can we lean into that? And some of the fun post launch stuff, we'll definitely talk about it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> New seasons will have new maps and modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359792-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0202.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359792" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359792-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0202.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359792"></a><figcaption>Take opponents hostage and use them as a meat shield in MP and Warzone</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4359792-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0202.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's so important to have loadouts in battle royale, but if you prestige in Black Ops 6, do you lose your gun and attachment unlocks across all modes, including Warzone?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> You can choose, and you can also choose to protect items.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> Yeah, permanent unlock tokens. But yeah, it'll, it'll reset your level 1 to 55 content.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Being four years into Warzone and once Black Ops 6 integrates, what do you plan on doing to keep it fresh content wise?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> So, I think for Ted [Timmins, Warzone Senior Creative Director at Raven Software] and all the folks at Raven, I think some of the big things are quality of life and improving the experience. And they're doing a lot of work looking at loot and even little things like zip lines and ascenders. Just improvements, improvements, improvements. We're excited.</p><p dir="ltr">I think the biggest change to Warzone, frankly, is going to be movement, and that's where a lot of our focus is. Working with that crew [Raven Software] on how we can make sure this stuff all feels right.</p><p dir="ltr">And then taking an intentional pass across all the perks, gear, and all those things. Just because Black Ops 6 stuff is coming, doesn't mean if there's this awesome piece of gear from a previous title or something that it should go away. So, it's like the best of everything.</p><p dir="ltr">The foundational change, though, I think is a big one. Really talking about Season 1, it's movement. Movement is going to be a huge change. And then I think they have a ton of plans, which we can't talk about here, on how to take it forward.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With Warzone in past years, we've gotten a big map within the integration during Season 1 or Season 1 Reloaded. But it looks like we're getting Verdansk in the spring, and we're keeping Urzikstan. Are we keeping that for the entirety of the time? Is there a reason you can provide for why a new big map isn't coming early on? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scronce:</strong> I can, I mean, we were heavily focused on Area 99 as the birthplace of Nuketown for Resurgence.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Miller:</strong> So, yeah, I think, that has been the focus. Bringing in an awesome new Resurgence map that only Treyarch can do was some of the way that we thought about it. The spring news is pretty big. So, I think it's going to be nice with Area 99, and then we're going to have big news in the spring, which obviously we have not had that kind of an opportunity in this way.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you got a big map in the start, but you didn't get one in the spring.

As Dame Shirley Bassey once famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLT6_TQmq8">bellowed</a>, "It's all just a little bit of history repeating". And so it is with this week's Epic Games Store giveaway of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> Classic Collection, which Tim Sweeney previously wafted at storeshop visitors in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-fallout-2-and-fallout-tactics-all-free-from-the-epic-games-store">December 2022</a> and February this year.
</p>
<p>
For those who didn't grab it previously, the good news is there's some <em>neato</em> stuff in the Fallout Classic Collection. You get, for instance, the game that started it all - Black Isle Studios' original 1997 post-apocalyptic RPG, Fallout - plus its 1998 sequel. Both, of course, are bona fide classics, and Eurogamer sang their praises as part of a retrospective back in 2011.
</p>
<p>
"From the unrelentingly bleak, darkly ironic tone to the novelty of the open-world, post-apocalyptic setting," Keza MacDonald <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-retrospective-article">wrote</a>, "from the inspired, cerebral turn-based combat system to the immense degree of variety and personality in the character-customisation, the superbly-written quests and characters and the gallows humour that underpins the games without lessening their emotional impact, even the well-placed, gritty violence; there's very little about the games that doesn't command as much respect now as they did a decade ago."

<p>
As for the Fallout Classic Collection's third game, 2001's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-tactics-brotherhood-of-steel">Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</a>, it's less widely revered, but still solidly enjoyable, introducing squad-based combat action to the isometric wasteland of its illustrious RPG predecessors. That, though, isn't <em>quite</em> everything Epic is giving away this week, and its full list of freebies looks something like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallout 1</li>
<li>Fallout 2</li>
<li>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</li>
<li>Wild Card Football</li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one, if it's previously managed to pass you by (I, also, was unfamiliar), comes from Saber Interactive, and is described as a "fun pick-up-and-play arcade-style football game featuring 7v7 team-focused gameplay with the unique Wild Card system that lets you change the course of the action in an instant with special power-ups and rule-breaking abilities."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wild-card-football">Wild Card Football</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/fallout-classic-collection">Fallout Classic Collection</a> can be permanently added to your Epic Games Store library for zero pee right now until next Thursday, 5th September. At which point Football Manager 2024 and Sniper Ghost Warrior will stumble blinking into the freebie arena, waiting to be snapped up by curious hands.

This American politician has blonde hair and a muscular chest covered in beastly hair, and harbours a treacherous past.</p><p>“Gokou is a character who is a mix of an American cowboy and a Japanese samurai,” explains Luo. “Although he is American, he is deeply knowledgeable about Japanese culture, and when you fight him, you will notice he pulls from both Eastern and Western cultures in his combat style.”</p><p>Luo continues, “While I cannot go into detail yet about the techniques Gokou uses in battle, he is closely connected with the background story of the game. He’s not the final boss or the overarching villain, but in our alternate history, Gokou is the Governor of Texas, and it was him who sold the land of Texas to Japan.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In our alternate history, Gokou is the Governor of Texas, and it was him who sold the land of Texas to Japan</p></div><p>While Gokou’s character model appears almost photorealistic, and development has included some photogrammetry, Luo explains that Gokou and most of the other main characters were initially hand-drawn, before being converted to 3D and added to the game. “Gokou’s design was inspired by a certain famous 1980s American rock star,” hints Luo. “Whether each character is created by hand or based on a 3D facial model, we take care to make sure they express realism. Since our development team is small – just 26 members – we are outsourcing some of the asset creation.”</p><p>Indeed, you can see from our exclusive set of new screenshots that the visual quality of the game has markedly improved since it was first revealed. Luo says that development is proceeding “as planned”, with his team aiming to achieve the quality they had first envisioned. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Show American Story - Exclusive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“With over two years of hard work by our incredible development team since the first trailer was revealed, and upgrading the game engine from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, the game looks much more solid, including the graphics,” says Luo, “However, compared to a large development team, I must say Showa American Story is not a AAA game, but I believe that it will exceed players’ expectations when it comes out.”</p><p>Showa American Story follows protagonist Chouko, a teenage action stuntwoman mysteriously revived from the dead, as she fights her way through hordes of monsters and zombies in a postapocalyptic 1980s United States that has been colonized by Japan. Heavily influenced by B-movies and American and Japanese pop-culture, the game is currently in development for PlayStation 5 and PC.

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-length/">Astro Bot game</a> isn't far away, with a release date of September 6, 2024. Players can expect plenty of references from previous PlayStation games, allowing them to get heavily involved in the nostalgia of previous consoles. Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment released the first of five trailers in the series 'Behind the Scenes of ASTRO BOT.'</p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/30/meet-astro-bots-new-monkey-friend-and-go-behind-the-scenes-with-team-asobi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand new blog</a> on the PlayStation website written by Nicolas Doucet, the Studio Head of Team Asobi, unveils the new trailer and showcases some of the features that players can expect to see in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unYFdcEjV9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is just two minutes long but showcases a lot of the fast-paced gameplay that people can expect from the upcoming Astro Bot game. One of the main features that will appear is a monkey that attaches to Astro's back and has long arms that allow Astro to climb, swing, and use giant hand slams to attack enemies and complete puzzles.</p>
<p>The Muteki armor set is also revealed, which allows Astro to roll around in spiky areas without taking damage, fit inside tight spaces, or be blasted through the air like a cannonball. Last of all, players will be able to use the Muteki armor to become the size of a mouse, allowing players to explore the world through the eyes of a very tiny creature.</p>
<p>In total, there are 300 bots that players can rescue worldwide, all serving their purpose to assist Astro in their own way. Out of the 300 bots, 150 of them are PlayStation cameos, allowing you to see little robots dressed up and styled to look like famous characters from previous franchises. The cameo bots will reenact moments from their respective games, allowing those who are playing Astro Bot to get a hit of nostalgia and remember all of the good times they've had with PlayStation.</p>
<p>This trailer and blog post combined also answer a lot of burning questions for those who want to know more about Astro Bot and his hero powers. Throughout your journey in the game, you will be able to use powers such as utilizing Kratos' Axe in a specific level tailored to the God of War franchise.</p>
<p>There are plenty more Hero powers that Astro will get to use throughout the game,&nbsp; but as the blog post says, it's being kept under wraps right now so that players will get to experience it as it's "one of the nicest features to discover yourselves."</p>
<p>In addition to the trailer and the blog post, a new Behind the Scenes series for Astro Bot has been announced. The first episode will be released today. It's only two minutes long but showcases some of the work that went into crafting the game play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Behind The Scenes Series EP1: Crafted Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aH0haX-5iZ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this episode, members of Team Asobi speak about what goes into the gameplay of Astro Bot to make it feel as smooth. In the short interview, they spoke about how they faced various challenges when making the game as smooth as possible and how making the game feel good was incredibly important. By making it feel good to play as well as good to watch, as "that is the difference between a good game and a great game," as said by Nicolas Doucet.</p>
<p>When asked what the most important thing is when creating a platformer, Hironori Yatoku, Lead Game Designer replied, "Tempo. You create your own melody through the rhythm of the movements." Adding on to that statement Masayuki Yamada, the Lead Gameplay Programmer. He believes that reactions are the most important thing: "I think it is most important when you press a button, the game reacts instantly. And if you knock the stick the other way, the right thing should happen."</p>
<p>Astro Bot is set for release on September 6, 2024. More Behind the Scenes videos will showcase the development process behind this upcoming PlayStation exclusive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232389/borderlands-movie-review-interview-video-on-demand<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The <em>Borderlands</em> movie, which released in theaters all of 21 days ago, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/borderlands-movie-streaming-release-date-vod-eli-roth-lionsgate-2000491551">is already available to watch at home</a> through video on demand. This three-week turnaround could be indicative of the movie’s <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/box-office-it-ends-with-us-beats-exectations-borderlands-flops-1236103106/">poor box office performance</a> coupled with its <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/borderlands-review-a-total-catastrophe.html">poor</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/11/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-stalks-her-way-through-a-disastrous-video-game-adaptation-eli-roth">critical</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/10/the-borderlands-movie-debuts-with-a-0-on-rotten-tomatoes/">reception</a>. After seeing it for myself, I agree it’s not the best example of a video game movie. However, I also saw moments where the movie took its source material and remixed it into something entertaining. Whether you watch this movie in theaters, at home, or not at all, <em>Borderlands </em>deserves your respect.</p><p>Part of that is because honestly, the movie isn’t <em>that</em> bad. It’s visually impressive, with gorgeous styling and action sequences that were actually intelligible instead of greasy-looking smears of CG. It has a bog standard found family / magical MacGuffin plot that manages to say something interesting about the whole “chosen one” trope.&nbsp;</p><p>Cate Blanchett stars as Lilith, a bounty hunter who travels to the planet Pandora to rescue a girl named Tina (Ariana Greenblatt) from the clutches of Roland, a Crimson Lance soldier gone rogue (Kevin Hart) and his psycho accomplice — movie’s description, not mine — Krieg (Florian Munteanu). Lilith discovers that Tina went willingly with her captors and with the unhelpful help of the robot Claptrap (voiced by Jack Black) and the expertise of Dr. Patricia Tanis (Jamie Lee Curtis), Lilith decides to help Tina acquire a powerful artifact to keep it out of the hands of her disgustingly wealthy father, Deukalian Atlas (Edgar Ramírez), CEO of the Atlas Corporation.</p><div><p>“[Borderlands] isn’t a video game movie.”</p></div><p>Pandora is a harsh desert planet marred by prodigious amounts of waste from both its human and natural inhabitants. If the movie<em> </em>followed the trends currently dominating television and film, the planet would look dark even in the daytime, and everything would be cast in the sickly orange filter Hollywood trots out every time there’s a movie set in a desert — looking at you, <em>Dune</em>. Instead, locations and characters are thoughtfully designed — and adequately lit, imagine that! — making for a movie that is visually pleasing to watch.</p><p>I was thoroughly taken aback by how good Cate Blanchett looked as Lilith. With her bright orange hair and deep blue sparkly jacket, Blanchett looked like she had been ripped directly out of the first <em>Borderlands</em> game. When Lilith made her first appearance, I turned to my husband and remarked that this is the most video game looking-ass video game movie I’ve ever seen (affectionate!). Everything else, from the rest of the cast to the props and sets, matched that visual energy without looking cartoonish or fake.</p><div><figcaption><em>Blanchett looks great and performs even better as Lilith.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: Lionsgate</cite></p></div><p><em>Borderlands</em>, for good or ill, eschewed some of the typical conventions for making a video game movie. Usually, there’s some moment in these kinds of films that functions as a nod to its progenitor. The first-person action sequence in <em>Doom</em> or the Rainbow Road race in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> come to mind.</p><p>In an interview with Randy Pitchford, creator of the <em>Borderlands</em> games and the film’s executive producer, I asked how he blurred the line between game and film. “We didn’t do any of that,” Pitchford answered. “I hate that shit.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to Pitchford, originally there were plans to make him the movie’s Easter egg for fans of the game, but seeing another video game movie made him change his mind.</p><div><p>“We didn’t do any of that. I hate that shit.”&nbsp;</p></div><p>“I voice a character in the games named <a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Crazy_Earl">Crazy Earl</a>, and I did five hours of makeup to become Crazy Earl,” he said. Pitchford said that he shot scenes for the movie but had a change of heart after seeing the moment in <em>Uncharted</em> when Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland randomly run into Nolan North, the voice actor who plays Nathan Drake in the games.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were two problems with that,” he said. “If you know who that is, you’re immediately pulled out of the universe. And if you don’t know, none of that makes any sense. It’s a complete non-sequitur to the storyline, so I asked them to cut me from the movie.”</p><p>According to Pitchford,<em> Borderlands</em> “isn’t a video game movie.” Rather, he says, it’s a movie that incorporates the characters, themes, and storylines from the first game, which have been greatly enhanced by stand-out performances from Blanchett and Greenblatt.</p><p>Lilith and Tina play well off each other. Neither has a loving family to speak of and is so desperate for one that they latch on to anyone and anything that comes within their orbit. Tina immediately adopts Kreig as her older brother / bodyguard. And despite the fact that Claptrap and Lilith hate each other, they still worked well together.</p><div><figcaption><em>The infamous pee scene.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Lionsgate</cite></p></div><p>The dialogue, though, didn’t work so well. Make no mistake: <em>Borderlands</em> isn’t funny. Its style of irreverent humor and stream-of-consciousness dialogue stopped being entertaining around the time <em>Tales for the Borderlands</em> came out in 2014. Hearing Kevin Hart deadpan, “It’s pee. Now I got pee all in the middle of my truck,” made me white knuckle my armrests to keep me from scratching out my eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie also didn’t make good use of its ensemble cast. Take Dr. Patricia Tanis, for example. In the movie, she’s just a plot exposition vehicle, but she could have been much more. According to Tanis’ actress, Jamie Lee Curtis, she brought herself into the role of the reclusive, socially awkward doctor and her attraction to inanimate objects — but that didn’t make it into the final film.</p><p>“The whole idea of objective sexuality — the idea of an isolated person falling in love with inanimate objects — I find it a fascinating character trait and played the shit out of it,” Curtis said. “And they cut it all because, I think, people just wouldn’t understand it.”</p><p>Lilith and Tina are the main drivers of the film, but the rest of the cast did absolutely nothing until the plot gave them something to shoot, smash, or exposit. I don’t understand how a movie that has both Jack Black and Kevin Hart — two of the most successful comedians in Hollywood — didn’t make me laugh. On top of being woefully miscast as the stoic soldier Roland, Hart was simply window dressing. The movie gave him a big hero moment similar to the one in <em>Borderlands 2</em>, but since he had no personality beyond “There’s pee in my truck,” I didn’t care. Meanwhile, it seemed like the only direction Black got was to be as annoying as possible. Fitting for his character, sure, but ultimately a waste of Black’s manifold talents.</p><p>Paying $20–25 to watch <em>Borderlands</em> at home is a tough sell but ultimately worth it. For all the bad decisions in <em>Borderlands</em>, putting Lilith at its center was by far its smartest. Characters like her — cranky, jaded, childless, older women — do not lead action films. And in real life, women like that are all but invisible. But <em>Borderlands</em>, in its styling and storytelling, made Lilith pop off the screen. You couldn’t miss her if you tried. <em>Borderlands </em>earned its poor reception, but for what it does with Lilith, it’s also earned my respect.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And he sounds like the most broody version of Reeves you can imagine, but it also works with the enigmatic, dangerous version of Shadow we see in the trailer.</p><p>What we’ve seen thus far feels like a happy medium between the theatrical villain he was in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851">boorish loner he’s become as of late</a></span>. However, that drama comes through in his mannerisms and the stylish way he fights. Skeptics are leaving the trailer as believers. However, some folks want to hear the full breadth of his performance and feel like they were expecting Reeves to put on more of a “voice.” This has been a contentious discussion point surrounding films like the <em>Super Mario Bros.

In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Shadow’s path of destruction begins after the death of Maria Robotnik, a young girl who Shadow was created to save from a life-threatening illness. Maria will be portrayed by <em>Furiosa </em>actor Alyla Browne, and based on the trailer, it looks like she will meet a similar fate in the film. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">Fans are (jokingly) excited</a></span>, but some also hope that the jokes don’t make their way into the theater, because hearing a bunch of people cheering as a child dies on-screen would not capture the somber tone of the scene.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f98191c30c27b269f0410495d2e53a0" data-recommend-id="image://6f98191c30c27b269f0410495d2e53a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="806" data-height="453" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f98191c30c27b269f0410495d2e53a0" data-recommend-id="image://6f98191c30c27b269f0410495d2e53a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="806" data-height="453" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Reeves has been mostly praised for his portrayal of Shadow thus far, a big point of contention surrounding <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> is that we’re three movies in and none of the women in the <em>Sonic </em>series have made an appearance yet. There was a lot of speculation ahead of the movie’s proper unveiling that Rouge the Bat, the treasure-hunting spy who works with Shadow in <em>Sonic Adventure 2,</em> may make her live-action debut in the film, but there’s no sign of her in the first trailer. Amy Rose, the hammer-swinging hero who also has a pretty significant role in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, is also nowhere to be seen. Though the movies have been gradually introducing Sonic’s anthropomorphic crew rather than dumping them all into the series at once, the lack of two major players and the obvious gender disparity is bumming fans out. Some are keeping hope alive, however, and theorize Amy may have been edited out of the trailer to surprise fans at a later date.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab23b76aadc9c39d5f21ed76b83cf028" data-recommend-id="image://ab23b76aadc9c39d5f21ed76b83cf028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1123" data-height="632" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow throws a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab23b76aadc9c39d5f21ed76b83cf028" data-recommend-id="image://ab23b76aadc9c39d5f21ed76b83cf028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1123" data-height="632" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So much happens in the <em>Sonic 3 </em>trailer that it feels like dozens of in-jokes have already sprouted up just from these three minutes of footage. This has ranged from putting exaggerated screams into footage of Shadow absolutely owning Knuckles to making edits of the villain’s chaos and destruction. The jokes are good, and the trailer also added to a longstanding meme of Shadow beating up Sonic’s best friend Tails, as he once again lays out the two-tailed fox in another continuity.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c6fa973f00f1c0dab98feed788a2235" data-recommend-id="image://0c6fa973f00f1c0dab98feed788a2235" data-format="jpg" data-width="2843" data-height="1600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robotnik puts one of Sonic's quills in his mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robotnik puts one of Sonic's quills in his mouth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c6fa973f00f1c0dab98feed788a2235" data-recommend-id="image://0c6fa973f00f1c0dab98feed788a2235" data-format="jpg" data-width="2843" data-height="1600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robotnik puts one of Sonic's quills in his mouth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The jokes are all well and good, but fans are looking for any clue about what’s coming from the trailer, and some theories seem pretty plausible. One scene shows Sonic giving Jim Carrey’s Doctor Robotnik one of his superpowered quills, and fans are already speculating this could be used to create his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-trailer-robotnik-metal-quill-theory-ending-1851634404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-trailer-robotnik-metal-quill-theory-ending-1851634404">synthetic doppelganger Metal Sonic</a></span>. While that’s a fun theory, there are also less fun ones sprouting up around possible death flags. One scene shows James Marsden’s Tom Wachowski, the human lead of the live-action movies, shouting for Sonic during what appears to be one of Shadow’s rampages. These movies haven’t shied away from death, as Sonic, Knuckles, and Shadow each have tragic backstories, but this might be the first time the movies kill off a main character. If Tom kicks the bucket, it would be thematically in-line with the topics of grief the movie is wrestling with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2fb9013535d1eb7d89168226567c1c34" data-recommend-id="image://2fb9013535d1eb7d89168226567c1c34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow does the Akira motorcycle slide." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow does the Akira motorcycle slide." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fb9013535d1eb7d89168226567c1c34" data-recommend-id="image://2fb9013535d1eb7d89168226567c1c34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow does the Akira motorcycle slide." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Theory-crafting, jokes, and critique are great, but what I love most about big blowouts like this is how they inspire creativity within the community.

<p>Tinner 4 Two is a joke collectible that Wired Productions <a href="https://shop.wiredproductions.com/products/tinner-4-two?srsltid=AfmBOopJ6gv6hmaWVLfYlV8vPAJaMtvjZh80-r0wBZwZqgbyXzr_lFB7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">offered for sale on its site</a> that combines cat food and spaghetti. However, it's not an actual blend of the two. The final product actually has two different tins joined together, one for the cat food and one for the spaghetti. A writer for <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/12311281/gori-cuddly-carnage-tinner4two/amp/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> sampled it and described the spaghetti as "inedible." So perhaps this is one collectible that's better left in the can.</p><p>Plus, as anyone who has ever owned a cat can attest, felines tend to prefer to be left alone while eating their own food. But if you ever dare to dine on something that a cat might enjoy--such as any meat product--then suddenly your furry companion won't leave you alone. So the idea of any "romantic" meal with a cat was always doomed from the start.</p><p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is available on all consoles and PC. There's also a demo, if you want to try it before buying it.</p>

			<p>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened was a mobile game published by Warner Bros. Games that has already shut down after just one year of being available to players. This game was a collectible card game made by Zen Studio and launched in June 2023.</p>
<p>However, as of August 26, 2024, the game was removed from both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, meaning no one can download the game at all now. However, those who wish to give the game a send-off will still be able to play the game until October 29, 2024, due to servers being kept open until said date. Microtransactions for the game have also been closed so that no one can make any in-game purchases. Despite Warner Bros. Games releasing a statement about the game being closed down, they haven't given any information or reason as to why the game is being shut down in the West.</p>
<p>Although Harry Potter: Magic Awakened will no longer be available in the West, those who are in Asia will still be able to play the game as normal, as it isn't being closed down there. The app is handled by NetEase over in Asia, with Warner Bros. Games having no involvement in the app over in that part of the world, meaning it is entirely up to NetEase with what they do next with Harry Potter: Magic Awakened.</p>
<p>As expected, those who enjoyed the game did not receive the news well and are already calling on Warner Bros. Games to refund them for any microtransactions they may have made, as well as attempting to petition NetEase into being handed the reigns for the game so that they can publish it in the West as well.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Games has put out <a href="https://portkeygamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/32591302636819-Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened-Officially-Closing-in-the-Americas-Europe-and-Oceania-territories-on-October-29-2024#:~:text=Q%3A%20When%20will%20Harry%20Potter,Play%20on%20August%2026%2C%202024." target="_blank" rel="noopener">an FAQ</a> regarding the closure of Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, saying that server transfers are out of the question, and that refunds will additionally not be possible. As well as full closure of the game, the official Discord server associated with the game will also be closed on October 29, 2024, as well as all associated social media channels, essentially wiping out the game from existence in the West.</p>
<p>While this game is disappearing for good in the West, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-debuts-new-harry-potter-quidditch-champions-trailer/">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a> is the latest game to be coming out within the well-loved franchise. However, this game will only be available on consoles and PC, rather than being an accessible mobile game. For those interested in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, the game comes out on September 3, 2024, with the Nintendo Switch release coming later in the holiday season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-original-trilogy-connections-timeline-zerek-besh<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Star Wars: Outlaws may focus on a new character - smuggler, thief, and all-around scoundrel Kay Vess - but it’s also a story set smack dab in the middle of the original Star Wars trilogy. The game takes place in between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. That leaves plenty of room for familiar heroes and villains to appear during the course of the game, and they definitely do.</p><p>How exactly does Outlaws fit into the bigger picture of the Original Trilogy? How does the game forge connections between Kay and iconic Star Wars heroes and villains? Here’s what you need to know.</p><p><em><strong>Warning: this article contains full spoilers for Star Wars: Outlaws!</strong></em></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Lady Qi’ra and Crimson Dawn</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/30/solo-db-history-qira-2-dc620a83-1725037308752.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In Outlaws, Kay slowly makes a name for herself and works her way up the chain of command in the game’s various criminal syndicates. It’s inevitable, then, that she’ll eventually encounter some familiar faces. The Star Wars franchise certainly has its share of memorable crime lords.</p><p>Kay eventually encounters Crimson Dawn’s leader, Lady Qi’ra, during her missions on the icy planet of Kijimi. Qi’ra was played by Emilia Clarke in 2018’s Solo: A Star Wars Story (though she’s voiced by Tamaryn Payne here), where we learned that she was Han’s old flame before being recruited into Dryden Vos’ organization. The movie ends with Vos being killed off and Qi’ra traveling to meet the real boss of Crimson Dawn, Darth Maul.</p><p>If you only follow the Star Wars movies, you might not know how Qi’ra’s story has unfolded since then. She eventually takes control of Crimson Dawn herself after Maul is killed shortly before the events of A New Hope (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/21/star-wars-rebels-sam-witwer-on-mauls-fateful-encounter-with-obi-wan"><u>as seen in the animated series Star Wars Rebels</u></a>). Qi’ra has gone on to play a pivotal role in Marvel’s Star Wars comics; she’s at the center of<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-bounty-hunters-boba-fett-han-solo-carbonite"><u> 2021’s War of the Bounty Hunters crossover</u></a>, where she steals the carbonite-frozen Han from Boba Fett and auctions him off to the highest bidder. In Outlaws, ND-5 even references that ill-fated auction in a conversation with Kay.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Qi’ra wants to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the Sith, which is what she’s referencing when she talks to Kay about true freedom.</p></div><p>As War of the Bounty Hunters and subsequent storylines establish, Qi’ra’s ultimate goal with Crimson Dawn is to use it to destabilize the Empire. A loyal pupil of Maul, Qi’ra understands better than most how Emperor Palpatine has been pulling the strings of the galaxy for decades. Qi’ra wants to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the Sith, which is what she’s referencing when she talks to Kay about true freedom. So although Qi’ra comes across as an antagonistic figure in this game, manipulating Kay and using her to help weaken the upstart Clan Ashiga, ultimately her goals are pretty noble. </p><p>What happens to Qi’ra after the events of Star Wars: Outlaws? As explored in comics like Star Wars: Crimson Reign and Star Wars: Hidden Empire, Qi’ra eventually makes her move against Palpatine. While unsuccessful in destroying the Sith herself, Qi’ra’s actions help give the Rebel Alliance a much-needed boost and lay the groundwork for Palpatine’s eventual defeat at the Battle of Endor. With Crimson Dawn in ruins, Qi’ra goes into hiding. Her post-Return of the Jedi story has yet to be told. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Wrath of Darth Vader</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/30/darth-vader-2-review-s1mv-1725037321545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Is it a proper Star Wars game without an appearance from the Dark Lord of the Sith? Darth Vader himself plays a small but key role in Outlaws as players learn the truth behind Sliro and Zerek Besh. It turns out that the galaxy’s newest and hottest criminal syndicate is actually just a front for the Imperial Security Bureau. Sliro himself is a soldier for the Empire, albeit one who has used his position to amass great wealth and power.</p><p>The ISB has played a major role in many Star Wars projects in the Disney era, most notably Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and the Andor series. This organization represents the other form of Imperial power during the Galactic Civil War. Star Destroyers and Death Stars are great, but when it comes to rooting out terrorists and Rebel sympathizers, sometimes a subtler hand is needed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The goal of Zerek Besh is to build a vast intelligence network that can pierce the criminal underworld and reveal the identity of many hidden Rebel agents.</p></div><p>As Outlaws reveals, that’s exactly what Palpatine has tasked Sliro with accomplishing. The goal of Zerek Besh is to build a vast intelligence network that can pierce the criminal underworld and reveal the identity of many hidden Rebel agents. But although Sliro has managed to quickly build a powerful syndicate, he hasn’t actually produced the results Palpatine desires. That’s where Vader comes in. He’s a terrifying enforcer meant to remind Sliro that failure for someone in his position means death.</p><p>Vader ultimately seals Sliro’s doom by agreeing to hand control of Zerek Besh over to Jaylen Vrax (revealed to be Sliro’s estranged half-brother). Thanks to Kay, though, Jaylen is stopped before he can give over the valuable intel to the Empire, and Zerek Besh is effectively destroyed along with Jaylen himself. </p><p>In her own way, Kay herself winds up contributing to the downfall of the Empire in the build-up to Return of the Jedi. Zerek Besh’s destruction robs the ISB of a valuable resource and weakens what had been one of Palpatine’s most potent weapons against the Rebellion. The failure of Zerek Besh likely made Palpatine pivot all the more towards battlestations and weapons of mass destruction as a means of maintaining order. And we all know how that works out for him in the end…</p><h2>Gambling With Lando Calrissian</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/30/open-uri20150608-27674-1pgmn1l-1eb91341-1725037335783.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While most of the core heroes of the Star Wars Original Trilogy remain MIA in Outlaws, busy with rebuilding the struggling Rebel Alliance, Kay does meet one key figure during her travels. It’s only fitting that she rubs elbows with fellow scoundrel and gambler Lando Calrissian (voiced by Lindsay Owen Pierre).</p><p>Lando appears to be up to his old tricks in the game, as he approaches Kay with a mission to recover a valuable artifact he gambled away in a high-stakes game of Sabacc. That’s a callback to the time Lando infamously lost the Millennium Falcon to Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story.</p><p>But after winning the item back and helping a band of Rebels fight off an Imperial attack, Kay learns the truth behind her mission. Lando was using the artifact as a covert way of retrieving intelligence from a Rebel spy planted in the criminal underworld. His days of idly gambling away his most valuable possessions are behind him.</p><p>This questline gives greater insight into Lando’s role in the Rebellion before becoming “General Calrissian” in Return of the Jedi. At this point in the timeline, Lando and Chewbacca have tried and failed to liberate Han from Jabba the Hutt’s palace, and Lando hasn’t yet taken up a cover identity as one of Jabba’s palace guards. He’s simply biding his time, fighting alongside the Rebels and proving he has the heart of a hero.</p><p>Lando also shows us what Kay could become if she, like him, commits herself fully to a cause bigger than herself. As mentioned earlier, Kay winds up dealing a significant blow to the Empire without necessarily even meaning to. What could she accomplish if she put her mind to it? For now, though, Kay is concerned with protecting her own crew and making a few credits wherever she can. Maybe she’ll think bigger in the sequel.  </p><p>We know this won’t be the only encounter between Kay and Lando. The first DLC story campaign for Outlaws, “Wild Card,” will reunite the two as Kay enters a Sabacc tournament while working for the Empire. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Meeting the Future Resistance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/30/snap-wexley-main-41d2bba2-1725037347716.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Outlaws may be set during the Original Trilogy, but there is one familiar character from the Sequel Trilogy who appears during the course of the game. During a mission on the planet Akiva, Kay encounters a teenage mechanic named Temmin Wexley (voiced by Sam Scherzer). Fans may know him better as hotshot Resistance pilot Snap Wexley (played by Greg Grunberg in the movies). </p><p>The game builds on the origin story for Temmin that was established in the Star Wars Aftermath novels. At this point in his life, Temmin is on his own, with his father having been captured by the Empire and his mother serving in the Rebellion. He’s a humble mechanic who builds droids to keep himself company. Eventually, though, Temmin will follow in his mother’s footsteps and join the Rebels, training under no less an authority on piloting starships than Wedge Antilles. The rest is history.</p><h2>The Hondo Ohnaka Easter Egg</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/30/hondo-ohnaka-6ab3af8b-1725037360012.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Outlaws features an Easter egg that seems to be directly setting up future DLC missions. During one of Kay’s encounters with Tatooine’s Sheriff Quint, Quint references the infamous pirate Hondo Ohnaka. Hondo is basically ubiquitous in animated series like The Clone Wars and Rebels, and it seems he’s going to make his video game debut soon. </p><p>This Easter egg seems to be setting up the game’s second DLC campaign, dubbed “A Pirate’s Fortune.” There, Kay will team up with Hondo to seek out a legendary treasure. But can she actually trust this notoriously self-serving criminal? Probably not. </p><p>Which iconic Star Wars character should Kay Vess meet next?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official Multiplayer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>A big change for Black Ops 6's beta compared to the beta tests for past Call of Duty games is that the beta is available on all platforms at once. In the past, PlayStation users got in first because Sony paid Activision. But Microsoft now owns Call of Duty and has changed the playbook.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1829570463582109883" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement from the Call of Duty Updates account</a> said Black Ops 6 is implementing login queues to help deal with the server load. And for players who are able to get in, they might run into extended matchmaking wait times. "We're working to deploy more servers to get players in-game and matches started," the company said.</p><p>The Black Ops 6 beta is available now for people who preordered the game or have Xbox Game Pass. Other ways to get in early include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">having Xfinity or paying $1 for a Game Pass trial</a>. The early-access period runs until September 4. After that, an open beta available to everyone runs September 6-9.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches in full on October 25, and it includes a campaign mode set in the '90s, multiplayer, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-everything-we-know/1100-6525644/" data-ref-id="1100-6525644">Zombies (with the return of round-based matches)</a>.</p>

            <p>I took a longer lunch break today, and must now Pay The Reaper by staying after work. Fortunately, I've spent my penance playing the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witching-stone">Witching Stone</a>, which applies the magic of shape-matching to the magic of, well, magic. Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that "combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.</p><!--more-->

<p>The setup: you are an anime sorceress exploring a node-based dungeon map. Some nodes harbour treasure chests, campsites and shopkeepers. Others trigger battles, which are turn-based affairs. Rather than just choosing Firaga from a menu, however, you'll need to string together the raw materials on the grid display below the warring characters.</p>
<p>Each spell needs a different mix of shapes, and while you can cast several simultaneously, you can only draw a line through a certain number of squares per turn. Firing off a spell also deletes those shapes from the grid, causing others to fall from above, so in addition to selecting the optimal wizardry, you're trying to clear away undesired shapes and set up combinations for your next turn.</p>
<p>If you've ever played the glorious Puzzle Quest games or Capcom's Puzzle Fighter series, you'll find all this very intuitive. As in Puzzle Quest, there's a progression system. In this case, it's about expanding your spellbook and modding your spells. The Giant Slayer mod, for example, makes your lightning bolt deal more damage at the expense of always targeting the beefiest opponent. Even based on the 15 minutes I've played, it feels like there's scope for some hair-raising concoctions, and what is a witch who doesn't deal in hair-raising concoctions? A sham, that's what. An embarrassment.</p>
<p>All told, this was well worth loitering after five for - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693530/Witching_Stone/">find the demo on Steam</a>. In general, I'm always in favour of video game sorcery that involves the actual assemblage of spells - it stops them feeling like guns. If you despise grid puzzles and would prefer a real-time incarnation of all this, let me join up three squiggly blue diamonds to make a Hex Of Greater Displacement and warp you in the direction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These sales are often great opportunities to buy games you might’ve missed or may never have heard of for a pretty good price. For example, there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-series-humble-bundle-sale-1851635986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-series-humble-bundle-sale-1851635986">killer <em>Resident Evil </em>sale</a></span> bundle available right now, and you can get the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-sale-playstation-1851636254&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-sale-playstation-1851636254"><em>Hitman </em>trilogy for dirt cheap too</a></span>.</p><p>PlayStation is currently holding a sale and here’s what I think you should prioritize as you sift through those digital store shelves.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354"><em>It Takes Two </em>won Game of the Year</a></span> back in 2021, shocking a bunch of people, myself included. In retrospect, it wasn’t that much of an impossibility. <em>It Takes Two </em>is, for what it’s worth, still the very best co-op game I’ve played. So many experiences are made better by just having another person or two around, but Hazelight Games went the extra mile to make a game catered to co-op and ingenuity. Across the span of the game, you play as a miniaturized couple on the cusp of divorce who have to learn to overcome their differences in order to make it back to their normal life and daughter. The wonderfully fantastical journey they go on transforms <em>It Takes Two </em>from just another 3D platformer into <em>so </em>much else.</p><p>At one point, <em>It Takes Two </em>jokingly becomes a 2D fighting game. At another junction, it becomes a third-person shooter. At yet another, it’s a decently compelling top-down ARPG like <em>Diablo</em>. You ride frogs throughout one level, and skate across an icy landscape in another. <em>It Takes Two </em>is constantly reinventing itself over the course of a playthrough, and crafts situations that test both players in unique ways the entire time. <strong>There is not a more diverse co-op offering out there, and you can have </strong><em><strong>It Takes Two</strong></em><strong> for just $14. </strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span><em> </em>is my favorite rhythm game of the last few years. A character action game set to the pulsing beats of a rip-roaring soundtrack, <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>is already one of the greats in my eyes, which made Xbox’s closure of the studio behind it a real blow earlier this year. Fortunately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190">Tango Gameworks has been resurrected</a></span>, and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>seems like it’ll continue on after all.</p><p>That means that you all have no excuse not to pick it up, especially since it’s one of the Xbox exclusives that made the leap to other consoles. Believe me, you want to play a game where you get bonus damage by matching button presses and attacks to the metronome of the song literally playing in the main character’s heart, all while he dons a makeshift electric guitar made of metal scrap and screams about just wanting to be a rockstar. <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>is so earnest and idealistic that you can’t help but love it, and its anti-capitalist story and visuals are just the cherry on top of that sundae. <strong>You can rock out to your heart’s content in </strong><em><strong>Hi-Fi Rush </strong></em><strong>for just $18.</strong></p></div><div><p>Often, video games are a lot. They are too big, too loud, even too bright. They are certainly too long nowadays, and even a little too intense. When I need a game to shut my brain off and just blast some music (mostly Taylor Swift) I go to <em>Powerwash Simulator</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like, and evolve into the final form of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259">closeted clean freak persona</a></span>. Go around town and spray down houses, municipal buildings, and parks for money. Just turn the world off and clean. <strong><em>Powerwash Simulator </em>is the ultimate brain-pleaser and you too can get regular releases of dopamine by picking it up for $17.49.</strong></p></div><div><p>With the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-caulfield-new-game-1851528883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-caulfield-new-game-1851528883">upcoming <em>Life is Strange</em></a></span><em> </em>title bringing back the first game’s protagonist, you may as well catch up on the life and all-too strange times of Max Caulfield. Taking place in a Pacific Northwestern town called Arcadia Bay, <em>Life is Strange </em>follows Max and her best friend Chloe as they make sense of being teenagers, their own thorny relationships, and Max’s newfound ability to rewind time. Quintessential teen shit, y’know?</p><p><em>Life is Strange </em>was acclaimed at the time for its subject matter and fresh perspective, centering a queer teenage girl and her peers who dealt with depression, suicide, sexual assault, and abuse among other things. However, the series is probably most beloved for its soft, sometimes even twee, aesthetics and deliberately nostalgic vibes. Even just writing about it prompted me to queue folksy indie songs featured throughout the series. Something about it just makes me long for it to be 2015 again. It instills in me this intense desire to walk down the hallways of my old high school, be surrounded by some of those faces I haven’t seen in nearly a decade, and not have to worry about a thing beyond my grades and the girl I was crushing on. <em>Life is Strange </em>feels like simpler times, even if it isn’t and that is perhaps the series’ greatest feat. <strong>You can pick up both the remaster of the first game and its prequel, </strong><em><strong>Before the Storm</strong></em><strong>, in this collection for $20. </strong><br></p></div><div><p>Ahead of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-trailer-lilith-handsome-jack-eridian-1851627952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-trailer-lilith-handsome-jack-eridian-1851627952">eventual release of <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span>, me and my friends are diving into the entire 2K RPG series. After much deliberation, and a confusing roll of a 20-sided die, we landed on trying the fantasy-tinged spinoff <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em>. Set within a tabletop-RPG world, <em>Wonderlands </em>maintains the series’ trope of guns, more guns, and even more guns, while translating much of the writing and character abilities to fit a more magical world. As long as you’ve got a good crew with you, these games are often a breezy and joyous time. <strong>You can get the PS4 version of </strong><em><strong>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands </strong></em><strong>for $12, and the PS5 version (along with the season pass) in the </strong><em><strong>Chaotic Great </strong></em><strong>edition for $18. </strong></p></div><div><p><em>Prey </em>has, by my estimation, the best opening to a game ever. It’s been over seven years since it first released, and I’m sure many people have seen it, but even now, I hesitate to give it away. It’s just something you need to see and feel for yourself, which is true of <em>Prey </em>itself. Words have often failed me when I try to describe <em>Prey </em>and why it’s one of the greatest games of our time, with some of the best worldbuilding, characterization, and meaningful progression systems. Talos I is still one of the best settings I’ve ever explored in a game, and one of the few worlds that made poking at its edges and corners a genuine reward. The shape-shifting and psi-blasting Typhon remain some of my favorite enemies, and no matter how far along in the game I got, or how powerful I grew, I loved that I never felt safe or secure. I still consider so many of my encounters against them as a high point in first-person shooters, stealth games, and the weird nexus of those genres that immersive sims like <em>Prey </em>find themselves in. I genuinely believe that a lot of people (myself included) didn’t get <em>Prey </em>at first, or refused to, but once you dig into it, it becomes apparent that it is one of the all-timers. <strong>You should pick up </strong><em><strong>Prey </strong></em><strong>while it’s only $6.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Void Bastards </em>is a lovely little experiment of a game. In it, you get to play as a randomly generated convict sent into derelict ships possessed by all manner of aliens, robots, and subtly supernatural creatures. Sprites, as well as much of the environment, are rendered in a flat comic book style and cel-shading, but the game plays like a roguelike first-person shooter and immersive sim across a series of bite-sized levels. To further mix things up, your character is generated with randomized traits, including buffs and debuffs that can be game-changing, hilarious, or both. Some simply make you tinier, which does reduce your hitbox, but others can make you yell when you pick things up, alerting enemies, or alternatively, make you impossible to spot. It can be a bit unwieldy, but it’s always a blast and it was successful enough to merit a spiritual successor, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, which is releasing in a few weeks. <strong>Try out </strong><em><strong>Void Bastards </strong></em><strong>ahead of that release for $9.</strong></p></div><div><p>If you own a PlayStation console, I think you just owe it to yourself to experience what sometimes feels like Sony’s last really great bonafide blockbusters: the <em>Uncharted </em>series. Unfortunately, the <em>Nathan Drake Collection</em> doesn’t include every game to star the eponymous rogue, but it does boast the trio that was released on the PS3. The first game is a little wonky, seeing as how it was Naughty Dog’s first foray into a full-blown third-person shooter (relax, I love the <em>Jak </em>games but those do not count) and a debut title for the PS3, but eventually the team got <em>really </em>good at these. In fact, they immediately got much better, as <em>Uncharted 2 </em>was widely heralded as the de facto game of the year upon release in 2009. It’s wild to consider how a linear third-person shooter that you can wrap in about 10-15 hours was considered the peak of gaming when it now eschews everything that the industry currently values.</p><p><em>Uncharted </em>is just <em>Indiana Jones </em>if it were modernized and made into a game before Bethesda and MachineGames went ahead and actually did that. The series is constantly escalating the action and stakes with increasingly impressive setpieces, such as an escape from a derailed train hanging off the side of a mountain, a classic level on top of a moving train, and a gunfight in the ballroom of a capsizing cruise ship. Nathan is a hot smart mouth who gets all the girls, and even has a rotating series of trusty sidekicks/allies. His adventures take him all over the world in the pursuit of treasure, and every now and then he even uncovers places and people of legend. <strong>It’s a good time, and you can get the </strong><em><strong>Nathan Drake Collection </strong></em><strong>for just $10.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Tetris </em>has always been able to make players feel something. Whether that’s despair at a loss, or overwhelming joy at a triumph, it has always been able to elicit a feeling. I stress this because <em>Tetris Effect </em>is often burdened with this perception that its combination of lush visuals, emotive music, and satisfying gameplay finally transformed <em>Tetris </em>into some higher form of art. I disagree: <em>Tetris </em>has always been this piercing, <em>Tetris Effect </em>just decided to make it plain as day.<br></p><p>What can be said about <em>Tetris Effect </em>and the rest of the series that hasn’t already been said somewhere else by someone with a bigger and better brain than me. It is the latest incarnation of <em>the </em>video game. Not the first one, but the one that outlined the form long before I was ever even a twinkle in my father’s eye. Before we discoursed ad nauseam about artfulness in games, <em>Tetris </em>was a living, breathing, reactive, and most importantly, challenging mosaic.<br></p><p><em>Tetris Effect Connected</em>, which adopts the last bit of its title from a song featured in the game, brings further multiplayer capabilities to the title. Like all great art, <em>Tetris Effect Connected </em>is wonderful and edifying to share with others, be they strangers or your closest friends. We’re all connected after all. You can (and should) snag <em>Tetris Effect Connected </em>on PlayStation. <strong>The PS4 version, which lacks PSVR2 support, will run you $20, while the PS5 version that does costs $30. </strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They want quirky characters, likable protagonists, heart-wrenching romances, and thrilling storylines. Thankfully, September offers a bit of everything.</p><p>From <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> and <em>Megalopolis</em> to<em> Agatha All Along </em>and<em> The Penguin</em>, we’ve got a strong month ahead of us with some big and small screen stories to nerd out over. Read on to see which movies and TV shows you should be watching this September.</p></div></div><div><p>Michael Keaton returns to the iconic role of <em>Beetlejuice</em> in a sequel many didn’t believe would or could happen so long after the first film’s release. On September 6, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> graces screens worldwide, with Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega, Monica Belluci, and Willem Dafoe starring alongside Keaton in a bonkers combination of comedy and horror. The sequel takes place 36 years after <em>Beetlejuice</em>, with the Deetz family once more turning to Winter River and reopening the Afterlife, releasing Beetlejuice upon the world.</p></div><div><p>In his most recent roles, James McAvoy has cemented himself as a fantastic and eerie antagonist with a penchant for psychotic mayhem at the drop of a hat. In <em>Speak No Evil</em>, which hits theaters on September 13, McAvoy, starring as “Paddy” alongside Mackenzie Davis’ “Louise” and Scoot McNairy’s “Ben,” heads to the countryside for an idyllic vacation that turns sour. The psychological horror movie promises plenty of twists and turns as the perfect vacation spot becomes a nightmare for everyone involved.</p></div><div><p>With a plot line that’s become more prevalent in recent years, <em>Subservience</em> tells the story of an AI that becomes self-aware and extremely deadly to the humans around her. On September 13, Megan Fox, starring opposite Michele Morrone, stars as a rogue AI designed to make family life easier but inevitably forces everyone within her reach into a frantic, adrenaline-pumping race for survival.</p></div><div><p>From the team behind <em>WandaVision</em>, Marvel Television returns with another series about a spell-casting witch wielding unimaginable powers in the form of <em>Agatha All Along</em>. Kathryn Hahn, known for <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, and <em>Bad Moms</em>, stars alongside Aubrey Plaza and Paul Adelstein on a fantastic journey full of supernatural action, adventure, and appropriate touches of comedy. <em>Agatha All Along</em> tells the story of a powerful woman who gains her freedom and embarks on a journey to reclaim her abilities on the Witches’ Road, and you can watch it all unfold on September 18.</p></div><div><p>Starring Colin Farrell in the titular role, <em>The Penguin</em> follows the iconic villain from DC Comics’ Batman franchise. Premiering September 19, the limited series follows The Penguin’s rise to power as he attempts to take control of Gotham City from its underbelly. The series features eight episodes, with the finale concluding the tale on November 10. The saga continues Penguin’s storyline from <em>The Batman</em> (2022), giving fans greater insight into the villain’s rise.</p></div><div><p><em>Transformers One</em> returns to the franchise’s roots as an animated film based on the toy line instead of the live-action series many associate it with. On September 20, <em>Transformers One</em>, starring Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, and others hits theaters across the U.S. The animated film follows Optimus Prime and Megatron in a first-of-its-kind origin story set on Cybertron, depicting how the two became archenemies.</p></div><div><p>It’s an excellent month for those who enjoy horror, with <em>The Substance</em> covering the body horror sub-genre on September 20. Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid star in this upcoming flick that premiered at the 77th Cannes Film Festival. At the core of its premise, once injected, a miracle drug creates a better version of the user. The results turn horrific as the two versions fight over control, tearing apart the one body they share.</p></div><div><p>Francis Ford Coppola, the iconic director known for such films as <em>The Godfather </em>and <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, gathers an ensemble cast in <em>Megalopolis</em>—an epic science-fiction drama starring Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, Laurence Fishburne, and many other high-profile stars. Releasing theatrically on September 27, <em>Megalopolis</em> tells the story of New Rome, where an architect can control time and rebuild the city into a utopia following a disaster of immense proportions.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wild Robot</em>, the month’s second high-profile animated film following <em>Transformers One</em>, releases in theaters on September 27. Starring Lupita Nyong’o (<em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>) and Pedro Pascal (<em>The Last of Us</em>), the film follows along the book series of the same name and features a robot named “Roz,” who is shipwrecked on an island and must learn to survive by building relationships with the animals living there. DreamWorks may have a winner on its hands that both children and adult fans of animation will love.</p></div><div><p>When it launched in 2010, <em>The Walking Dead</em> became a cultural phenomenon. Over a decade later, the television series has branched into numerous spinoffs focusing on specific characters. Perhaps the most iconic of these characters is none other than Daryl Dixon, the gruff zombie-slayer played by Norman Reedus since day one. The spinoff in question, <em>The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon</em>, which returns for its second season on September 29, is dubbed <em>The Book of Carol</em> but follows the titular character in France as he struggles to comprehend how he wound up in Europe and how he can return home.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Xur won't have Exotic class items every week, so you'll want to farm for Strange Coins to have enough to buy multiple rolls.</p><h3>Celestial Nighthawk (Exotic Hunter helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359699-destiny22024-08-3019-07-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359699-destiny22024-08-3019-07-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359699"></a><figcaption>Celestial Nighthawk</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359699-destiny22024-08-3019-07-54.jpg"></figure><p>A classic from Destiny 2's first year, Celestial Nighthawk lets you fire one single high-damage shot from the Golden Gun Super instead of three. You can reduce the cooldown of your Super pretty quickly with this Exotic, and it works very nicely with the Still Hunt Exotic sniper rifle, even after a recent nerf. The stats on this helmet are weird, as it has low resilience, strength, and discipline, while recovery is almost maxed out. Intellect is also high, so if you're going all in on the Super-centric nature of this helmet, it could be a good one to grab this week.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 3</li><li>Resilience: 7</li><li>Recovery: 25</li><li>Discipline: 8</li><li>Intellect: 19</li><li>Strength: 2</li><li>Total: 64</li></ul><h3>Severance Enclosure (Exotic Titan chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359700-destiny22024-08-3019-08-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359700-destiny22024-08-3019-08-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359700"></a><figcaption>Severance Enclosure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359700-destiny22024-08-3019-08-03.jpg"></figure><p>Like the best Titan Exotics, Severance Enclosure enhances your punching ability with some explosive firepower. As long as you have a charged melee, you can detonate your fist against anything that gets in your way. Strength and discipline are pretty good on this roll, recovery is average, and resilience could be better as mobility is unnecessarily high on this Exotic. It's not an entirely bad version of the chest armor, and because Xur seldom stocks it, it's worth grabbing now as it still has plenty of potential.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 14</li><li>Resilience: 6</li><li>Recovery: 12</li><li>Discipline: 19</li><li>Intellect: 2</li><li>Strength: 12</li><li>Total: 65</li></ul><h3>Crown of Tempests (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359701-destiny22024-08-3019-08-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359701-destiny22024-08-3019-08-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359701"></a><figcaption>Crown of Tempests</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359701-destiny22024-08-3019-08-10.jpg"></figure><p>Sure, it's one of the ugliest Exotics in Destiny, but Crown of Tempests makes up for it by being brilliant to equip when you're using an Arc subclass, as it enhances the duration of the Stormtrance Super and increases the recharging rate of your Arc abilities when you apply ability or jolt effects to enemies. It also works very well with getting your Super recharged quickly when using the Prismatic subclass, so it's worth being a walking fashion disaster when wearing this. For the stats, they're a bit all over the place, but the good news is that you're getting high resilience and strength. Recovery will need to be buffed and discipline is average, as mobility chews up some points from those categories.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 17</li><li>Resilience: 16</li><li>Recovery:

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

Games has announced the closure of mobile game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-magic-awakened">Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</a> just over a year after its global launch.</p><p>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, a collectible card role-playing game developed by Zen Studio, launched in the west in June 2023 courtesy of Warner Bros. Games’ Portkey Games publishing label. In the game you play as a new student at Hogwarts and collect cards you deploy as spells in duels.</p><p>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened was removed from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store on August 26, with servers running until October 29, 2024. It is now no no longer possible to make in-game purchases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Its Asian release was handled by Chinese games company NetEase, currently in the headlines <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-dev-reportedly-being-shut-down-by-netease">for reportedly shutting down the Visions of Mana developer, Ouka Studios</a>. Despite its shutdown in the west, Harry Potter: Magic Awakened will remain available to play in Asia.</p><p>“We have shared the magical journey of Harry Potter: Magic Awakened with millions of fans around the globe,” Warner Bros. said in a statement published to its <a href="https://portkeygamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/32591302636819-Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened-Officially-Closing-in-the-Americas-Europe-and-Oceania-territories-on-October-29-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support website</a>.</p><p>“The time has come for Harry Potter: Magic Awakened to officially close its servers in the Americas, Europe and Oceania territories on October 29, 2024. The game will continue to be available for players in Asia, including Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, as well as other select Asia and MENA territories.</p><p>“We’d like to thank those in the Americas, Europe and Oceania for playing, and are incredibly proud and honored that so many fans all around the world have enjoyed Harry Potter: Magic Awakened with such enthusiasm and passion.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The time has come for Harry Potter: Magic Awakened to officially close its servers.</p></div><p>Already players have expressed their disappointment in the news, asked for refunds, and called on Warner Bros. to allow NetEase to publish the game in the west or enable the transfer of servers. Warner Bros. ruled out server transfers and refunds in an FAQ, and declined to comment when contacted by IGN on the possibility of NetEase taking on the game in the west.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the closure of Harry Potter: Magic Awakened comes ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a>, a new game based on the fictional sport. That’s out on September 3 across PC and console.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
