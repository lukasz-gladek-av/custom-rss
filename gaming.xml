		<p>Ooooh, it’s the big spooky edition of What We Played, the one possessed by the Devil’s number. So, in the finest traditions of this feature, I asked everyone to not only tell me their gaming habits of the week gone by, but to also tell me their favourite thing about the Devil and/or the occult.</p>
<p>For me? Well, I kind of just think that pentagrams look neat and are fun to draw. It’s a bit like the ‘Cool S’, but more witchy and goth. Also, I think The Good Place could probably count here. I need to rewatch that show sometime!</p>
<p>My gaming this week has been anything but devilish… unless you think pirate cats are the work of the dark one. I wrapped up our review of the cute and fun action RPG action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/cat-quest-3-review/">Cat Quest 3</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> favourite thing about the occult is a bit of silly wordplay, as he says “Dungeons and Dragons is a cult but is also good.” He should know, because he’s a fully fledged member, having played D&amp;D three times in the past week an had “a blast every time”. He’s also played an awful lot of Dome Keeper.</p>

<p>It’s “everything” occult for <strong>Nic</strong>, with the one caveat that the cult of Taylor Swift is “too intense” for him. And so he’s been burrowing back into MTG Arena, shifting back into the digital game after a spell – geddit? – of only playing paper. He has thoughts on the new Bloomburrow expansion, which “is phenomenally cute, but it turns out underpowered relative to what we’ve had recently. Its effect on the meta has been somewhat less than I had hoped!”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> reckons that “demons have all the best tunes, but no full quantitative study has yet to be carried out regarding video games.” He’s been playing a decidedly un-fiendish mixture of games, including Kena: Bridge of Spirits, Dungeons of hinterberg, rattling through boomer shooter Bloodhound and the original Breath of Fire, and finally made a start on Spider-Man 2, since it was taking up SSD space on his PS5.</p>
<p>There was a little tickle of Destiny 2 for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, of course, but he also finished off RoboCop: Rogue City, “and it was exactly what a RoboCop game should be, including rescuing cats. It’s not a perfect game, but it’s the perfect RoboCop game.” Meanwhile, his favourite devil-y thing is Lucifer the TV series: “One of the best TV police procedurals every created but with added demons and angels. Also Exploding Kitterns on Netflix which has lots of demons but also God is voiced by Tom Ellis. aka Lucifer from Lucifer.&nbsp; So he’s played both sides, ahem.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> favourite cult is the one from Hot Fuzz, but has he taken that “greater good” ethos across to his week of gaming? Not really. He played Red Dead Redemption 2, “which continues to try and make me not love it”, and then set foot into Mount and Blade Bannerlord, albeit with cheats on just so he could survive.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> crammed in as much gaming as possible this week with a twosome of continuing his Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough with a stealthy Netrunner, and reinstalling For Honor to get his fix of hero battlers while waiting for Concord to release later this month.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with <strong>Miguel</strong> who’s been playing one of those 90s games that would’ve had your gran clutching her pearls for fear that your computer was actually filled with the Dark Lord’s minions – “I’m playing the new co-op Doom 1+2 re-release because I LOVE (killing) DEMONS AAAA 666!!!!!”</p>
<p><em>And with that, what have you played this week? Feel free to share your own devilish delights.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216887/intel-13th-14th-gen-raptor-lake-statement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Intel has a big update on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216305/intel-13th-14th-gen-raptor-lake-cpu-crash-news-updates-patches-fixes-motherboards">crashing 13th and 14th Gen desktop CPUs</a> — including a hint that maybe, just maybe, it might be able to do something about chips that are already failing instead of requiring you to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">return them</a>. </p><p>You can read its statement below in full, but here are the parts I find interesting:</p><p>Note: We still do not yet have an official answer on whether Raptor Lake laptop chips are vulnerable to the instability issues.</p><div><blockquote><p>Intel is currently distributing to its OEM/ODM partners a new microcode patch (0x129) for its Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors which will address incorrect voltage requests to the processor that are causing elevated operating voltage.</p><p><strong>For all Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processor users:&nbsp;</strong>This patch is being distributed via BIOS update and will not be available through operating system updates. Intel is working with its partners to ensure timely validation and rollout of the BIOS update for systems currently in service.</p><p><strong>Instability Analysis Update – Microcode Background and Performance Implications</strong></p><p>In addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">extended warranty coverage</a>, Intel has released three mitigations related to the instability issue – commonly experienced as consistent application crashes and repeated hangs – to help stabilize customer systems with Intel Core 13th and 14th gen desktop processors:</p><p>1. Intel default settings to avoid elevated power delivery impact to the processor (May 2024)</p><p>2. Microcode 0x125 to fix the eTVB issue in i9 processors (June 2024)</p><p>3. Microcode 0x129 to address elevated voltages (August 2024)</p><p>Intel’s current analysis finds there is a significant increase to the minimum operating voltage (Vmin) across multiple cores on affected processors due to elevated voltages. Elevated voltage events can accumulate over time and contribute to the increase in Vmin for the processor.</p><p>The latest microcode update (0x129) will limit voltage requests above 1.55V as a preventative mitigation for processors not experiencing instability symptoms. This latest microcode update will primarily improve operating conditions for K/KF/KS processors. Intel is also confirming, based on extensive validation, all future products will not be affected by this issue.</p><p>Intel is continuing to investigate mitigations for scenarios that can result in Vmin shift on potentially impacted&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors</a>. Intel will provide updates by end of August.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel’s internal testing – utilizing Intel Default Settings - indicates performance impact is within run-to-run variation (eg. 3DMark: Timespy, WebXPRT 4, Cinebench R24, Blender 4.2.0) with a few sub-tests showing moderate impacts (WebXPRT Online Homework; PugetBench GPU Effects Score). For gaming workloads tested, performance has also been within run-to-run variation (eg. Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Warhammer III – Mirrors of Madness) with one exception showing slightly more impact (Hitman 3: Dartmoor). However, system performance is dependent on configuration and several other factors.</p><p>For unlocked Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, this latest microcode update (0x129) will&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>prevent users from overclocking if they so choose. Users can disable the eTVB setting in their BIOS if they wish to push above the 1.55V threshold. As always, Intel recommends users proceed with caution when overclocking their desktop processors, as overclocking may void their warranty and/or affect system health. As a general best practice, Intel recommends customers with Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors utilize&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807">the Intel Default Settings</a>.</p><p>In light of the recently announced&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">extended warranty program</a>, Intel is reaffirming its confidence in its products and is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. Users experiencing consistent instability symptoms should reach out to their system manufacturer (OEM/System Integrator purchase), Intel Customer Support (boxed processor), or place of purchase (tray processor) further assistance.</p><p><strong>FURTHER READING:</strong></p><p><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/June-2024-Guidance-regarding-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-K-KF/m-p/1607807">June 2024 Intel Default Settings Guidance</a></p><p><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853">August 2024 Warranty Extension Details</a></p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The weekend bears down on us like a host of hissing, barrel-throwing psychics, but there is yet time for some brief updates on Remedy's Control 2, which Remedy say is coming along nicely. The same is apparently true of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-second-very-tiny-look-at-remedys-co-op-control-spin-off">the multiplayer Control spin-off Project Condor</a> and the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developers Rockstar.</p><!--more-->
<p>As passed on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/max-payne-1-2-remakes-are-in-full-production-control-2-is-now-in-a-playable-state/">VGC</a>, Remedy reveal in their latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">financial report</a> that Control 2 has "progressed to the production readiness stage", following the delivery of "a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form". They're now "scaling up" for full production. Teaser trailer with target visuals anytime, Remedy. I have yet to hear a telekinesis sound effect as gratifying as the one in Control. </p>
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, too, has "progressed from production readiness to the full production stage". According to Remedy, the development team is currently working towards a version of the game that is playable from beginning to end. As for Condor - in which you seemingly join a scrappy group of federal agents, marooned within the Oldest House - "the development team has worked on multiple maps and different mission types, and we have organized a growing amount of internal and limited external playtesting for feature validation and feedback."</p>
<p>In February this year, Remedy acquired the rights to the Control franchise from 505 Games, giving them sovereign say over how and when Control games get published. Remedy also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-and-tencents-co-op-multiplayer-game-kestrel-has-been-cancelled">cancelled a Tencent collaboration codenamed Kestrel in May</a>, freeing up resources and people for their existing franchises.</p>
<p>Since then, the latest financial release explains, they've been "weighing self-publishing and related business models, as well as discussing different partner publishing opportunities" for both Control and the Alan Wake series. We can apparently expect to hear more "towards the end of the year". Here's my pitch for the future of Control: make a spin-off series based on CTRL+ keyboard shortcuts. CTRL+F could be a detective simulation, for example, while CTRL+O could be an open worlder, and CTRL-Alt-Delete is a special minigame I play with Alan Wake 2 as and when the raytracing gives my PC a seizure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>, the mega-powered hack-and-slash action platformer that will kill you, <em>a lot</em>, offering you the tremendous satisfaction of mastery as you eventually learn its perils and emerge victorious. And there’s <em>Abathor</em>, a somewhat less grueling (though by no means easy) barbarian side-scroller in which up to four players can tackle an epic journey across its dozens of increasingly wild and inventive stages.

However, as the epic journey went on and on (and on), that disappointment gradually shifted to enthusiasm and awe as <em>Abathor </em>became more epic and crazed. In the days since, he has repeatedly gushed about how incredible the game finally becomes. I actually stopped watching his <em>Abathor </em>stream before he got too far, having decided that I wanted to experience its surprises for myself.

So many of these entries I write are more wish than fact. They’re the games I <em>wish</em> I were going to be playing this weekend. And were life more generous, I totally would be! Sometimes I even do. But also, I have a child, and it needs to be taken to its swimming lesson at 9.15 a.m. Saturday, and then to its tennis club at 11, and then demands to be entertained in some manner throughout the afternoon, and by the time I’ve cooked dinner (chicken curry this Saturday) and got the smaller human to bed, the adult human demands I sit with her and watch shit on the TV. Then much the same for Sunday.</p><p>So, if a magic time fairy magically gives me an expanse of child-free time this weekend, I would really like to play <em>Cat Quest III</em>. Admittedly I’ve yet to get very far with <em>Cat Quest II</em>, having completed the first game last year, but still, it looks lovely. I want to be playing that. —<strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1367079c813f54f41bf85fb0f73560f7" data-recommend-id="image://1367079c813f54f41bf85fb0f73560f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Balloon arch!

If you’ve been through the kind of experience you know is going to fuck up your nervous system for several months to a year, you know that there’s a lot of built up emotional anguish that can sometimes feel impossible to get out.<br></p><p>So my plan this weekend is to induce a full-blown cry by getting back to <em>1000xResist</em>. I’ve unfortunately neglected the game for a few weeks, as I’ve gotten pulled around by other responsibilities. But the dystopian adventure game has already hit me in the gut multiple times just in its early chapters.

It seems like it’s genuinely one of the best games ever, but I wouldn’t know since I’ve hardly played it. I’ve restarted it a few times across a few different platforms and I just <em>can’t</em> stick with it. Maybe it’s that I’m burnt out, but it’s absolutely impossible for me to conceive of sitting down anytime soon and sinking a hefty amount of time into anything, let alone <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><p>However, as sure as the drop in the weather and the changing of the color of the leaves, the fall season always makes me crave a deep RPG to sink my teeth into while I melt into my couch or bed.

It’s still a lot of fun taking a small squad of robots into a hideout, killing everything in sight, and then stealing the loot before you get shot to shreds by overwhelming waves of reinforcements.

I’m not sure I’d have downloaded and played it, but after reading his review and other people’s thoughts on the game, I was curious. The pitch that it’s a PS2-like action-strategy game with simple base building and fun <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>-like combat intrigued me.<br></p><p>Since starting the game, I’ve been hooked. It’s not the best-looking game ever made, nor is it the most advanced thing I’ve ever played, but it does remind me of the random PS2 games I’d play back in the day. Back when I’d stroll through my local Blockbuster, looking for something new while my parents picked out a movie. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is the kind of game I’d see a few times over the course of a month or two, but never pick it up. Finally, I’d give it a shot probably because the games I wanted that week were already rented. And it was these random games that would sometimes blow me away. I can imagine a much younger Zack falling in love with this weird game about protecting a goddess and saving villages on a mountain. He’d get a kick out of it, even if he could barely pronounce most of the enemy names in it. —<strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a fairly balanced roll of the Exotic, with intellect being the only disappointment here. If your current Getaway Artist gauntlets are lacking in certain categories, this one is worth picking up for marginally better stats overall.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 11</li><li

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

It almost implies we ought to know who Frank Stone is, or why his "casting" (whatever that means in this context) is notable. But after playing the game's prologue, I still feel out of the loop. Supermassive, famous for cinematic horror games such as Until Dawn, The Quarry, and The Dark Pictures Anthology, has been handed the reins to Behaviour Interactive's Dead By Daylight (DBD) franchise for a cinematic spin-off that plays much like its other popular games.</p><p dir="ltr">That's an exciting prospect in itself. Supermassive's playable horror movies routinely make for terrific party games. But my prevailing impression after an hour with the game is that DBD fans will get more out of this than those who come in without knowing the PvP horror game well, but also that such an arrangement actually seems okay for both groups.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Casting Of Frank Stone | Official Story Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It would be self-defeating to make a horror game intended for general fans but write its story in such a way that it's impenetrable to anyone but fans of its source material. I don't feel that's what is going on in the case of Frank Stone. However, the demo I played contains a handful of moments where I couldn't tell if what was happening was mysterious to <em>everyone</em> who may play, or just those who haven't jumped into DBD.</p><p dir="ltr">I've not spent enough time with it to consider myself an expert, but I happen to enjoy DBD. My dabbling with the game also means I'm not very caught up on the lore. It speaks of an Entity that inhabits the bodies of various killers over many years, and this story conceit is also why DBD enjoys the unique position of being Spooky Fortnite, as I call it, with a plethora of horror icons like Ghostface and the Xenomorph supplementing a roster that features a ton of original monstrosities, none of whom, however, are Frank Stone.</p><p dir="ltr">One popular theory in the DBD community is that Frank Stone is the first person to become possessed by this Entity, and so in playing The Casting of Frank Stone, Dead By Daylight fans will get to witness a prequel to all they've seen in Behaviour's mainline game. But if you're among the uninitiated, I don't think there's any reason to worry. For you, like the demo was for me, The Casting of Frank Stone may just be an intriguing supernatural horror story--no strings attached, and no homework required.</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring the demo, I did see at least one definitive DBD Easter egg in the form of a doll resembling one of the game's killers, but if anything else was directly tied to the game, it went over my head--or was perhaps shrouded in darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">But the story beats, as best I can tell, don't <em>require </em>any additional reading. The demo takes place decades ago in the fictional Cedar Hills, Oregon, and casts players as a young cop investigating the disappearance of a little boy. That brings him to a steel mill and in the presence of a strange old man and his dog, who guard the place overnight. As the officer explores the mill, players will solve minor environmental puzzles and choose dialogue options, which in turn shape his relationship with the caretaker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4348042-img_7_frank_stone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4348042-img_7_frank_stone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348042"></a><figcaption>Meet Frank Stone, whose violent backstory will drive the game forward for DBD fans and newcomers alike.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4348042-img_7_frank_stone.jpg"></figure><p>Players will also find lore items that expand on the story and perform frequent quicktime events (QTEs), which have been given a clever audiovisual makeover to look just like DBD's skill checks. As mentioned, the demo serves as a prologue, and so these characters won't be the ones players control in the bulk of the full game, but it allows for a kind of tutorial while also setting up the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Failing QTEs early on in Supermassive games can result in minor penalties, like a character tripping over themselves. But as the game goes on, failing these button presses, or making the wrong decision in the game's twisting, choose-your-own-adventure narrative can often result in playable characters being killed off permanently. From a gameplay standpoint, Frank Stone is as familiar to Supermassive's returning players as it is simple enough to learn if you are new to the developer's catalog.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of my time with the demo saw me fend off an attack from a killer, presumably our titular villain, before a gruesome death occurred. As the camera panned back slowly, either unveiling some clue that was lost to me or just being generally cinematic in the way Supermassive often is--I can't say for sure--I found myself wondering if I would recognize the setting if I were a bigger DBD fan, but I also felt like it didn't ultimately matter. Surely even DBD obsessives aren't intended to understand the game's story after one chapter, so if this dramatic shot meant a bit more to them than it did to me, I'm cool with that.</p><p dir="ltr">For me, Frank Stone may be the latest spooky romp through an interactive movie in which all of the playable characters can die (or live) by the end of the game, depending on my decisions. That's a formula that I love returning to every time, even as the end results surely vary. For bigger Dead By Daylight fans, there's certainly an additional layer to enjoy, perhaps creating new DBD fans too--which is the point, of course. But what both groups have in common is its central mystery: Who is Frank Stone and, furthermore, why is he homicidal?</p><p dir="ltr">These disparate groups of players may have different motives, but they're largely asking the same questions, and if the game can satisfyingly answer those questions, Supermassive will have its next hit on its hands, while Behaviour may have a new path to expanding its already-impressive horror universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Casting of Frank Stone launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and at $40 (or $50 for the Deluxe Edition), may be cheaper than you're expecting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/boyfriend-netflix-terrace-house-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been four years since the cancellation of <em>Terrace House</em>, a Japanese reality show that felt like the realest thing on TV until...<a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20191024/p2a/00m/0na/015000c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it turned out it was anything but</a>. Between the reckoning over those revelations and the absence of the program itself, it's been a long, cold four years for fans of the series.</p><p>I'm one of those fans, and I'll be honest with you up top here:<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/5/21273888/terrace-house-death-hana-kimura-what-happened-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> despite everything we learned in the wake of the show's cancellation, from the manipulation of the "plot" to the conditions its stars were forced to live under--which culminated in <em>the death of a participant</em>, Hana Kimura</a>--a part of me (a very small, selfish part) still missed the show and wanted it back. I didn't want it to come back in the same broken ways of course, changes would have to be made, but I loved the core premise of <em>Terrace House</em> so much that I figured it was only a matter of time until it found a way to retool itself and return to the airwaves.</p><p>As the years went by, though, and it became clear <em>Terrace House's</em> multiple failures and their tragic consequences had made the brand radioactive, regardless of anything it ever did <em>right</em>, I think most fans--myself included--had made peace with the fact the show had existed, run its course, fucked things up and was now part of TV history. Until, out of nowhere, along came <em>The Boyfriend</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Boyfriend | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VS2gv--0Pug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This show's marketing has been <em>very </em>careful with how it pitches the program. It has rightly been hailed as a triumph of inclusivity in its native Japan, as it's the first <em>ever </em>gay dating show to air in the country, and the way it's able to depict same-sex relationships as something totally normal and not some exotic spectacle is a triumph of both its setup and its production. <em>The Boyfriend </em>has been sold as a pioneering dating show, which in one way is exactly what it is, and <a href="https://macaonews.org/news/around-the-world/japan-the-boyfriend-netflix-lgbtq-same-sex-dating-show/#:~:text=Japan's%20first%20same%2Dsex%20dating%20show%20is%20winning%20over%20international%20viewers&amp;text=Japan's%20first%2Dever%20same%2Dsex,on%20a%20well%2Dworn%20format." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been a huge success as a result</a>.</p><p>But let's be real: as you could probably tell just by watching the trailer above, <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/movies-tv/the-boyfriend-premieres-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is <em>Terrace House </em>rebranded</a>. This is the successor show fans have been waiting years for. Just like <em>Terrace House</em>, <em>The Boyfriend </em>is about a group of singles tossed into a fancy AirBnB, where they have to juggle work and play, form friendships, find love and be on camera the whole time they're doing it. The events are even narrated by a studio panel, which--in case you were still on the fence after everything I just described--includes <em>Terrace House</em> veteran Yoshimi Tokui.</p><p>Yet for all its similarities, <em>The Boyfriend</em> also has some key differences that were surely implemented to avoid the show repeating <em>Terrace House's</em> mistakes. Its stars were only thrown into a house for a month, not <em>months</em>. There were less people in the house, everybody was given their own private bedroom, drinking appeared to be far less common and most plotlines seemed to be driven out in the open instead of behind the scenes, since stars were repeatedly sent out on work assignments (basically day-long dates) together, and were filmed the entire time.</p><p>These changes had an effect on what we saw and enjoyed as voyeurs, of course. Everything in <em>The Boyfriend </em>feels tamer and more reserved than <em>Terrace House</em>; the show lacks any real scandal, its smaller cast means there are fewer plotlines to follow and its brevity means there's only a limited rotation of participants. The whole show feels like a shareware version of <em>Terrace House</em>, a replica scale model, ostensibly the same thing, but also greatly reduced.</p><figure><figcaption>I will not spoil it, but these chicken breasts were the highlight of the show for me</figcaption></figure><p>And that's great? Because let's get a grip, for everything fans loved about <em>Terrace House</em>, a lot of that drama came from a very fucked up place, and it led to some very real and tragic consequences. If what people enjoyed about <em>Terrace House</em> was how real it felt, how chill and relatable everyone's interactions appeared to be compared to the bombast and psycho-competitiveness of Western reality shows, then surely you'll enjoy it even more if those interactions are...more real?</p><p>I'm not saying this show has improved the <em>Terrace House</em> formula in a way that can shield it from future controversy, nor can I be some kind of guarantor that every single thing you see in the series is free from the manipulation of producers and camera operators. This is, after all, a reality TV show designed for entertainment, not a documentary. But huge stretches of <em>The</em> <em>Boyfriend </em>take place in a kind of haze, where everyone just hangs out and not much happens, relationships spark then fizzle, and while this initially feels like a disappointment as a <em>viewer</em>, that's also just how life is. It's boring, and awkward, and if the appeal of <em>Terrace House</em> was seeing that kind of stuff play out on your TV screen, please know that <em>The Boyfriend </em>does much the same thing.</p><p>Just this time around, it's (hopefully) doing it in a safer way.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arkadium-launches-new-publishing-arm/</link>

			<p>Arkadium is an online games platform known for creating casual web browser games such as Mahjong, Bubble Shooters, and Crosswords. They have now launched a publishing service for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-1440p-resolution-and-120-fps-gameplay-for-pc-users-adds-six-new-games/">browser games</a>.</p>
<p>By doing this, they offer third-party publishing to browser-based developers, following their successful developer program, which opened in April. In addition to the third-party publishing, they have established a new $1 million fund to help developers and provide them with the resources needed to work on their projects.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, Arkadium has also announced that they have teamed up with Sony Pictures Entertainment to release an official Who Wants To Be A Billionaire? video game. In addition to the Who Wants To Be A Billionaire video game, they have announced six new titles being released under the new publishing arm.</p>
<p>This includes Categories and Room Escapes by Article 19, Element Blocks and Zoo Boom by Famobi, Multiplayer Chess Online by Foony and Ridella by Dylan Kappor.</p>
<p>Arkadium released a statement alongside this announcement: "Our new Arkadium publishing initiative builds on our 'Arkadium for Developers' program with even more support for game developers to succeed on browser," stated Arkadium's Director of Developer Relations, Dan Butchko.</p>
<p>"This is the next step in our continuing growth as the leader of the browser-based game sector as we build the world's best gaming platform alongside some of the most innovative and passionate game creators."</p>
<p>Browser games are often used by those who don't have access to a full gaming PC or those who are in school and use browser games to avoid doing their work. They are utilized in many situations, and Arkadium's opening up its company to third-party developers is a great sign of things to come for browser games. The firm offers a 75% revenue share model, with game creators all over the globe being allowed to submit their games to the Arkadium for Developers program.</p>
<p>Utilizing the<a href="https://corporate.arkadium.com/newsroom/arkadium-opens-its-vast-distribution-network-to-developers-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Arkadium for Developers</a> program, they hope to release 30 new titles over 2024, using the new initiative well.</p>

            <p>
Remedy Entertainment has released its latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">half-year financial report</a>, detailing progress on some of its most anticipated titles - with its Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake confirmed to have entered full production, while "important" Control 2 features are now in "playable form".
</p>
<p>
Remedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-in-the-works-remedy-confirms">confirmed it was remaking cult-classic slo-mo shooters Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a> back in 2022 as part of a collaboration with Rockstar, and the studio has sporadically offered updates since then. Last October brought the news the project had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-2-still-in-proof-of-concept-stage-as-max-payne-remake-enters-production-readiness">entered "production readiness"</a>, and things are now a further step closer to release as the game moves to "full production".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Remedy says the development team "has been working towards developing the game to an early functional state from beginning to end."
</p>

<p>
Live-service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-details-control-live-service-multiplayer-spin-off">Control spin-off</a> Condor, now the only multiplayer game in the works at Remedy following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-developer-cancels-premium-co-op-multiplayer-codename-kestrel-despite-early-promise">cancellation of Codename Kestrel</a> earlier this year, has also reached full production, with "multiple maps and different mission types" in development. Remedy adds it's been stepping up its internal and limited external testing "for feature validation and feedback."
</p>
<p>
As for Control 2, the sequel to 2019's acclaimed weird office shooter, that's not at quite such an advanced stage. Right now, it's in "production readiness", and the team is said to have reached an key milestone in "delivering a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form". Remedy is working towards scaling up production on the project, with "business negotiations" continuing.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in Remedy world, Alan Wake 2 still hasn't sold enough copies to begin generating royalties for Remedy despite launching to significant critical acclaim, but the studio notes it's now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses". It also highlights "excellent" press reviews and fan feedback for this year's Night Springs expansion, and points toward the physical edition of Alan Wake 2 arriving this October.
</p>
<p>
That coincides with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-expansions-detailed-include-trip-inside-fictional-tv-show">Alan Wake 2's second DLC</a>, The Lake House, which sees players exploring a "mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organisation to conduct secret research... until something goes wrong".

But more interestingly, this recently released port adds full mod support to all platforms, letting anyone upload custom maps and mods to be played on Xbox and PlayStation. And uh, people are going wild with this feature, adding famous maps like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/b2Hx8RGxiPI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/b2Hx8RGxiPI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuts.wad,</a></span> and a ton of IP-infringing mods that might not stick around long. </p><p>On Thursday, after work, I booted up the new<em> Doom + Doom II </em>port on my Xbox Series X and started checking out the mods that people had uploaded. At first, it was just a few things like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/sigil-ii&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/sigil-ii">Romero’s <em>SIGIL 2</em></a></span> and <em>Harmony</em>. Cool stuff, for sure, but nothing <em>too </em>weird. </p><p>But by the end of the night, I found a <em>Super Mario Bros </em>mod, multiple uploads of <em>Hexen</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-2-free-mods-myhouse-download-gzdoom-goty-1850616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-2-free-mods-myhouse-download-gzdoom-goty-1850616515">the creepy (and recently created) myhouse.wad</a></span>, a few versions of nuts.wad, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.org/details/harrisdoom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.org/details/harrisdoom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a controversial map pack created</a></span> by one of the Columbine shooters. Someone has also uploaded a working version of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/NysJBmCVNJw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/NysJBmCVNJw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imp Encounter</a></span>,” aka the <em>Doom </em>map that infamously ends with the Doomguy having sex with an Imp enemy. So that’s now playable on Xbox, which is something I never expected.</p><p>As of Friday morning, all of these mods are still available to play on my Xbox. Just a few minutes ago, I booted up the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/116454-mariodoompk3-vanilla-edition-unofficial-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/116454-mariodoompk3-vanilla-edition-unofficial-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super Mario Bros </em>mod</a></span>, which swaps out enemies, weapons, and sound effects from <em>Doom </em>with stuff from the Nintendo franchise. It’s pretty well-made and has been floating around the web since the early 2000s. </p><p>Another I checked out isn’t as well made and features <em>Simpsons </em>characters replacing demons. I’m not sure Nintendo or Disney will be happy to see either of these mods playable on Xbox or PlayStation. I have to assume that Bethesda is going to sweep through these mods soon and start removing some of this stuff. </p><p>To be clear, I don’t want that to happen. <em>Doom </em>modding has a long history of taking other franchises and characters and cramming them into the classic FPS. Some of the best and most-played mods in history mix and match different IPs in silly ways. It’s a core part of <em>Doom </em>modding. </p><p>But, I also expect Bethesda doesn’t want to upset any other companies or risk a lawsuit, so I doubt these mods survive for long. But hey, if you are quick enough, you can download some and check them out on Xbox or PlayStation and have some fun before the lawyers ruin everything. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-to-expect-the-next-college-football-25-title-updates/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>College Football 25 just received its second title update of the year — the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-gets-first-major-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major one</a>, however — on Thursday, August 8. Of course, that won’t be the last major update to come to the first college football game in 11 years.</p>



<p>While EA Sports hasn’t confirmed when future title updates are coming, we do have an idea thanks to a <a href="https://x.com/trayj08/status/1821684374435217857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter post</a> from the Virginia Cavaliers deputy athletics director Tyler Jones.</p>







<p>According to Jones, who spoke with EA about updates to Virginia’s stadium in the game, College Football 25’s third title update is “scheduled 45 days after the original launch”. That would put the release around August 29, just before the start of the real college football season.</p>



<p>He then mentioned the fifth title update, which is scheduled for 90 days after launch. That would put it around October 17 if it remains on schedule.</p>



<p>Based on the timeline Jones gave in his post, College Football 25 should receive five title updates within the first three months. It’s unlikely that any future updates will be as large in scale as August 8th’s, but it’s still nice to know what a tentative schedule is like. Also, there will continue to be various small patches in between the larger title updates as issues arise that need urgent addressing.</p>



<p>College Football 25 is available now for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Such heroes include Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Piccolo, Krillin, Android 18, and Majin Buu. The will also feature series villains spanning Dragon Ball’s mythos like Cooler from Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball Super’s Zamasu and Vermoud. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DRAGON BALL PROJECT : Multi (@db_prjmulti) <a href="https://twitter.com/db_prjmulti/status/1821458190728626634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>According to its <a href="https://dbpm.bn-ent.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a>, the game will be playable on Google Play, The App Store, and Steam. Along with Dragon Ball Project: Multi’s reveal, the company also announced its regional beta test, which will last from August 20 to September 3. </p><p>Like any MOBA, Dragon Ball Project: Multi will require players to conquer enemy objectives by organizing a well-rounded team comprised of tanks, support, and damage characters. The game will also offer customization options, allowing players to swap skins, entrance, and finisher animations.

Zero’s release on October 11, Dragon Ball Project: Multi has the latent potential to be a refreshing new game for players to test their Z-fighter battle senses.   </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

                <p>Disney might be getting its own dedicated store within Fortnite, and it could be announced very soon.</p><p>A leaked image has surfaced online showing what appears to be a separate store section for Disney and Marvel skins that Fortnite has had thus far. The reason for Disney and Epic for going down this route is unclear, but it's possible that due to the many collaborations between them, perhaps they wanted to make their skins more readily available.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1821930442758733912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1821930442758733912%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">RUMOR: FIRST LOOK AT AN UPCOMING DISNEY ITEM SHOP 🔥<br>This image was sent to <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HYPEX</a> &amp; me earlier today.

Coincidentally, Fortnite is making a big change to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">battle-pass structure</a>. Starting with the upcoming Chapter 5 Season 4 battle pass, items will not be exclusive to the season they belong to.</p><p>Additionally, Disney pumped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/" data-ref-id="1100-6525584">$1.5 billion into Fortnite back in February</a>, which makes the revelation of a apparently separate store for Disney IP much more interesting.</p>
