            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-battle-of-edoras-review-horses-and-pitchforks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The clash of swords, the thunderous pounding of horses’ hooves - these of the sounds of war in the world of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And now, Games Workshop’s releasing a brand new Starter Set for their miniature wargame set in Tolkien’s universe (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-review-spring-2022-releases" rel="nofollow"><i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i></a>). Following the story of the upcoming animated feature film, GW sent along a copy for me to review - so check out my thoughts on this epic, massive box in my <i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i> – Battle of Edoras review.</p>

<h2><b>What’s Included in the Battle of Edoras Box?</b></h2>

<p>Battle of Edoras as a Starter Set truly does contain just about everything you need to begin your journey. The official contents are:</p>

<ul><li>Haleth, Prince of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>Háma, Prince&nbsp;of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24 Rohan Warriors</li>
	<li>Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes - mounted and on foot&nbsp;</li>
	<li>General Targg - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24&nbsp;Hill Tribesmen</li>
	<li>Two Rohan Houses</li>
	<li>The full hardcover 176-page rules manual</li>
	<li>48-page scenario and profiles booklet</li>
	<li>Double-sided 3’x3’ playmat, two reference guides, a range ruler, and 12 dice</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, this is a truly robust starter set, which you'd expect to see for its $220 USD MSRP. Now let's get into the box contents, the new rules of the game, and more!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=G6ScBJtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=Uduml4Vd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan square off against the Hill Tribesman in this epic showdown, featuring terrain from Battle Systems.</figcaption></figure><h2><b>How Does It Play/New Rules</b></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-us/articles/2ifuwrwc/middle-earthtm-strategy-battle-game-key-changes-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">official article breaking down many of the larger changes</a> to the new set should serve as a go-to resource for tracking everything this new edition brings, but to quickly run through the details:</p>

<h3>New Profiles Break Things Up, Simplify</h3>

<p>Each and every character and unit in the game has undergone a significant change to their profiles. Some of these changes include new and different abilities, special gear, etc., while other changes are foundational to the very construction of the profile itself.</p>

<p>For instance, Courage is now a target number to beat, vs. a static ability. And the Shoot Value and Fight Value have been broke up into their own categories, which all just serve to simplify the process. In my opinion, <i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> has always been on the crunchier side of things - and there are still charts to consult based on the strength of weapons, etc. - but the changes here do hint at making the game more approachable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=o9z_MXci 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=Do4oxLLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan clash with General Targg and Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes. Image: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure><h3>Intelligence Hints At Narrative Moments</h3>

<p>There’s a new stat on the profile of all units and characters: the Intelligence stat! This stat feels like a flexible stat that can be used in a variety of ways throughout the gameplay. For instance, the rulebook presents two opportunities: in one, a character is trying to free a relic from the ground and must pass an Intelligence check. In the other, Frodo’s been attacked by a special power from the Nazgul that forces him to make an Intelligence test to avoid being affected by it.</p>

<p>Here’s why I love this new addition, I think it truly does a lot of work to add the potential for narrative moments into the game. For a wargame based on some of the best storytelling of the twentieth century, it can sometimes feel like - aside from warriors squaring off 1v1 - it’s light on narrative touches. But now, with Intelligence, there’s so much open room in abilities, narrative play scenarios, and more to add even more storytelling moments and flourishes.</p>

<p>Beyond these two major changes, there are small tweaks and what I would call “quality of life improvements” to be found across the ruleset. Nothing here is earthshakingly different from the previous edition, but it feels very tightened up and tidy.</p>

<h3><b>The Models Included In The Battle for Edoras Box</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=JNUICBNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=M530e8q9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The princes of Rohan are shown here, both mounted and unmounted, in front of Battle Systems scenic terrain.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point - fair warning - there might be some slight spoilers for <i>The War of the Rohirrim</i> - at least in the fact that character’s crucial to the film will be discussed here. Nothing major, but worth shouting out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The models included in the box feel very evenly balanced against one another, with all four good and evil heroes shining in their own light. To start, there’s Haleth, Prince of Rohan. He’s a strong fighter with three attacks, and comes mounted on an armored horse, and his special ability allows him to re-roll failed Wound rolls when he’s outnumbered.</p>

<p>Next up is Haleth’s brother, Háma, Prince of Rohan. He’s equipped with a bow, hand weapons, and is an expert rider on his mount. Though he only has two attacks, his special ability allows him to spend Will Points to allow nearby Rohan warriors to re-roll Wound Rolls of 1.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=5QHVwPSQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=qBAU-yP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Evil Heroes, Wulf and General Targg, are seen here mounted and unmounted in front of Battle Systems terrain pieces.</figcaption></figure><p>On the evil side, there’s Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes, who is also a strong fighter with three attacks, comes mounted, and can re-roll a single D6 during the duel roll (and <i>must</i> re-roll To Wound Rolls of natural 1 against an enemy Hero).</p>

<p>Alongside him is General Targg, a strong fighter with the Master of Battle ability (which lets him copy another friendly hero’s Heroic Action on a roll of 4+), and a more strategic ability that allows other friendly Dunland Warrior models near him to re-roll To Wound rolls of 1 if you’ve given priority to your opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=LvmBks9O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=FJk_h4LJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battle of Edoras Rohan Warriors on display</figcaption></figure><p>The additional Rohan Warriors and Hill Tribesman are also fun, if standard, additions to the kit - and make up the great bulk of the forces. Rohan has armor, and the Hill Tribesman can bring flaming brands (which are pretty potent weapons with the Terror (Cavalry) and Terror (Beast) abilities). Overall, as you might expect, the Rohan Warriors have slightly better defense, and they also have a better Intelligence Score.</p>

<h2><b>The Look of the Models of Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>The models included in this set all look really nice. While the Rohan Warriors are fairly standard in terms of their design and sculpt, I like the look of them all on foot. When I get these painted up in their traditional Rohan colors, I think they’re really going to stand out with their uniform design and long, pointed spears.</p>

<p>Contrasting them nicely is the chaotic look of the Hill Tribesman. With burning brands, pitchforks, and other improvised weapons, and with all of their models sculpted to look like they’re mid-run, there’s a kind of wild energy to these models that I really like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman-sprue.jpeg?itok=zw28w7lk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman-sprue.jpeg?itok=9ucdDEh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image of the sprue for the Hill Tribesman from Battle for Edoras, including lots of different rough-hewn weapon options.</figcaption></figure><p>Constructing these models, and the Rohan houses included in the kit, is a bit finicky. That’s my biggest (and really only) complaint with this set - there’s so much gluing of tiny pieces - in a way that feels a little outdated. I shouldn’t have to glue the front of a models face to the back of their head in the year of our Ilúvatar 2024.</p>

<h2><b>Special Note: Easy Rohan Terrain Perfect for Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>I also wanted to take a moment here before the end of the review to make a special callout for one of my all-time favorite terrain solutions, <a href="https://battlesystems.co.uk/product-category/terrain/fantasy/" rel="nofollow">Battle Systems Fantasy Terrain</a>, because it fits so perfectly with the look, feel, and theme of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>War of the Rohirim. </i>This hard cardboard terrain, which comes pre-printed with lush imagery, snaps together easily, is highly modular, and takes a fraction of the time to set up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=DnL55YtR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=6vbo-jZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This setpiece from the Fantasy Village Battle Systems terrain kit adds some verticality and vivid design to the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Whenever I’m playing a skirmish wargame like <i>MeSBG</i>, <i>Frostgrave</i>, and <i>Warcry</i>, etc. I’m almost always reaching for this terrain vs. heavier plastic options. And while the terrain you see in my photos is from the Fantasy Village and Ruined Settlement kits, the set that really would be a one-to-one match for Rohan is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/battle-systems-northern-settlement-and-ruined-monastery-preview" rel="nofollow">Northern Settlement set, which TechRaptor’s own Adam Potts reviewed a few years back</a>.</p>

<p>These pieces are obviously not part of this Starter Set (which comes with sprues for two Rohan Houses - I’ve only built the one so far), but I thought they deserved a callout here for anyone interested in getting into <i>War of the Rohirrim</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=f6PaWl7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=OhPL3yiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Hill Tribesmen bring a ferociousness to the battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h2><b><i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i></b><b> – Battle of Edoras - Final Thoughts</b></h2>

<p>There’s no other way of putting it - this Starter Kit is a masterpiece and a must-have for newcomers hoping to get into Games Workshop’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> miniature game. Battle of Edoras is such a hugely robust kit, with over fifty models, to large buildings, the entire core rulebook in hardcover, and more.</p>

<p>The gameplay has been nicely streamlined in ways, though this still isn’t even as simple as <i>Age of Sigmar</i> (which of course has its own moments of crunchiness). So while brand new newcomers to wargaming might feel a bit stumped by the ruleset here and the intricacy of constructing these models, anyone familiar with wargaming at all will fall right in with this Starter Set.</p>

And speaking of expansions, <em>The Storybook Vale</em> hasn’t shied away from adding a wide variety of new meals and new ingredients to make them. One of these ingredients—Salt Crystals— can seem a bit elusive at first, but it’s really not that hard to find.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That being said, obtaining a full stack of Salt Crystals can be a bit time-consuming, so we’ll tell you where to find this ingredient in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and how to stock up on it faster.</p><h2 id="h3689"><a id="location"></a>Where To Find Salt Crystals In <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>If you’ve glanced at Salt Crystals in your collection menu, you’ve no doubt seen that it lists all four sections from the Everafter as locations to obtain the ingredient. However, clearing the way to all of these areas doesn’t reveal anything to harvest or purchase to grant you Salt Crystals. That’s because this ingredient is, strangely, only obtained via fishing.</p><p><strong>Salt Crystals are caught by fishing in the Everafter biome</strong>. But before you go casting your lure into the colorful pools scattered through this darkly magical section of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, it’s important to remember that <strong>Salt Crystals can only be obtained by fishing outside of pools</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, this ingredient shares a spawn with fish, so not every cast will earn you a Salt Crystal. But make sure that you bring along a fishing friend so that you’ll earn a second Salt Crystal each time you fish one up. Keep at it long enough and you’ll have yourself a full stack of this spice.</p><h2 id="h3690"><a id="cook"></a>What Can You Cook With Salt Crystals?<br></h2><p>These meals all require Salt Crystals to cook to perfection: <br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A Very Unusual Tea-Time - Salt Crystal, Yogurt, Spiral Strawberry, Sour Berries</li><li>Aquatic Escargot - Salt Crystal, Trumpet Snail, Garlic</li><li>Arcane Garlic Whelk - Salt Crystal, Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab, Garlic, Any Spice</li><li>Caprese Salad - Salt Crystal, Any Vegetable, Olives, Flyleaf Feta, Any Spice</li><li>Grecian Fish Bake - Salt Crystal, Stygian Mudskipper, Elysian Grain, Olives, Ambrosia</li><li>Greek Potatoes - Salt Crystal, Potato, Garlic, Any Fruit, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Baked Sea Wolf - Salt Crystal, Sea Wolf</li><li>Salt-Pickled Cauliflower - Salt Crystal, Cauliflower, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Garlic - Salt Crystal, Garlic, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Green Bean - Salt Crystal, Green Beans, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Radicchio - Salt Crystal, Radicchio, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Radish - Salt Crystal, Radish, Any Spice</li><li>Salt-Pickled Sea Grapes - Salt Crystal, Sea Grapes, Any Spice</li><li>Shovelbird Eggs Benedict - Salt Crystal, Elysian Grain, Shovelbird Egg, Spiral, Strawberry</li><li>Soda Bread &amp; Feta - Salt Crystal, Wheat, Flyleaf Feta</li></ul><p>Granted, with <em>The Storybook Vale</em>’s second half coming at a later date, there is almost certain to be additional meals added that make use of Salt Crystals in the future.

<p>The year isn’t over yet and there are plenty of great games still set to be released before it ends. In this article, we’re bringing you the 10 most promising games of December 2024. The last month of the year can hold some good surprises and, so you don’t have to pick through them one by one, I’ve put them all in this list.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-most-promising-games-of-december-2024">10 Most Promising Games Of December 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-infinity-nikki-december-5">Infinity Nikki – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, PC, Android, iOS</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Infinity Nikki - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zP7dLsL1b6M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Infold Games, Infinity Nikki is an open-world game that follows a gacha structure similar to Genshin Impact.</p>



<p>One of the game’s main differentiators is its dress mechanic, which profoundly alters the gameplay. Some dresses allow Nikki to float, others reduce her size, others allow her to slide and so on.</p>



<p>Unlike games such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, Infinity Nikki focuses on platforming and relaxing activities such as fishing, looking after animals and collecting insects.</p>



<h3 id="h-ufl-december-5">UFL – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UFL™ Insider #7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4YFxD21q2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Popularly referred to as the “Fifa Killer”, UFL is a free soccer game that was conceived with a difficult mission: to stand up to EA Sports FC and eFootball.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-talking-ufl-with-strikerz-ceo-eugene-nashilov/">RELATED: Check our interview with Strikerz CEO, Eugene Nashilov</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not easy being the “new kid on the block” in a genre dominated by two forces. Despite the obstacles, the team is motivated to make the game succeed, attracting the attention and investment of personalities such as CR7.</p>



<h3 id="h-fantasian-neo-dimension-december-5">Fantasian Neo Dimension – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Fantasian Neo Dimension - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz37fdo_lqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension is a JRPG led by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, two names that practically solidified the genre around the world.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, Hironobu Sakaguchi is considered the father of the Final Fantasy franchise. In the story, we follow the protagonist Leo on an inter-dimensional adventure to save the Earth from Mechteria, a mechanical infection that steals the emotions and lives of humans.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force-december-5">Delta Force – December 5</h3>

<p>The console versions will arrive in early 2025. The game is being very well received by the community, featuring both PvE modes, such as the campaign that reimagines the same Black Hawk Down campaign from 2003, and PvP modes such as Havoc Warfare, where 32-player matches take place.</p>

<p>Developed by Digital Mind Games, The Spirit of the Samurai is a 2D action game made in stop motion. Yes, you didn’t get it wrong.</p>

<p>The game is heavily inspired by Japanese folklore, featuring a rich lore of the country’s mythology. In addition to Takeshi, at certain points you control Kodama, a brave spirit and Chisai, a warrior cat.</p>

<p>GOG's version goes a bit beyond the classic versions that were on sale on Blizzard.net. Beyond the broad promise that "This is the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform," GOG has made specific tweaks to the networking code for&nbsp;<em>Warcraft I</em>, and fixed up the DirectX wrapper for&nbsp;<em>Warcraft II</em> to improve its scaling on modern monitor resolutions.</p>
<p>It's quite a novel commitment, keeping non-revenue-generating games playable for buyers, even after a publisher no longer makes them available for sale. The&nbsp;Warcraft titles certainly won't be the only games for which publisher enthusiasm lags behind GOG and its classic gamers.</p>
<p>As noted at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/">Preservation Program's launch</a>, for some titles, GOG does not have the rights to modify a game's build, and only its original developers can do so. So if GOG can't make it work in, say, <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, extraordinary efforts may be required.</p>

<p>Beyond being tied to Blizzard's Battle.net service in perpetuity, there are other reasons&nbsp;<em>Warcraft </em>fans might want to hold onto the originals. Blizzard's 2020 release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/"><em>Warcraft III Reforged</em></a> was widely panned as uneven, unfinished, and in some ways unfair, as it, too, removed the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft III </em>from stores.&nbsp;<em>Reforged</em> was still in rough shape a year later, leading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-tops-our-list-of-2020s-most-disappointing-video-games/">Ars' list of 2020's most disappointing games</a>. A 2.0 update promised a total reboot, but fans remain torn on the new art styles and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-3-reforged-20-is-a-fresh-start-but-fans-remain-unconvinced-after-rocky-launch">are somewhat wary</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, you can now select more units in the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em> games' remasters, and you get "numerous visual updates for the UI."</p>

		<p>As we come to the second anniversary for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>, Fatshark has dragged their grimdark co-op shooter back from a difficult initial launch. This week sees the latest free update arrive, Grim Protocols, which kicks off a free new story arc and new Havoc endgame mode, and comes alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/warhammer-40000-darktide-washes-onto-ps5-in-december/">the PS5 launch of the game</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Havoc Endgame Mode | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUzMxKl9qqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Dark Communion mission nudges the overarching story of Darktide along, as Interrogator Rannick sends your team of misfits back to the area nicknamed the Carnival to try and figure out where Chaos-infused Tainted Stimms are coming from. As you get dropped off at a landing pad, it’s pretty damned obvious that it’s the Cathedrum that’s blanketed by a glowing green storm.</p>


<p>The Carnival first appeared as a location with The Traitor’s Curse update for the game’s first anniversary, and Dark Communion picks up on some common threads here, fighting along a different path to reach new areas added onto common spaces. It’s a great-looking location, blending together cyberpunk vibes from the red neon lights that illuminate the market place with the gothic architecture that dominates the Imperium.</p>


<p>It builds up nicely to the final battle at the Cathedrum, as you battle through barriers conjured by cultists to reach and destroy the apparatus that’s producing the tainted Stimms. It’s an abrupt ending though, and it really feels like there’s much more to come.</p>
<p>For long-time players, though, the real draw of this update will be the new Havoc game mode. Pitched as a new endgame that promises to ramp up the challenge higher and higher the more you play, it comes with new modifiers and challenges as you battle at the behest of Commisar Dukane.</p>

<p>At first it won’t necessarily be that stern of a test for you. Running our first mission saw us confronted by certain enemies having Pus-hardened Skin, making them glow green as they could soak up a bit more damage than usual, but there could also be faster-firing enemies, more highly corrupted foes, enemies with head parasites and more thanks to a handful of bespoke mutators. We actually made it through with relative ease –&nbsp;thanks in no small part by Fatshark providing us with some kitted out level 30 characters to play with on this pre-release build –&nbsp;and that gave a false sense of security when hopping back across to try a Maelstrom difficulty mission from the main mission selector… only to get absolutely stomped by multiple boss enemies appearing all at once, tough modifiers and more.</p>
<p>So Havoc starts off easier, but the idea is that it’s more of a challenge mode. As you complete a mission, your ranking increases by one, applying a new baseline difficulty but also giving you a new Havoc Assignment with a randomised mission and mutator to take on, getting incrementally more difficult each time. You can climb up through 40 levels of difficulty, but if you fail, you’ll be stuck at a particular level and can actually slide back a level if you fail three times on the trot – repeating a mission will see enemy spawns re-randomised so that even running the same mission will be a little bit different. Thankfully, assignments are remixed and doled out to the individual, so you can team up with other players or use the party finder to try and find a better configuration if yours is a real stinker (this also allows you to play at both higher and lower levels, depending on the party members).</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not just the glory of the Emperor that will be pushing you to do this. There’s new weapons in the form of the two-handed Power and Force Swords, while the Ogryn is getting a Heavy Stubber (and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/">a slightly reworked talent tree</a> that’s being reset for all players).</p>
<p>There’s also the promise of new rewards, with new Havoc-related penances to work through that can net you a Moebian 53rd black set of clothing, frames, titles, and insignia. There’s also weekly reward caches of materials and Mastery XP depending on how you do, and that ties in with a weekly reset of sorts that marks your new highwater mark of difficulty with a Havoc Clearance Level – this determines your new starting assignment, and you can be demoted if you fail to play Havoc from one week to the next.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting new mode, tapping into the need to continually remix the game’s content and provide new ways to keep players engaged once they’ve reached the limits of the main progression and unlocked all those higher tier weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>For me, though, I’ll be heading right back to the very beginning with new characters. This preview was actually my first time playing Darktide, despite it having been on my wishlist ever since launch. With two years of updates and now with the PS5 release, it’s probably in the best spot its ever been, if a bit overwhelming for newcomers to figure out where everything is in the hub area and decide which character to play as. I’m thinking a Zealot, having played here as a standard Veteran. The real question is, do I play on console or PC? And will I be in it for the long haul of levelling and gear, or a quick sprint through the loose story woven through the levels?</p>

			<p>Digital Extremes has hosted its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHoyHxbj0s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final devstream for 2024</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> was understandably the focus of the conversation. The upcoming free update will introduce a full-fledged romance system to Warframe, and Creative Director Rebecca Ford revealed that there will be two novels worth of lines dedicated to the relationship/romance via the new in-game chat system with fellow members of the Hex squad.</p>
<p><em>What we've done with Warframe: 1999 is we've basically tried to make as authentic an experience as possible which is in who are you chatting with in 1999 and how did you chat with them. It lets you connect with the Hex and learn about them, what they like, and what they don't like. It doesn't have to be romantic; you don't even have to do it at all, because the bounties will get you chemistry, but so does this system. Our goals with this system were for it to be really immersive for people who want deeper relationships with the NPCs we make. It gets you a sort of immersive and fictional and deeper way to connect. There's two novels worth of words. The count clocked in today at 166,00 words.</em></p>
<p><em>You have to kind of figure out who they are. You can ask different questions you can learn a little bit about them. For those of you who are into the more character side of our games,&nbsp; there is a bit of an endgame for this system. We're not going to talk too much about it. This isn't a system that's going to have sort of like instant gratification.</em></p>
<p>We also learned that a new 'PvPvE' mode called Faceoff will be added with Warframe: 1999. Eight players will split into two teams and run a friendly competition on opposite sides of Höllvania to take on various objectives for The Hex while fighting off endless enemy waves.</p>
<p>During the match, players can accrue points to unlock Boosts (buffs) for their team and Hindrances (debuffs) for the rival squad to get distinct advantages like guaranteed critical damage against enemies for a limited time, or even send missile strikes to bombard the other team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Digital Extremes keeps working on the base game, too. The new player experience is being improved with increased capacity for weapon and Warframe slots and the removal of cooldowns for the Master Rank Test on failed completion. In addition to reworking Trinity, Nyx will get a light rework in preparation for her Protoframe debut. Her abilities will receive a user interface visibility overhaul, Mind Control will guarantee radiation damage types, Psychic Bolts will receive two additional bolts, and her Absorb ultimate will receive an overall mobility and damage buff.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to Warframe: 1999?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-review-flawed-yet-compelling.1049856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an alternate future, former Soviet scientists inadvertently created a dangerous region filled with mutants and strange phenomena. It has been 15 years since we've last had a chance to step foot in the Zone — in this&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;review, I'll explain how GSC Game World has succeeded (and failed) at bringing this classic survival game into the modern era.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d17f3e9f-b364-4022-97dc-49c7e0851506" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow"><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a>&nbsp;is the latest entry in a niche subgenre of survival games. As is tradition, players take on the role of someone new to the enigmatic "Zone" — the region surrounding the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant that exhibits strange, physics-defying "anomalies" and is filled to the brim with deadly mutants and even deadlier men.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-holding-a-bolt-given-to-you-by-richter.jpg?itok=FivDrhfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-holding-a-bolt-given-to-you-by-richter.jpg?itok=6nI2Bjs5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A simple bolt is enough to reveal (and in many cases, temporarily disable) the strange anomalies in the Zone.</figcaption></figure><h2>Stepping Into the Zone</h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;game gives its protagonist a burning motivation to explore the Zone. Our hero "Skif" has managed to sneak in after the Zone quite literally reached out and touched him, depositing a mysterious <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="791ae017-1b00-44d7-b743-dd1d4d274208" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/stalker-2-artifacts" rel="nofollow">artifact</a> in his apartment's laundry basket (and leaving a hole in the wall, to boot).</p>

<p>Skif's naivete and inexperience with the Zone make him a perfect audience surrogate. Neither he nor the player truly knows what to expect, and you're carefully guided through the potential hazards you'll encounter in the first hour of gameplay: strange anomalies, deadly mutants, and merciless bandits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several competing factions in the Zone, and your actions and choices could make a faction completely hostile to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prologue is very much on rails, but the time after it represents the heart of&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;well — you could opt to head straight to the nearby town of Zalissya, you could chase down some nearby side quests, or you could also disregard these options entirely and start exploring the Lesser Zone region of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6b0767a-b575-4657-971f-daae39968aae" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/stalker-2-map-and-locations" rel="nofollow">the map</a>&nbsp;on your own.</p>

<p>As someone who played some of the original&nbsp;<em>STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, I was initially impressed by&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2's</em>&nbsp;presentation. It&nbsp;seemed to be everything that a fan of the franchise would have wanted: a stable, relatively bug-free representation of the unique&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;experience in a modern engine. Sadly, that sense of wonder didn't last for long.</p>

<p>The first major issue I noticed with&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;was with its guns. Firing a few dozen rounds would absolutely tank the condition of your firearm. The durability damage to weapons and armor alike is simply far too harsh, especially with legendarily resilient weapons platforms such as the AK series of rifles.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, one of the final story missions features a running gun battle through a large underground facility. My high-quality, unique sniper rifle was in perfect condition at the outset, and it was practically falling apart at the halfway point of the mission. I had to pick up guns from dead enemies to have a fighting chance.</p>

<p>Adding insult to injury is the need to pay Technicians to maintain and repair your weapon for you. These repair costs were frankly absurd at launch (and have since been toned down in a post-launch patch), but the durability issue remains a seriously annoying problem.</p>

<p>There's no way to repair or maintain your weapons in the field, either, despite the fact that Skif shows off his ability to expertly reassemble an AKM-74S in under a minute during an early-game cutscene. Either the durability of guns needs to be substantially increased or there needs to be a mechanic to repair them a small amount in the field.</p>

<p>Gun issues aside, I fully embraced the spirit of a clever, cautious Stalker as I explored the Zone. I'd carefully check my corners and sweep rooms before moving forward, lest I be ambushed from behind. Unfortunately, the game was rigged from the start.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;franchise was once renowned for its "A-Life" system of interacting NPCs. You could be trodding along a relatively safe path and happen upon two groups of men in a gun battle or a group of mutants attacking a lone Stalker. That happens here, but the way these events and NPCs spawn is, frankly, atrocious.</p>

<p>Enemies would simply pop into existence within my line of sight. Sometimes, they would appear within a few meters of me! This didn't always happen, but the game does a poor job of hiding random enemy spawns much of the time.&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2's</em>&nbsp;handling of enemy spawns is downright clumsy.</p>

<p>This is especially frustrating in confined spaces. In one side mission, I went into a junkyard maze of crushed cars. I activated a side objective and was immediately set upon by two groups of bandits, even though I had checked all approaches and there was no one in sight. It shattered my suspension of disbelief then and there.</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;games,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;requires you to make choices that will affect the world around you and, ultimately, which ending you get. There are several competing factions in the Zone, and your actions and choices could make a faction completely hostile to you. None of this is communicated as clearly as it should be.</p>

<p>For example, some major choices are presented to the player with a unique interface showing a choice on either side. Each choice shows a particular symbol, but there is no easy way to know which faction these symbols represent or what the effects of your actions are on the world, nor is there any way to see your overall standing with a faction.</p>

<p>These same symbols are shown on the major bases (that is to say, towns) on the map. I intuited that the funky B symbol represented the Ward, but what faction is represented by the radiation symbol? How will my choices benefit them or harm them? I had no idea and no real way to find out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could imagine asking any character about a particular faction and they'd be able to tell me anything I wanted to know, but that's simply not an option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identifying these factions and what their motivations are is difficult, and this has consequences for you. I found myself completely cut off from several major bases simply because I opposed the Ward. In a game with limited fast travel, that made exploring certain regions of the map a downright ordeal.</p>

<p>There is no recorded in-game information for mutants, anomalies, or other zone phenomena, either. I only learned the names of Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists after I killed a truckload of them and happened upon their names through random NPC dialogue or mission objective text.</p>

<p><em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;needs&nbsp;a way to clearly find out this information and a section of the PDA to catalog what you've learned about the Zone. I could imagine asking any character about a particular faction and they'd be able to tell me anything I wanted to know, but that's simply not an option. This lack of information made it difficult to truly understand the world I was in.</p>

<p>I spent close to 200 hours thoroughly exploring&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;at a fairly relaxed pace. While it has its flaws, most of these are minor issues that are easily fixable; gun durability could be buffed a bit without too much work, and GSC Game World has already addressed the problem of outrageous repair costs and paltry payouts for mission rewards.</p>

<p>The more substantial issues such as a lack of information about factions or the janky enemy spawns can be fixed, too, although that will probably take a little more time. Thus far, the developers have shown a commitment to ironing out the rough edges and I believe that they'll make the overall experience much smoother in time.</p>

<p>Still, I can't help but love the Zone and its colorful cast of characters. There are no good guys or bad guys, there are just guys, and they all have their own motivations for the actions they take. It's up to you to hear them out and decide which choices will be best for you, the Zone, and all of the odd people (and mutants) who dwell within.</p>

<p>If you can get past these flaws,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;is a unique flavor of survival game that can be enjoyed by veterans of the franchise and new players alike. If you can't stand the occasional jankiness, though, it would be best to wait a few months and see if GSC Game World can iron out the more serious problems.</p>

That includes a new promotion with Build-A-Bear that lets you make cuddly, suited-up versions of Sonic, Shadow, and Tails. I can’t lie, I’m somewhat drawn to the idea of making Shadow and dressing him up in cool clothes. I’m not sure if the fashion for these little guys has gotten better since I last entered a Build-A-Bear maybe seven years ago, but Shadow is one of the few characters who might get me to try it out. [<em>What’s wrong with Gengar, you monster—Ed</em>]</p><p>The most interesting thing about the promotion, however, is that Build-A-Bear might have dropped a hint about <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s story by giving Shadow a specific accessory.

These are used to transform Sonic and Shadow into their super forms, which give them the ability to fly, make them more powerful, and turn their quills into a golden yellow or white.

<p>It has been announced that a Squid Game x Call of Duty Black Ops 6 collaboration will be coming in January.</p>



<p>The collaboration was announced on the official X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1863599034759295124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty account</a>, where the account said, “An invite you can’t ignore. Netflix Squid Game comes to Call of Duty this January.”</p>



<p>Squid Game Season 2 premieres on Netflix on December 26, 2024, and the third and final season will be available sometime in 2025. Netflix predicted that by October 2021, Squid Game generated approximately $900 million US in value for the company, with the series only costing $21.4 million to produce.</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s announcement that the collaboration will come in January suggests that it’s likely to drop in the mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1, which is often referred to as the “reloaded” update, which typically comes with new multiplayer maps and game modes. </p>



<p>It’s unclear what exactly the Squid Game and Call of Duty collaboration could entail, but it’s likely to involve new weapons and character skins. Alternatively, Call of Duty and Netflix could do something a little more special with the collaboration this time around, possibly a new party-type game mode.</p>



<p>What do you think the Squid Game and Call of Duty Black Ops 6 collaboration will look like? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Furthermore, IGN can exclusively reveal a first look at the Lara Croft miniature that will be included in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomb Raider: The Crypt of Chronos <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1708218446/tomb-raider-the-crypt-of-chronos?ref=discovery&amp;term=tomb%20raider&amp;total_hits=15&amp;category_id=34" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is set to start its Kickstarter in late May 2025,</a> and you can check out the first look at how Lara will look in the game below.

During the game, Lara is on a journey to the island of Kairos to search for an artifact said to "hold the reins of time." She will have to survive dangerous terrain, devious traps, and a familiar foe in Natla Technologies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the modes, the first one is called Adventure Book Mode and is meant to be a structured, story-driven experience that will guide players through various scenarios. There are various missions to undertake and they can last anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If players are looking for a longer adventure, Campaign Mode is the way to go as it will be a "vast, free-roaming experience on an expansive island map" that will take around three hours to complete. There will also be randomized locations and missions to keep things fresh for each new play session.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter which mode you play, there will be a crafting system that allows players to gather more powerful weapons, outfits, and abilities.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/02/kickstarter-preview-image-1-1733155795268.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Iconiq Studios has confirmed that, while Tomb Raider: The Crypt of Chronos has been built around solo play like the games, it will let players bring a long some friends for the ride. It is designed around one playable character, but multiple players can work together to solve the problems Lara faces and complete the game in the best way possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned, Tomb Raider: The Crypt of Chronos will launch its Kickstarter in late May 2025 but you can check out more details <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1708218446/tomb-raider-the-crypt-of-chronos?ref=discovery&amp;term=tomb%20raider&amp;total_hits=15&amp;category_id=34" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by visiting the page right now.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more in the world of Tomb Raider, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-review-netflix-hayley-atwell">our review of Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft,</a> the news that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-line-to-play-lara-croft-in-prime-videos-tomb-raider-series">Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner is in talks to play Lara in the upcoming Prime Video series,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/three-tomb-raider-games-from-an-awkward-time-in-lara-crofts-history-are-getting-remastered">the latest details on Tomb Raider IV - VI Remastered</a> ahead of its launch on February 14, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

Those who own them through GOG can still expect "a seamless experience and tech support" that will preserve "their experiences for years to come," however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG is also offering fans who don't yet own Warcraft 1 and 2 a discount code for the games, with users who enter "MakeWarcraftLiveForever" able to get a $2 or equivalent price reduction on the bundle containing both (otherwise priced at $14.99).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The removal comes exactly one month after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remasters-shadow-dropped-with-improved-graphics-quality-of-life-improvements-and-other-new-features">Blizzard released remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2</a>, which are available on Battle.net for $9.99 and $14.99 respectively. The original versions of both games are also still available to purchase for $5.99 and $9.99 respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-owned-gog-begins-preservation-program-to-ensure-the-longevity-of-fallout-the-witcher-and-more">The GOG Preservation Program was also announced in November</a> as a means to ensure the longevity of over 100 games such as Fallout: New Vegas, The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings, Resident Evil, and more. Warcraft 1 and 2 feature on this list too, and GOG has used their delisting as an opportunity to make clear it will continue to support Preservation Program games even if they're removed from sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store," it said. "This means that owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles. This also considers potential changes in Windows OS that may impact games' playability."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Preservation is a growing concern for video game fans worldwide who worry about games new and old losing functionality as time goes on. A chief example comes in The Crew, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-sued-after-shutting-down-the-crew">which Ubisoft removed from sale and took offline in March</a>. This means The Crew, which was released in 2014, can no longer be played in any capacity, now or in the future. It no longer exists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crew was an online-only game and therefore part of a category perhaps more at risk of delisting, but even single-player games are increasingly becoming at risk. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-your-copy-of-star-wars-jedi-survivor-might-need-a-big-day-one-download">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, for example, is a purely single-player game that launched only partly on-disc</a>. It otherwise required a download for the complete game, and therefore its physical version cannot exist without an internet connection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG said it wants hundreds of games to enter the GOG Preservation Program by the end of 2025, and that it currently has a long backlog of games currently being evaluated. Each game must pass through many quality tests before it is deemed of a high enough standard to enter the GOG Preservation Program. Games which fail will be improved upon until they match GOG's standards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">However, a Black Ops 6 player named "Aldredd" created a Twitter/X account under the name "<a href="https://x.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863315265523499422" rel="nofollow ">Beamishh</a>" to share the achievement and screenshots of the final rewards. The player does reply to one of their posts to <a href="https://x.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863377291515936833" rel="nofollow ">confirm that Zombies exploits were used</a> to level up, allowing them to grind out levels faster than other players.</p><p dir="ltr">It's uncertain which specific exploits were used, but it was seemingly related to AFK glitches to allow the player to leave their Xbox on and still farm XP. Treyarch has worked to patch Zombies exploits for various map areas and unintended ways to earn XP faster, but new exploits are often still discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">For the rewards, the level-1,000 milestone includes an operator skin for Eric Samuels, who is a character from the Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 campaign. Additional rewards include an emblem, spray, gobblegum pack, loading screen, and a PP-919 weapon blueprint.</p><p dir="ltr">These final rewards don't look fancy, which some players might find disappointing, but other players might be excited that the rewards could be teasing the future of Call of Duty. Black Ops 2 missions tackled storylines in both 1980 and 2025, and Eric Samuels was part of the Secret Service detail protecting the president during the drone attack on Los Angeles in 2025. Samuel's Black Ops 6 skin features futuristic armor, and the weapon blueprint's in-game description says, "Get a glimpse of the day after tomorrow with the Enigma Tech weapon blueprint."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't revealed any details about next year's Call of Duty game, but, reportedly, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-will-be-black-ops-2-sequel-report/1100-6520054/">looks to be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/">future design plans for Call of Duty</a> also seemingly leaked, which discusses a new committee that could decide on what features and innovations get implemented into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, Activision has revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/">Squid Game collaboration is coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a> in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-preview-promising-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4194f220-0158-4c21-86bf-7d9322d3390d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towers-of-aghasba-hands-off-preview-revitalize-island-with-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow"><strong>hands-off preview event</strong></a> showcasing&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba,&nbsp;</em>I've been excited to get my hands on a copy and see how the ecosystems and biomes work. The art looked amazing, the creature designs varied, and being able to heal animals and the land is something I love IRL. Getting to try out new mechanics related to restoring the environment, as well as the fresh take it gives crafting games, really drew my interest. After multiple ecosystems, two save games, and more, this is my take on the title.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b2ff7c2f-3a27-4fa4-89cd-ea40cb660f04" href="https://techraptor.net/games/towers-of-aghasba" rel="nofollow"><strong><i>Towers of Aghasba</i></strong></a>&nbsp;is a new crafting-building game under the survival genre. To call it a simple survival game, however, is to diminish the unique mechanics that set it apart from other titles. A focus on restoring the natural world, balancing human expansion, and defeating the Withered corruption combine to create a visually compelling and saturated world that is ever-changing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-huldra-forest-god.jpg?itok=B3n1F3Gl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-huldra-forest-god.jpg?itok=55EDxTbM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are multiple ways you can play&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba,&nbsp;</em>each resulting in a different world. Depending on where you put your Colossal Seed, the types of animals attracted will change. Different biomes sprout different plants, and each time you grow the tree, you'll see new plants and animals appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're not tasked with just revitalizing the ecosystems of Aghasba, but the civilization of the Shimu, as well. Collecting resources, building up different villages, and restoring relics of the past are linked to the colossal trees. There's a price for human expansion, however.</p>

<p>Amity, the essence of life found in living things, is used to fuel the environments around the Colossal trees, activate portals, and more. Picking plants, chopping trees, and killing animals all deplete your Amity. Rarer resources take larger amounts of Amity. You'll even take damage if you pick something with no Amity to give.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-king-flower-temperate-colossal-tree-growing.jpg?itok=ZjS9jrhv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-king-flower-temperate-colossal-tree-growing.jpg?itok=d3aU2spM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The give and take of Amity is a mechanic that enforces respecting nature and only taking what you need. Without Amity you won't be able to upgrade ecosystems, unlock any fast travel, or restore Sacred Forests. These are all needed to keep your villages and capital city going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there's the Withered, the main enemies in <em>Towers of Aghasba</em>. A pestilence on the land, Withered areas sap your health. Withered nests are surrounded by various enemies, all looking to take your life. There's some variation to the enemies, but most of the ones you'll encounter are humanoid, giant hands, or spiders. There's an arachnophobia setting for those who fear the creepy crawlies. With that said, there's not a lot of variety in Withered enemies as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first chapter of the Shimu in&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is fully fleshed out in the Early Access release. There's humor in the narrative, as well as a serious tone concerning the extinction of the Jubanga and nature. Most of the story revolves around learning the history of the Shimu and their flight from Aghasba.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-underwater.jpg?itok=rXKzppck 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-underwater.jpg?itok=6k03p6SM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This all takes place in a visually rich and diverse land. All backgrounds are hand-painted with inspiration drawn from Studio Ghibli films, such as&nbsp;<em>Naussica of the Valley of Wind.&nbsp;</em>When a shrine is restored or a tree upgraded, the transformation art is amazing. The unfurling of vines, sprouting of grass, and blossoming of flowers is a sight to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it all sounds fantastic,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is an early access title that comes with its own share of problems. Some bugs are to be expected, but you can clip through rocks while swimming, lag can cause enemies to jump locations, game crashes, and inconsistent atmospheric music. Some things have been greatly improved in the few patches that have gone live since the game's release, but there are still various glitches that need to be worked out.</p>

<p>This has caused multiple changes in recipes and items. Some recipes haven't appeared where they're supposed to. Stations are having their plans changed, if they show up at all. Animals and plants aren't loading properly, even though a fix was deployed. The first month may be filled with multiple small updates to improve the quality of the game and address issues players experience.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-rebuilt-shrine.jpg?itok=zuu4NfeV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-rebuilt-shrine.jpg?itok=gA-L3cfR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Along with the bugs, there's the actual premise of the game. Having different creatures spawn depending on ecosystem proximity, and other location factors, is a complex mechanic. This also impacts resources in the area and what becomes available to the player. Balancing the inputs, outputs, how these resources affect multiplayer interactions, and game requirements all take fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, the dev team at Dreamlit is on top of it all, ensuring bugs are dealt with quickly, while focusing on continuing to create more compelling content. The roadmap for future updates is impressive, and will include access to the region the fourth god is in. It's expected access to the Sea Temple to the southwest of mainland Aghasba will also come soon.&nbsp;</p>

Swamp and Mountain are in the works, with a Mountain biome most likely going to the north of Moyo Vale and containing snow. While these ecosystems appear to be coming towards the end of 2025, a new area is set to come in an update in early 2025. With the roadmap going into 2026 it can be surmised that the Early Access phase will last over a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know I'm excited to see new enemies, new animals, how creature relationships can improve, and potentially expand the game further. For those that are interested in a new take on city building, and crafting, with some survival mixed in,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is the game to try. I'll be keeping an eye for future development and new content to see where Early Access takes the game.&nbsp;</p>

Concluding with <em>Bloodborne</em> and its fans’ relentless calls for more <em>Bloodborne</em> was certainly a choice. </p><p>Some have called using a 30th-anniversary celebration to target <em>Bloodborne</em> sickos “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pure evil</a></span>.” “Someone at PlayStation woke up and chose violence today,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another. But what does it mean?

Will the notorious 30fps action game finally get a 60fps mode on PS5? Could fans be in for a full-blown remaster with a PS5 Pro enhanced mode like <em>Demon’s Souls</em> received? Or maybe this is just a knowing wink at a community with a penchant for grandiose speculation and perennial disappointment. </p><p>There have been more rumors than usual flying around following a particularly intriguing coincidence. The December 3 anniversary, an easter egg for which seemed to be teasing more announcements <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-state-play-30th-anniversary-sony-playstati-1851696796&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-state-play-30th-anniversary-sony-playstati-1851696796">in a recent PS5 slim trailer</a></span>, also happens to be when <em>Bloodborne</em> servers go <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1m2pi/bloodborne_servers_are_undergoing_maintenance_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1m2pi/bloodborne_servers_are_undergoing_maintenance_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">down for scheduled maintenance</a></span>, which was first announced several weeks ago. Probably nothing, right? Right?</p><p>It’s never been exactly clear what the hold-up is, given the <em>Dark Souls </em>spiritual spin-off’s critical acclaim and sales success (7.5 million copies sold by last count). FromSoftware made it, but Sony owns the rights. Maybe neither party can agree on what it would take to bring the game into the future nearly a decade later. Bluepoint Games, which made the <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Soul</em> remakes, felt like an obvious candidate to work on an update but is reportedly in pre-production for its own original IP. </p><p>Whatever the case may be, <em>Bloodborne</em> fans will never give up. Sony’s acknowledgment of that fact means we’ve just entered a brand new phase of “<em>Bloodborne</em> remake when” chants routinely breaking out on social media and PlayStation showcase livestream chats. Oh, look at that: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-nominees-goty-tga-black-myth-keighley-1851701923&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-nominees-goty-tga-black-myth-keighley-1851701923">Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards 2024</a></span> are only a week away. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover-announced-for-january.1049778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision Blizzard has announced a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover for January, and if that one was on your bingo card, then I'm going to need you to tell me where you get your bingo cards from.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the crossover yet; it's presumably set to coincide with the start of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s Season 2, so we likely won't learn more until we're just a couple of weeks away from that season's commencement.</p>

<p>However, we do know that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>will collide in some way. Presumably,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>will worm its way into both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em>, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=qpX5rIBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=fqCLmqDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>are about to collide.</figcaption></figure><p>In the very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, a soldier walks into a room and sees two other soldiers on the floor, presumably dead.</p>

<p>Between the soldiers' bodies, he sees a small piece of paper, which he picks up. On that paper are three symbols: a circle, a triangle, and a square. They're not PlayStation symbols, though; they're the distinctive&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>shapes that appear on workers' masks in the show.</p>

<p>We then cut to a rather clever variation on the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>logo that includes the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>symbols. It's really not much to go on, but hey, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>fan, you can have some fun theorizing what the crossover might entail before it lands.</p>




<p>This is, of course, far from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s first weird crossover. The franchise has previously entertained the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shredder-from-tmnt-stalks-into-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-warzone-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>' Shredder</a>, noted gamer fuels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-teams-up-with-mt-dew-and-doritos-for-charity-and-loot" rel="nofollow">Mountain Dew and Doritos</a>, and other strange collaborations as guests.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>news, the franchise's latest game&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the biggest launch</a> the series has ever seen, helping to catapult&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole over the 500 million sales mark.</p>

<p>That's despite a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option" rel="nofollow">rather dubious audio pack</a> announced prior to the game's launch, one that seemingly enhances in-game audio like gunshots and footsteps for players willing to fork out a little extra cash.</p>

            <p>
Every now and then, somebody has the marvellous idea of developing technology that <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/gamescent-ai-device-smell-video-games-price-release-date">makes video games smell</a>. I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.
</p>
<p>
"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

Urge is currently in early access, having launched in 2021 with that most respectable of final release dates - When It's Done, You Grasping Ingrates, And Not One Second Before. It starts with you pulling yourself out of a car crash and investigating a world suffused with a mysterious fog. Not the nice kind of mysterious fog, mind you. Not fog like in Silent Hill, where it symbolises repressed trauma while elegantly covering up the limitations of the game engine. Nothing so wholesome. This fog is, basically, wee smoke. And the world of Urge consists largely of wee. 
</p><p>
Some of it erupts from the ground in stinking geysers. Some of it fills the wobbly heads of the mutants who shamble up to murder you - victims of a strange addiction whose origins may lie in the map's larger industrial areas, or in the tunnels and sewers beneath.</p>
<p>In a fanciful reinterpretation of piss thermodynamics that is seemingly justified by the lore, some of the wee exists as powder - dusting the tops of storage cases, released in gusts by latrine-shaped gourds, or forming horrible ammoniac stalactites indoors. And some of it is contained by your character, and must be regularly excreted in the course of attending to other survival game needs like hunger, thirst and shelter.
</p>
<p>
Whether liquid or powder, piss must be disposed of correctly, because if it's disposed of incorrectly - for example, by widdling on the ground rather than into a proper toilet - it'll add to the world's fog. The more fog there is, the more enemies there are, and the worse those enemies become. Think giant yellow spiders, chainsaw dudes in soiled hazmats, and tall, hollow-eyed creatures who look to me like urine cakes pounded flat. Also, piss meteors. Piss lightning too. 
</p>
<p>
Mitigating the spread of wee-wee is difficult, and not just because you will occasionally need to spend a penny yourself (you can also drink the stuff if you don't have any other potable fluids to hand, like poison or blood). In the world of Urge, piss can be transformed into fuel for things like abandoned vehicles, which emit gauzy yellow clouds of piss vapour when in motion. As such, play appears to involve regular alternations in fog intensity, with you building and crafting to minimise the spillage of urine while periodically, as it were, pissing it all up because you need to drive to another town.
</p><p>
I'm... compelled by all this partly for the extremely online leftwing reason that it feels like a metaphor for climate change. But looking at it from more of a design standpoint, I also like the sound of a survival game that encourages you to survive with delicacy and discretion, lest you bring about a golden apocalypse. Perhaps there's an RPS diary series in it? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304350/Urge/">You can read more on Steam</a>. As Ollie noted in the meeting earlier, the Steam page amuses partly for the great care taken not to use the word "piss" too often, presumably to avoid rousing the distaste of Steam's curation algorithms.

Is it because the game is a few days away from launching on December 6? Could it be because it’s a game my friends and I might actually play together after almost all of them stopped playing <em>Overwatch 2</em>? Or is it just because my relationship with <em>Overwatch </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">has grown so cold</a></span> that I’m willing to seek comfort in the warm embrace of another hero shooter? Yes to all of the above, but it’s not what’s fueling my newfound hype; it’s the anime OP-ass launch trailer NetEase put out over the weekend.</p><p>The trailer doubles as both a launch trailer and a reveal of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">final five heroes</a></span> joining <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ launch roster. Iron Fist, Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger (think Ice Climbers from <em>Smash Bros. </em>with two characters being one playable entity), Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine will all join the line-up of 33 heroes pushing legally distinct payloads. That’s all well and good, and I’ll probably give comic-accurate short king Wolverine a try, but what I’m most excited by today is how NetEase and vocalist Chrissy Costanza created the kind of hero showcase music video you only see in front of an anime that makes you believe in the power of friendship. Costanza’s vocals on “Rivals ‘Til the End” soar over action-packed scenes of Marvel’s greatest heroes doing hero shit. All the cool team-ups—like Hulk throwing Wolverine and Magik teleporting Psylocke up the side of an exploding skyscraper—are sick, but every cool moment is elevated by how good the song is. It’s peak anime opening, and I hope it plays when you boot up the game, because you will not catch me skipping it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luckily, all this excitement isn’t unfounded.

This update added five new themes for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-games-for-the-playstation-5-1845726626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-games-for-the-playstation-5-1845726626">PlayStation 5</a></span> dashboard, four of which are based on past consoles and one based on the PlayStation brand itself. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1863620268687573453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1863620268687573453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The themes are really cool</a></span>. I picked the PS2 theme, and not only did it add all the abstract blue and green objects from the PS2 boot menu to my PS5's dashboard, it also changed all the colors in all the menus and added PS2 menu noises to everything. I didn’t realize until swapping between the different themes how burnt into my brain some of these old PlayStation noises are and how much nostalgia I had for them all these years (decades?!) later. </p><p>However, the big star of this update, in my opinion, and why you should boot up your PS5 as soon as possible is the newly added OG PlayStation 1 boot-up video and sounds. When I restarted my PS5 console after confirming the update and installing it, I was greeted with the techno-operatic and very loud chime of the classic PlayStation boot-up logos, complete with the echo fade out of metal clinking. </p><p>Here’s what the logo looks and sounds like via a phone recording from me: </p><p>I half expected <em>Twisted Metal </em>or <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> to start playing after all the noises had subsided. Later, when I turned off the console to write this post, the PS5 had even updated that screen to add a little message thanking me for playing over the last 30 years. </p><p>Weirdly, while this stuff is rad and awesome, Sony says that it’s just temporary and eventually it will go away. I’m not sure why Sony would remove this stuff from PS5 as it’s a nice way to acknowledge the past and let people enjoy their expensive consoles a bit more. But what do I know? Anyway, if you want to get on this PlayStation nostalgia, don’t wait too long to boot up your PS5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/virtus-pro-eliminated-shanghai-major-amouranth-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Virtus.pro was just forcefully ejected from the Shanghai Major by Wildcard, the esports organisation co-owned by Amouranth. In a crushing defeat, Virtus.pro failed to gain traction against the underdog side that is also facing elimination. </p>



<p>It was a particularly sour loss for Virtus.pro, given that the team is made up of champion-grade players but failed to secure a meaningful win during the opening stage of the Shanghai Major.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-poor-show">Poor Show</h2>



<p>Virtus.pro will be heading home with just $10,000 in winnings, which won’t go a long way towards covering the costs of getting to Shanghai in the first place. It was a struggle from start to finish for Virtus.pro, with the team managing to secure just one win – and that was against Rare Atom, a bottom-table Chinese side with short legs in the game.</p>



<p>Rare Atom’s biggest claim to fame in this event is that the team sent Fnatic packing. The European organisation lost against Wildcard, Cloud9, and finally Rare Item, failing to secure a single point before being ejected from the tournament.</p>



<p>Virus.pro is the latest team to leave the competition in Shanghai, and the team is facing some ridicule on social media because the ultimate loss came at the hands of Wildcard, a team co-owned by Amouranth, the scandalous, controversial content creator. In June, Amouranth secured a significant ownership stake in the North American organisation.</p>



<p>The remaining matches in the opening stage of the Shanghai Major will wrap tomorrow, and then from December 5, the elimination stage will unravel. This round features some of the biggest names in CS2 esports, and it will end with just eight teams making it into the playoff stage, fighting for the $500,000 grand prize.</p>

Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>.

"Their connection has remained a mystery, and this provides the perfect adventure for our game," Gustafsson said.</p><p>According to MachineGames, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-almost-enough-cut-scenes-for-two-movies/1100-6528083/" data-ref-id="1100-6528083">the game will have nearly four hours of cutscenes</a>, which equates to nearly Indiana Jones movies in length.</p><h2 id="Setting">Setting</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248281-indy-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248281-indy-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248281"></a><figcaption>A closer look at Sukhotai temple.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248281-indy-6.jpg"></figure><p>Get ready for some digital tourism, as The Great Circle will take Indy from his familiar stomping grounds of Marshall College in Connecticut to the ancient halls of the Vatican, the arid deserts of Egypt, the sunken temples of Sukhothai, and the icy peaks of the Himalayas. These locations will see Indy face off against human enemies and dodge ancient traps as he solves puzzles, leading to some blockbuster moments of action when all hell breaks loose.</p><p>"We wanted to explore where Indy would be at this time, having just separated from Marion, being sort of lost again, adrift in his own obsessions with his work," Gustafsson added.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-devs-accessed-special-archive-to-create-authentic-adventure/1100-6526571/" data-ref-id="1100-6526571">Indy fans can also expect an authentic adventure</a>, as MachineGames worked closely with Lucasfilm Games, drawing from an archive of unseen Indiana Jones material to help craft this globe-trotting romp.</p><h2 id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20x3FPB_G5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/20x3FPB_G5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to design director Jens Andersson, The Great Circle will mostly be a first-person game with a few moments of third-person gameplay. "Our game is about putting you in the shoes of an iconic hero," Andersson said. "Since we are doing this mostly in first-person, you have the chance to truly become Indy. First-person makes you part of this world--allowing you to explore and experience things more intimately."</p><p>In typical Indiana Jones fashion, you'll also be punching, shooting, and whipping your way through enemies, but if you'd prefer a stealthier approach, you can avoid combat and stick to the shadows. If you've played MachineGames' Wolfenstein games, this will sound pretty familiar, as those titles also juggled the ability to play as a covert operative making a destructive entrance. And in case you're worried about harming dogs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-a-humane-solution-for-battling-dogs/1100-6527484/" data-ref-id="1100-6527484">the game has a very humane way of dealing with them</a>.</p><p>Locations also feature optional puzzles to solve, and when things do go pear-shaped, Indy can use his environment, quick thinking, and whip to his advantage. During the third-person sections of the game, the camera will zoom out and give players a better view of Indy as he navigates traps and uses his whip to overcome them.</p><p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feels like an amalgam of many genres but appears to be striking the right balance between them, all in favor of honoring the spirit of Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor <em>and </em>adventurer," Kurt Indovina <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">wrote in a hands-on preview of the game</a>.</p><h2 id="Graphics_and_performance">Graphics and performance</h2><p>On Xbox Series X|S, MachineGames is aiming to have the game run at 60fps. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-60fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-series-s/1100-6527479/" data-ref-id="1100-6527479">Game director Axel Torvenius said</a> the game should "feel cohesive" and that means "running smoothly at 60[fps] on both [Xbox Series X and S]."</p><h2 id="Is_Lucasfilm_involved_in_the_development_of_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_">Is Lucasfilm involved in the development of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</h2><p>One reassuring fact about the development of the new Indiana Jones game is that MachineGames has worked closely with Lucasfilm Games to create an authentic entry in the franchise. You can see the results of this in Indy's design and the world around him, as the game looks like it was ripped straight from the original trilogy of films. Lifelong Indiana Jones fan and Bethesda creative director Todd Howard is also involved, as he'll periodically check in on the game's development in his role as an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-clarifies-his-involvement-in-new-indiana-jones-game/1100-6497886/">executive producer</a>.</p><h2 id="Is_Harrison_Ford_in_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_">Is Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248279-indy-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248279-indy-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248279"></a><figcaption>We recognize that face!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248279-indy-1.jpg"></figure><p>Kind of! While Ford's grizzled mug has been digitally transferred to his in-game character model--signature facial scar and all--he won't be voiced by the legendary actor. Instead, Troy Baker will be breathing life into this incarnation of Jones, as Ford had previously committed to never playing the role again after he finished work on Dial of Destiny. Horror movie icon Tony Todd will also be in the game, lending his voice to a "mysterious giant of a man" who steals a seemingly insignificant artifact from Indy's college.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-art-of-balance-in-community-management<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction:"><span>Introduction:</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In community management, keeping in touch with fans is key. A community manager acts as a bridge between devs and players, responds to community feedback, and keeps expectations in check. Communicating with fans is something I know well, because before I was the Community Manager for The Battle of Polytopia, I was a fan of the game myself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I first discovered The Battle of Polytopia as a fan of Civilisation, another strategy-based game. This was when I stumbled on the Midjiwan Discord group, which had under 100 players in it at the time. I became the moderator of the group, and then the manager, before being given the opportunity to transform it into the official Discord group. In 2019, I became the official Community Manager. From</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> then </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to now, the group has grown from 2,000 to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>46,000!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having experienced both sides of the community, one of my key take-aways has been that a crucial part of fostering strong community growth is striking a balance between fan input and preserving the team’s creative vision.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Organically listening to community feedback">Organically listening to community feedback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players have the right to be listened to, and community discussion provides novel ways of injecting community ideas into a game. Though player feedback does not have to be implemented, getting players involved is important.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few years ago, Polytopia’s Discord group allowed players to vote for the moderator of their respective tribe’s Discord channel. Players used a RNG system to randomly appoint the moderator leader of the Bardur tribe. This inspired the development team to choose the leader of the in-game Bardur tribe with the roll of a dice. This goes to show that, as a result of getting the players involved, they can organically and positively impact the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord is a key method of updating players and allows you to instantly access suggestions from thousands of fans, but with great fan engagement comes great responsibility. This volume of engagement comes with the duty to manage conversations and moderate. It's also important to expand the community beyond one platform, keeping on top of social media posts and emails; in addition to Discord, we use Reddit, Instagram, and X. Having a variety of platforms also means they can intersect and bring different groups of fans together. For example, we sometimes post fanart from the Polytopia subreddit on X while discussing news about the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An important part of community management is knowing when to put a stop to things, as this helps to maintain the balance between the fans and the team. When Midjiwan called on the community to design an in-game language for the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ tribe, several challenges arose due to the volume of input and concerns about the moderation of content. In this situation, the best course of action was to politely put an end to the activity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lesson here? Community input is a natural process, and not always call-and-response. We encourage players to interact and bond with other players, while keeping on top of&nbsp; moderation and dialogues on Discord.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players and community growth">Players and community growth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve explored the tools, but different players have different needs, and recognising this leads to community growth. Midjiwan’s community consists of three main subgroups; the first are meditative, meaning they play as a pastime and dislike changes to the core game; the second discuss the lore and want to learn more about it; the third are competitive players who are focused on game balancing. Recognising the differences between each section of the community fosters growth in the wider playerbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another way to promote discussions and growth is to consciously build the lore. In Polytopia’s case, players gradually learn the lore as they play and through various community events we run. Creating competitions or community initiatives, like having fans create community art, is also very effective.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, it is crucial that you respect the time of volunteers. Part of this is distinguishing between the role of a freelance artist and a fan. This approach helps to keep the creative vision intact, while including the fans and building the community.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, the core of community management is keeping the balance. It’s a joy to have a passionate audience engaging with your work, and to take pride in the world you have created. At the same time, it’s important to keep the creative vision intact, and manage your community as fans, not creators.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
