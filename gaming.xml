			<p>Like many other companies, Taiwanese computer, electronics, and phone manufacturer ASUS posted its quarterly reports, and Chief Financial Officer Nick Wu spoke about the new ROG Ally products, released last month in partnership with Xbox. During the Q3 2025 investor call, Wu claimed the market response has been highly positive, and demand for these pricier devices has surprised even ASUS. </p>



<p><em>As many of you know, we introduced the first-generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer. Over the past couple of years, this new category, especially within the Windows ecosystem and creating this particular new category, has proven itself to be highly successful. We believe that we have achieved our original goals in terms of premium positioning and creating a new growth driver in the gaming segment. That is why we launched the 3rd-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see that the market response for it has been extremely positive. Particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models exceeding our expectations. In fact, these high-end variants are currently in short supply.</em> <em>We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that currently exists. Our goal for the ROG Ally is to remain a core pillar within the ASUS gaming portfolio, while also driving tangible revenue and profit growth for the company.</em></p>



<p>The CFO went on to say that the company estimates a revenue contribution from these launches to be between 3 and 5 billion New Taiwan dollars (NT$), which translates to between $96 million and $160 million. The robust demand leads ASUS to believe that this could increase slightly in future quarters to a range of between 4 and 5 billion NT$ (128-160 million US dollars).</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, David Carcasole praised its advanced hardware capabilities but also criticized the price tag, wondering if there was even an audience for it. Apparently, so far, it's more than enough as far as ASUS is concerned.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the recently released game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> teased the second chapter.</p>
<p>Now, in an update via Falcom's <a href="https://www.falcom.co.jp/ir-data/20251112-1">latest financial report for September 2025</a>, the company has reportedly locked in a release window for the remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC – with the game scheduled to arrive by the fiscal year ending <strong>September 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/if-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-doesnt-get-a-sequel-our-fans-will-go-youve-got-to-be-kidding-me-nihon-falcom-ceo-on-future-releases/">recent interview</a>, the Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo mentioned how a remake of the second entry had to happen. Once again, here's what he had to say (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">via Push Square</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hiqkvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If we didn’t follow up with a remake of Trails in the Sky SC, people would go, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ So, we do want to do a remake along the lines of Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/highly-anticipated-rpg-remake-trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-confirmed-for-2026-release">colleagues at Push Square also note</a>, "the second Trails in the Sky game is widely considered to be one of the franchise's best instalments. It's got a gut-punching story and some fantastic character development — alongside some of the most memorable boss encounters in the series".</p>
<p>And without getting too far ahead, Kondo has previously stated how anything beyond this (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">as in a remake of the third instalment</a>) will likely come down to "fan demand". For now, no specific platforms have been confirmed for the second chapter just yet, so when there's an official announcement, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>The 1st Chapter was released on the Switch and Switch 2 on 19th September 2025, and since then, the Switch 2 version has received some "image quality and performance settings". There's also a demo you can download from the eShop.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review.1353415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the campaign mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review"><u><em>multiplayer review in progress</em></u></a><em>, and our Zombies mode review is still on its way.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bucking the usual trend of breaks between numbered sequels, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is following just 12 months on from Black Ops 6, and you’d perhaps assume that meant only small tweaks to what was one of the series’ high points last year. But the teams at Raven and Treyarch evidently don’t see it that way, and have instead built one of the most unconventional CoD campaigns to date. In many ways, it doesn’t even feel like a CoD single-player mode. It’s more like a multiplayer experiment squeezed into a campaign shell, playing best when you’re accompanied by squadmates, echoing Zombies or the now-defunct DMZ at times. I recently criticised Battlefield 6’s single-player for playing it safe and not taking any risks, and to Black Ops 7’s credit, the same can’t be said here. The problem, however, is that not many of its big swings hit, resulting in one of Call of Duty’s most intriguing, yet flawed campaigns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its varied string of missions walks the tightrope between traditional military shooter and schlocky sci-fi nonsense, darting between worlds beyond our technological fingertips and deep within our most haunted of dreams. That spectacle is supported by sharp gunplay and a whole host of gadgetry and abilities that make moving around those worlds incredibly satisfying. But it all culminates in a brand-new endgame portion that stitches together aspects of CoD’s past open-world successes and failures in an attempt to become something new. In reality, that post-credits content is a repetitive shooting gallery that adds little to the excitement that leads up to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of Black Ops 7’s intrigue emanates from one fundamental design choice: for the first time in many years, a Call of Duty campaign is fully playable in four-player co-op, and it really does feel like it has been made with that in mind as the preferred method of play. This comes with both positives and negatives. Teaming up with friends is good fun, with fighting big bosses that have multiple weak points to fire upon simultaneously or stealthily working through an enemy area tactically, both coming with a good deal of satisfaction. But it also detrimentally affects the solo experience, from not having AI companions fill in for you if no buddies are online, or kicking you for inactivity if you’re idle for too long, to not even being able to pause due to its online-only nature. Its open areas and endgame portion seem catered toward a group experience as well, and can end up just a little lonely when zipping around by yourself. To an extent, it feels like Activision is finally admitting that most people come to its hallmark shooter for multiplayer fun, rather than the single-player story modes the series was founded on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, having played several missions in both co-op and single-player, I can confirm that playing solo is borderline tedious due to having to repeat multiple objectives, such as placing C4 on a building yourself four times rather than splitting them up as is intended. There are also no difficulty options this time around, meaning that, in theory, it should scale the threat depending on how many players are in your squad. In my experience, though, the number of enemies in a level remains the same, leaving me feeling overwhelmed by foes even in its earliest levels. By comparison, playing in a full squad makes these encounters a breeze, with not enough targets to go around sometimes. In fact, enemy numbers are uneven across the campaign as a whole, sometimes swarming you with dozens of rabid rushers, but at others, presenting you with a couple of soldiers wandering through a door when you’re expecting an onslaught. It’s, admittedly, a difficult balance to get right, but one that has not been achieved here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It really does seem like it was made to be played in four-player co-op.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the structure of the campaign, Black Ops 7’s story is delivered at breakneck speed, taking me just about five hours to reach the endgame. Its 11 missions threw me from one exotic location to the next, from one time period to another, and deep into nightmare realms full of otherworldly horrors and delights. The year is 2035, and new threats are here to instigate a global collapse once again. The re-emergence of Black Ops 2 villain Raul Menendez thrusts the playable unit, Spectre One, into action and soon has them facing off against evil tech company The Guild. What follows is a set of missions that throws you in and out of reality thanks to a fear toxin being weaponised by The Guild, led by Kiernan Shipka’s Emma Kagan, who is trading in Mad Men for mad mechs here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A combination of cliched evil sci-fi tech corp and Batman Arkham scarecrow-esque antics leads each level to interesting places from a visual perspective, as long-buried memories of our protagonists are dredged up and morphed into horror-filled mazes. It makes for a more varied campaign when it comes to art design, with an impressive number of locations and creatures thematically filling them to gun down. I do wish there was a little more in terms of mission variety when it comes to actual level and objective design, though, with corridor shooting taking the lead in most of these excursions. There’s nothing to rival the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-coolest-mission-shows-its-time-call-of-duty-left-modern-warfare-behind"><u>creeping intrigue of last year’s Emergence</u></a> conceptually and its branching objectives and playful enemy design, for example, nor the spy-like cool of infiltrating an embassy fundraiser or high-roller casino.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If last year’s Black Ops 6 leaned more into grounded espionage and subterfuge, 7 is a much louder proposition, choosing to demolish the lobby of a complex to gain access to it rather than sweet-talking the security guard standing in front of it. As a result, there is no shortage of big moments justifying its blockbuster label. Dodging giant falling machetes like you’ve stumbled into a Looney Tunes cartoon is a one-off joy, as is taking control of a lavish luxury boat and ramming into the side of a building. Moments like this feel pinched right out of Christopher Nolan’s back pocket and sit perfectly in the Call of Duty mold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s just the opening section of one of the standout missions, which takes place in Tokyo and has you dipping into its subway systems and leaping across rooftops. There’s a great sense of forward momentum to levels like these, and I’m a massive fan of them. I just wish more of the campaign were like this Japanese chapter, as I’m not so keen on the ones taking place in the more open-zone areas of the fictional French city-state of Avalon (itself a huge battle royale-sized hub), which struggle to bottle the same exciting energy. These typically have you moving across wider rural patches of its map in order to chase the next cluster of enemies to take down, and essentially serve as tutorials for its endgame. They’re a little less authored than others and fail to capture the same thrills as a result.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Much of the time, it doesn’t really feel like a ‘Call of Duty’ campaign at all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, much of the time, it doesn’t really feel like a ‘Call of Duty’ campaign at all. Yes, it has the militaristic hallmarks, but borrows just as much from horde shooters like Left 4 Dead and its own in-house zombie modes. It makes for an uneven set of missions, some of which really don’t work for me, but with others that do manage to hit the spot when they capture some of the CoD cinematic legacy. They’re a rarity, though, and for every one of these, there is also a bizarrely dull sequence, such as the time you’re asked to play Frogger on a twisted, upside-down LA highway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, the gunplay is snappy and satisfying, with SMGs delightfully ripping through armoured enemies and sniper rifles really coming into their own and popping out bits of brain in some of the campaign’s open areas. Each weapon has a good weight to it and is super-responsive when pulling the trigger. It’s Call of Duty, they’ve been doing this for a long time now, and how good its guns feel shouldn’t come as a shock as you rip through enemy healthbars and armor chunks. These extra layers to their vitality do present a slightly more drawn-out cadence to gunfights, though, with a few extra bursts of the trigger needed to take down each. The firearms are supported by a fantastic selection of skills and gadgets, too, with killstreaks making their way into single-player, such as the joyously destructive war machine, allowing for quick mob clean-ups.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Weapons in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll admit, I was initially sceptical of the near-future setting and Call of Duty’s return to tinkering with near-future tech when it comes to movement, but on the whole, the experiment is largely a success. Wall jumping can be a little clunky, but the kinetic super jump is very fun to use as a quick flanking tool, as is my favourite of the bunch, the grapple hook. Swinging up to roofs to find a better vantage point before swooping down on a wingsuit to get back up close opens up each level’s architecture in interesting ways. It may never reach that Titanfall 2 gold standard when it comes to FPS mobility, but there are flashes of it here, which is always welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This desire to experiment also carries into its approach to boss design, which is by no means revolutionary when it comes to FPS campaigns, but a relatively new thing for Call of Duty. I appreciate the efforts made in order to make each have its own gimmick, even if they all ultimately come down to draining an oversized health bar while dodging projectiles. They certainly aren’t complex, but hitting the glowing weak points of a giant, bile-spewing plant in a cave of nightmares is certainly a step up from just pumping bullets into a Juggernaut for the hundredth time, especially when multiple targets are offered up at once and really make the whole co-op nature of the campaign feel worthwhile.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Movement may never reach that Titanfall 2 gold standard, but there are flashes of it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, enemy variety is quite impressive this time around, with human, mechanical, and hallucinatory foes offering different threats that challenge you at all distances. Guild forces include a robot army, as well as traditional militia types such as the machine-gun-wielding Raider, colossal armor-plated Titan, and other NFL team-name adjacent units. Yes, most can be handled with some well-aimed assault rifle fire to the head, but there are more effective ways to deal with them if you choose to explore your arsenal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I particularly enjoyed one incursion into a robotics lab, which equipped me with a Black Hat hacking device. I liked how it switched up the cadence of the unrelenting bullets a little, and meant I could disrupt and destroy these Terminator wannabes from cover. It even made a miniboss of this zone — an admittedly unexciting rotating turret — easier to take down. I appreciate that, in a game of such ferocious speed as this, you’re occasionally rewarded for taking a breath and using your brain to overcome objectives rather than solely relying on pure firepower.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of a shame, then, that once the campaign’s set of linear missions is over, the endgame borrows little of this philosophy. After the main story’s credits have rolled, you’re offered a chance to experience its epilogue, which takes place in the open region of Avalon that’s teased throughout. If you played Call of Duty’s DMZ mode, then you’ll have a rough idea of what to expect here: it’s an extraction shooter, except it's not. You and up to three friends can team up and drop into this battle royale-sized map and complete the activities that litter it with eye-soreing regularity. On every street corner are Guild checkpoints or zombie-infested buildings to clear out as you progress through its difficulty-tiered regions in order to reach its final boss, located at the epicentre of the island’s toxic smog. The catch? If your squad goes down, you lose all of your progress. That progress is mainly tied to your combat rating, a number that goes up the more killing and map icon clearing you do, and it's therefore up to you to know when to call it quits on a certain run and extract from the map within a time limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For each level you go up, you’ll get a skill point to plug into any of two given options. These can range from armor plates automatically regenerating when you get kills to overall movement speed or rate of fire increases. The idea is to keep building up your character until you’ve reached the minimum recommended level of 55 and shut down the toxic threat sweeping across Avalon. The progression feels genuine, too, with my character resembling a super soldier at higher ranks, thanks to the sheer amount of speed I harnessed and the damage I could absorb. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The bones of an exciting endgame are here, but it gets tired a little too soon.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, I like this idea and think there are the bones of an exciting mode here — something that could capture the magic the likes of Helldivers 2 has done in recent times — but as is, it unfortunately gets a little tired a little too soon. Objectives are almost all exclusively “go to this place and clear out the enemies there,” which I understand is part of the fundamentals when it comes to shooters, but I would’ve appreciated a little more variety and something that mirrored the minor puzzle-solving sections of the main campaign, or at least clever uses of the gadgetry it introduces. The enemy AI that walks Avalon’s streets is also dumb as bricks and pops out of cover freely, making each encounter a simple affair when you put enough distance between you and them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, zooming around on grapple hooks and transitioning into wing suit gliding mid-fall is still incredibly satisfying, as is plotting out methods of attack in a four-player squad, but all semblance of interesting level or mission design is traded in upon entry here for a few hours of relatively mindless shooting in order to watch some numbers tick up. In some ways, it sits somewhere between the campaign missions and Zombies in its design, but frustratingly borrows the least interesting aspects of both, neglecting the mission structure and mystery-solving that each mode thrives on. It results in a reasonably enjoyable, but not essential, second serving to the campaign. And don’t worry, if the endgame doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, or even sounds a little daunting (the ferocity of its bullet sponge hordes can get overwhelming in its latter stages, especially when heading in solo), the story does wrap up satisfyingly enough beforehand for it not to feel like you’re missing out on an ending completely.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Simon Cardy Ranks Every COD Campaign He's Played</h3><p>A ranking of all of the Call of Duty campaigns that I've played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a story nowhere near as accomplished as last year’s effort, though. Effectively a direct sequel to Black Ops 2 that also ties into the events of Black Ops 6, presumed knowledge and the speed at which its setup is told can be a little disorientating, especially if you aren’t familiar with its 2012 predecessor. The themes are personal this time around, with David “Section” Mason, recast here as Heroes’ Milo Ventimiglia, placed centre stage as he battles with his past – namely the loss of his father, Alex. There are some fun revelations along the way, as well as treats for long-term fans of the Black Ops series, but as someone who has never held those characters in as high regard as their Modern Warfare counterparts, the pulling of the heartstrings didn’t quite work for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means that the rest of the Spectre One squad doesn’t really get plot points of their own aside from flashes of resurfacing trauma, relegating them very much to support characters in David’s world, as Michael Rooker’s Harper in particular is given some truly dumb lines to scream as loud as he can. That being said, if you are someone who has always preferred the adventures of Woods, Mason, Adler, and co, I’m sure you’ll have a great time here. It does mean, though, that this revisiting of the past, combined with a thick layer of exposition, can make the early hours of the story relatively impenetrable to newcomers, so I’d bear that in mind if you’re coming in fresh. I’d really recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-timeline"><u>a thorough recap of the Black Ops timeline</u></a> to all if you wish to get the most out of it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign is a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition. Not every roll of the dice pays off, but there’s enough enjoyment to be found across its 11 missions to not feel like a dud, at least when played in its desired co-op fashion. Beyond that, its endgame has the seed of a good idea that could be nurtured with future efforts, but it comes across as a little repetitive and supplementary to the story Black Ops 7 is trying to tell. With satisfying gunplay and very fun movement abilities providing solid foundations, there’s a reasonable mix of styles on show here, even if it doesn’t fire on all cylinders 100% of the time. Despite being a step down from last year’s exhilarating Black Ops 6 campaign, it certainly takes some big swings – they just don’t always land. It’s not bad. It’s not good. It’s simply okay.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h5><p><span>November 14th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Treyarch, Raven Software</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite being the seventh title in the Black Ops franchise, this year's title, co-developed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/treyarch-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-presents-our-most-ambitious-campaign-yet/">Treyarch</a> and Raven Software, sidesteps last year's title and is instead billed as a direct follow-up to a title that launched back on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 centers around the return of the antagonist of that story, Raul Menendez, back once again and threatening to burn the whole world down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With Raul Menendez, the overarching antagonist of the second Black Ops title, seemingly back from the dead, a new security contractor/paramilitary force known as The Guild has risen up to protect the world against this terrorist. Even though Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is linked directly with the second title, players get a crash course on the events of a game that was released more than a dozen years ago, yet still futuristic in its timeline (the second Black Ops title was set in 2025, while Black Ops 7 takes place ten years later in 2035). Even if you have never played a Call of Duty title before and know nothing about the task force and various characters, the game's flashy set pieces and nonstop action will draw most players in.</p>



<p>While Menendez is the face of Black Ops 7's campaign early on, this spectre of a bygone era is little more than a boogeyman than an actual threat. No, it should come as no surprise that this up-and-coming security force known as The Guild is the real threat this time around. Led by a millennial woman who channels her inner Elizabeth Holmes in public, this faction is one of Call of Duty's least effective villains. Their main driving force is in the creation and testing of an experimental psychoactive drug that makes the victim hallucinate or lash out in rage. It's a somewhat low-tech solution for a paramilitary company that bills itself as a leader in robotics and AI.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an era of deepfakes, bringing Raul Menendez back from the dead to make a public threat does little to push the narrative forward beyond digging up painful memories for the lead character and his crew. At no point did Menendez feel like a credible threat during the campaign beyond the collective psychotrips that Mason and his crew endure on a regular basis. I daresay that beyond all of The Guild's scheming and desire to build and test a new chemical weapon, this is overall one of the lowest-stakes campaigns to come around to Call of Duty in a while. The Guild rarely feels as powerful and imposing as its figurehead Kagan would lead the public to believe, even with their technology and fancy toys, and the eleven chapters of the co-op campaign lead up to a rather weak confrontation on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Early on in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's co-op campaign, Mason and his crew are subjected to the psychoactive substance that The Guild has been cooking up, and due to the convenient plot device of having the team share a neural link, they can all go on a collective trip into the deep reaches of each protagonist's repressed trauma. For Mason, it's revisiting Nicaragua to chase down Menendez while massive machetes rain from the sky. For others, it's breaking out of a Russian prison or revisiting 2025 Los Angeles in the midst of a terrorist attack. These set pieces offer something dynamically different from the rest of the narrative, removing the grounded sci-fi military narrative with metaphysical threats and horrors twisted to that character's state of mind. With how the narrative keeps jumping between chasing down Kagan and The Guild in the real world and another psychoactive trip in the next chapter, it can be difficult to keep track of what's going on without the whiplash of jumping between one narrative and the next. Throw in a single mission set in Japan with a different military faction, and you've got one messy timeline to follow along (if nothing else, this mission helps to justify the return of fan favorite multiplayer maps like Raid and Express with a Japanese makeover). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following up from Black Ops 2 is a tough order for Treyarch and the numerous development studios that worked together to release Black Ops 7 just one year after the sixth numbered sequel. Black Ops 2 introduced significant innovation to the campaign's narrative and flow, most notably through branching storylines and Strike Force missions. Both of these are omitted from Black Ops 7's co-op campaign, instead focused on a rollercoaster that takes players from the televised return of Raul Menendez to the fall of The Guild and lingering around Avalon to clean up the remains in the separate Endgame mode. Instead, the real innovations to the campaign storytelling this time around come by way of the ability to play through the entire shooting gallery campaign with three other friends and a progression track that feeds into the overall leveling up and unlocks for the other two core multiplayer modes. A lack of proper drop-in-and-drop-out matchmaking missed the opportunity to jump into a game with friends during the review period, unless we coordinated to try and meet up before queueing for a specific mission.</p>



<p>From beginning to Endgame (counting a single successful extraction), players are looking at around six to seven hours for the co-op campaign and not much reason to play the first eleven missions unless you missed a collectible (thankfully just one per mission) or the occasional achievement in certain chapters for pulling off an exemplary task. The few campaign missions that take place in Avalon during the latter half of the campaign lacked the sense of urgency and direction that the rest of the chapters had, instead feeling more like a brief tease for the open world map for the final chapter. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Endgame is indeed something unique for the Call of Duty campaigns, but might not feel too distinctly different from some of the other multiplayer offerings beyond the core multiplayer and zombies in earlier entries, namely Black Ops 4's Blackout and the likes of DMZ and MWZ. Players group up in squads of up to four and venture out to level up their chosen operator by completing repeatable missions all across the map of Avalon. As players level up, they'll pick up three different skill tracks out of a possible six, with each level providing a random boon to either their core stats or a skill unique to one of those three tech trees. Not all of these skill trees are created equal, as I found myself gravitating towards the Gunner track for faster reloads and Bulldozer for its immunity to self-inflicted explosions at the highest tier (a launcher was almost always part of my core loadout for Endgame).</p>



<p>Avalon is home to a variety of activities scattered throughout the map, but there isn't a sense of randomness to events across the map. For the most part, the majority of events are available on the map for players to pick off in any order they choose. With Endgame being exclusively a PvE mode, there isn't the excitement of running across an enemy squad like there was back in the days of DMZ. Instead, encounters feel almost like busy work as you replay them for the dozenth time because your operator died in the last match and you're having to start back up from zero. In just a few hours' time, I had a pretty good rotation of events to work with and quickly get my level up to where I could venture into at least the second-tiered zone early on and pick up a higher rarity weapon. Even as rival squads can lay claim to an activity on the map, let enough time pass, and players can come back to do it all over again for more loot and power XP.</p>

</figure>



<p>Unlike MWZ, there aren't interesting pieces of loot like weapon blueprints or hidden quests to be discovered. Forget scavenging around foot lockers or duffel bags for unique drops. All of the gear that players will come across is either part of their loadout when they spawn into the match or acquired through quest rewards and supply drops. Because of how the weapon attachment system works for Endgame, it's often best to bring in a weapon that you've been leveling up in the core modes, complete with attachments and all, then use the various upgrade machines in each tier to boost the rarity of the weapon and its damage output. What attachments come on a field acquisition weapon is dictated by its initial rarity: base green tier (uncommon) weapons are limited to two, rare weapons three, epic four, and legendary weapons have five attachment slots. </p>



<p>There were also unique weapons that could be uncovered. Still, because I had barely scraped the surface of the highest difficulty tier in Endgame, I'm leaving that out of the campaign review. Instead, I will include it in our separate multiplayer review, which will be published soon. I've already had a sneak peek at what's to come in the first major content drop for Endgame, including some massive dinosaurs and bosses that are far more interesting than the basic Guild grunts and zombies littered around Avalon.</p>



<p>The strengths of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ready-for-launch-progression-prestige">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s campaign rally around three pillars new for this year's entry: playing with friends, shared progression, and integrating the open-world mode into the campaign. The first two are features that I hope remain a constant in Call of Duty moving forward, but it's tough to recommend Endgame as the main reason to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when previous modes like DMZ and Blackout offered a far more interesting set of challenges. These inclusions alone help bolster a campaign that otherwise felt like one of the lowest stakes a Call of Duty task force had ever had to shoot their way through. Whether you're here to see the continuation of Alex Mason's story from a decade ago or are just here for more of Michael Rooker's one-liners, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 shines through when you experience it with friends.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Being able to play through Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's campaign in a full squad of four and then jump straight into the Endgame makes this one of the more enjoyable Call of Duty campaigns in recent years, even if the story being told fails to live up to the hype.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Version 21.0.0 borked compatibility</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="dc2f3f1430d2e"><a title="Switch 2 Dock" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc2f3f1430d2e/switch-2-dock.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have already seen some reports claiming third-party docks are no longer compatible with the Switch 2. These stories started popping up after Nintendo rolled out a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major system update</a> earlier this week, which bumped its new hybrid device up to Version 21.0.0.</p>
<p>We've investigated this with a quick test of one of the devices we have on hand (specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/antank-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-a-decent-little-travel-dock">S3 MAX TV Dock Station by Antank</a>), and it appears to be functioning as normal. It seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1oufk3v/switch_2_3rd_party_dock_issues_after_recent/">we might not be alone here</a>, but it's now got us wondering how it's been going for <em>other</em> third-party dock users since Nintendo rolled out the latest updates.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186280 @ 1763106496 -->
<p>Some of the advice being shared online at the moment is to hold off updating your system if you've got a third-party dock. Certain manufacturers have also issued notices advising users to avoid the latest firmware update while they work on dock fixes, and a handful of companies have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1oufk3v/comment/nokyxir/">supposedly already overcome any issues</a>. This apparently includes new updates for Hagibis, Jemdo and Jsaux-branded docks.</p>
<p>We've previously acknowledged how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-usb-c-chip-might-be-breaking-compatibility-with-third-party-docks">there could be an "ongoing battle"</a> between Nintendo and third-party dock makers, and unless it's an officially licensed product, there's always going to be a chance Nintendo could take action. And we've even seen some fans now claiming their official Switch 2 dock is now experiencing problems after this latest firmware update.</p>
<p>So, how has your Switch 2 third-party dock experience been so far? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Join in on the fun this weekend</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d5cc7d4d9aed9"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d5cc7d4d9aed9/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, Nintendo kicked off its 'Global Test Ride' demo for the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>Now, ahead of the next test window, Nintendo has released a new patch, bumping the demo up to <strong>Version 1.0.1</strong>. It addresses multiple issues, so the pink puff and his fellow racers can hopefully look forward to improved conditions on the track this weekend.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Kirby Air Riders: Ver. 1.0.1 (Released 13th November, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Addressed the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved communication stability during online play.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where City Trial matching sometimes did not successfully connect after a long period of time.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where City Trial matches would sometimes not start properly.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where other players’ games might not progress, such as a player experiencing a communication error in a paddock.</li>
<li>Made several other miscellaneous gameplay fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may still experience matching and communication issues after this update. If a match does not start after 90 seconds or more on the matching screen, try exiting the matching screen. If you cannot exit, try restarting the software.</p>

<p>During an <a href="https://youtu.be/VZ33zDaH1-w">interview with Kyle Bosman recently</a>, Circana's video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella revealed the new entry in the series is "so far" the "best-selling" physical release in the US this year, while noting how Pokémon (in general) continues to be an unstoppable force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mat Piscatella:</strong> "Pokémon is the biggest media property around right now, it's leading in our toys tracking, the trading cards are one of the biggest drivers of the entire toy industry right now...it's broken all containment from the video game world in terms of the franchise strength.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59opxzgk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>"It's the best-selling physical game of the year so far already and it's only been in the market a few weeks. It's going to be one of the big drivers of the holiday quarter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not long after the new game's release on the Switch and Switch 2, The Pokémon Company revealed the anticipated title had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-sold-5-8-million-copies-globally-in-its-first-week">shifted more than 5.8 million copies worldwide</a> in its first week.</p>
<p>However, not all regions have necessarily reflected the same level of success, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">Z-A's retail sales in Europe</a> reportedly the smallest for the main Pokémon games since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee!</a>.</p>
<p>Although this latest Pokémon entry is available as a <em>proper</em> physical game on the Switch 2, earlier this week, it was revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> would launch on Nintendo's new hardware as a Game-Key Card release, which could potentially impact sales of the title.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-bose-smart-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-no-name-soundbar-prices-2000644172</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-offloads-bose-smart-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-no-name-soundbar-prices.1353337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For decades, TV speakers have disappointed viewers with thin and muddy audio failing to live up to the visual quality of modern displays. Soundbars solve that problem by fitting proper speakers and amplification into a sleek package that fits beneath your TV without taking up space and adding the complexity of full surround sound systems.</p>
<p>The Bose smart Dolby Atmos soundbar brings premium audio technology from one of the most respected names in sound, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/">and Amazon just dropped its price to an all-time low of $399 from the standard $499 tag</a>. It puts a Bose soundbar with top-notch features at the same price point as generic mid-range soundbars without the brand reputation or expert audio engineering that Bose brings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Sound Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos adds a third dimension of height channels</strong> to the traditional surround format, with the ability to place audio objects in space with pinpoint accuracy around and above you, rather than just from the left and right. It’s a spatial audio technology that makes movie soundtracks feel far more realistic, placing the sounds of helicopters passing overhead or rain falling from above in the correct places. To pull off this trick, the Bose soundbar features an acoustic architecture that somehow manages to shoehorn five separate transducers into its compact frame, including two upward-firing speakers that reflect sound off your ceiling to create the illusion of height channels.</p>
<p>TrueSpace technology denotes proprietary Bose processing that works beyond Dolby Atmos content. This intelligent system analyzes whatever audio signal you feed it, be it standard stereo music, older 5.1 surround soundtracks, or streaming content without spatial encoding. The <strong>processing upmixes those conventional formats to create a more enveloping and expansive sound</strong> <strong>experience</strong> from the soundbar’s multi-driver configuration.</p>



<p><em>A.I. Dialogue Mode</em> addresses one of the most common complaints about modern audio mixing: voices getting buried beneath music and effects. This artificial intelligence system continuously monitors the audio stream, and identifies dialogue frequencies and dynamically adjusting the balance to ensure voices remain clear and prominent without completely suppressing the atmospheric sounds that create immersion.</p>



<p>Voice control integration provides hands-free operation thanks to integrated Amazon Alexa functionality. Adjust the volume, change inputs, play music, or even fire up other smart home devices-all are possible with voice commands and no need to pick up a remote. Bose <em>Voice4Video</em> takes it a step further: it allows you to<strong> take control of your TV and either the cable or satellite box through the voice system</strong> of the soundbar, consolidating several devices into one unified voice control interface.</p>
<p>It features just about every major wireless streaming protocol, giving flexibility in the way you send audio to the system. Bluetooth connectivity works with any phone, tablet, or computer for easy wireless streaming. Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio for iPhone and Mac users while enabling multi-room audio with other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you control playback directly from within the Spotify app with improved stability and quality compared to standard Bluetooth. Chromecast built-in supports casting from thousands of compatible apps on Android devices and computers.</p>
<p>Physical connectivity includes HDMI eARC for easy TV connection and support for all audio formats; optical input is available for older TVs, and USB is for service updates. The HDMI eARC connection carries both standard audio and advanced formats like Dolby Atmos through a single cable while allowing the soundbar to respond to your TV remote’s volume controls.</p>

Of course, the main selling point of this bundle might be the steelbook case, which features a cool shot of RoboCop.

"If you're a fan of RoboCop, then you'll find a lot to love in Rogue City," wrote critic Richard Wakeling. "It's chock full of Easter eggs and manages to capture the look and feel of the first two RoboCop movies with excellent attention to detail, even getting Peter Weller to reprise his role as the eponymous hero. More than anything, it does a tremendous job of making you feel like RoboCop in its best moments."</p><p>While the new RoboCop: Rogue City Collection is a physical-only release, both Rogue City and Rogue City: Unfinished Business are also available as standalone titles on PS5, Xbox, and PC.

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RoboCop-Collectors-Ultra-Blu-ray-UHD/dp/B0CZ4GTJ3W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RoboCop 2: Collector's Edition</a> on 4K Blu-ray is available at Amazon for $24, and it's packed with bonus content like commentary from the crew and features like OCP Declassified, Adapting Frank Miller's RoboCop 2, and a look at the movie's special effects. There's also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6414HLP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RoboCop: Director's Cut</a> on 4K Blu-ray for $35, which is offered by Arrow Video and gets you a bunch of additional scenes that weren't included in the original theatrical release. A cheaper alternative is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RoboCop-Collectors-Ultra-Blu-ray-UHD/dp/B0CZ4H7TFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RoboCop: Collector's Edition</a> on 4K Blu-ray, which is just $22.49 (was $25). All three are available now, and should make the wait for the RoboCop: Rogue City Steelbook Collection on December 2 a bit easier.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><hr><p>tk</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-collector-bundle-amazon-deal/1100-6534680/">Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mac-mini-m4-opens-black-friday-season-now-selling-at-new-record-low-on-amazon.1353319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never discounts its products directly so third-party retailer deals are especially noteworthy for anyone looking to save on premium hardware. Amazon just kicked off Black Friday pricing for several Apple devices including AirTags, MacBook Air models, and the brand-new Mac Mini with M4 chip. The 2024 Mac Mini is Apple’s more affordable desktop computer, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">and the 256GB model is now available for $499 instead of its usual $599 price</a>. That’s a $100 discount and an all-time low for a machine that’s only been on the market for roughly a year now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop Power in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The<strong> M4 is among the latest generations of Apple silicon</strong> and brings impressive boosts in performance from what was a breathtakingly remarkable M2 that powered the last Mac Mini. The processor houses 10 CPU cores-again, a mix of performance and efficiency cores-allowing the system to handle tasks dynamically, depending on their computational demands.</p>
<p>The <strong>GPU here is an integrated 10-core GPU on the same chip as the CPU for all graphical processing</strong>. It does away with discrete graphics cards while still offering high-end visual performance. This unified architecture allows the GPU to share the same 16GB of unified memory as the CPU, meaning that in graphics-intensive applications, data access is way quicker than in systems where the GPU has separate video memory that constantly needs data transfers.</p>



<p>Speaking of memory, <strong>the 16GB of unified RAM is a significant upgrade from the base 8GB configuration Apple used</strong> in previous entry-level Macs. You can run many applications simultaneously without the slowdowns that occur when systems begin swapping data to storage. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open while working in productivity apps, editing photos, and listening to music without the frustrating lag that comes from too little RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>256GB SSD will provide fast storage for your operating system</strong>, applications, and files. Solid-state drives allow for near-instant boot times and app launches compared to traditional hard drives, while Apple’s custom controllers push read and write speeds even further than standard SSDs. This capacity works well if you primarily use cloud storage services or external drives for large media libraries, though heavy users who store extensive local file collections might want to consider external storage solutions or the higher-capacity models.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet is built into the Mac Mini</strong> for wired network connectivity, thus offering more stable and faster internet in many situations than Wi-Fi. It proves very helpful when transferring huge files across your local network, streaming high-bitrate video content, or keeping reliable connections during video calls and remote work. Inclusion of Ethernet at the base price level means you don’t need to purchase adapters or sacrifice USB ports for network connectivity; wired connections eliminate the interference issues that sometimes plague wireless networks.</p>
<p><em>Apple Intelligence</em> offers advanced machine learning on the desktop and automates a range of tasks from intelligent writing assistance and image generation to enhanced Siri capabilities. Because these features are local on the M4 chip and run without using the cloud, execution is faster and more private, since your data never has to leave the device.</p>
<p>Its compact design <strong>measures 5 inches square and 2 inches tall</strong>, and occupies only a minimum of desk space but delivering full desktop performance. That small footprint makes the Mac Mini perfect for tight workspaces, minimal desk sets, or whenever you need powerful computing in a configuration without the bulk of a tower.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>If you ask random gamers what price they think Valve will charge for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">newly announced Steam Machine hardware</a>, you’ll get <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kyleor.land/post/3m5hg7cmz422g">a wide range of guesses</a>. But if you ask the analysts who follow the game industry for a living the same question… well, you’ll actually get the same wide range of (somewhat better-informed) guesses.</p>
<p>At the high end of those guesses&nbsp;are analysts like <a href="https://www.fsquared.biz/about-fsquared/">F-Squared</a>‘s Michael Futter, who expects a starting price of $799 to $899 for the entry-level 512GB Steam Machine and a whopping $1,000 to $1,100 for the 2TB version. With <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">internal specs</a> that Futter says “will rival a PS5 and maybe even hit PS5 Pro performance,” we can expect a “hefty price tag” from Valve’s new console-like effort. At the same time, since Valve is “positioning this as a dedicated, powerful gaming PC… I suspect that the price will be below a similarly capable traditional desktop,” Futter said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dfcint.com/">DFC Intelligence</a> analyst David Cole similarly expects the Steam Machine to start at a price “around $800” and go up to “around $1,000” for the 2TB model. Cole said he expects Valve will seek “very low margins” or even break-even pricing on the hardware itself, which he said would probably lead to pricing “below a gaming PC but slightly above a high-end console.”</p>
<h2>A loss leader?</h2>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-market-analyst-superdata-research-has-been-shut-down-by-nielsen">Superdata Research</a> founder and <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">SuperJoost newsletter author</a> Joost Van Dreunen predicted the entry-level Steam Machine could come in as low as $549, rising to $749 for the 2TB version (plus an additional $50 for bundles including a Steam Controller).</p>
<p>To Van Dreunen, Valve’s unique position as a private company with a loyal fan base means it can “price its hardware to hit its own strategic sweet spot rather than mirror the competition.” And in this case, he said, that could mean taking a “modest” loss on the hardware as a way to get more gamers invested in SteamOS.</p>

<p>“Just like Sony and Microsoft, the real money isn’t in the box, it’s in the ecosystem you enter once you buy it,” Van Dreunen said. “To me the question isn’t whether Valve can afford to eat margin. It’s whether they want the SteamOS footprint to grow fast enough to justify it. … Strategically, this is about expanding the platform, not squeezing the hardware.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-switch-ps5-sequel-2000642061"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> was released back in 2018 on PS4 and Xbox One. <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369">It’s a very good open-world Wild West game</a> developed and published by Rockstar Games. And over six years later, this incredible video game, which got a PC port in 2019, has yet to receive a PS5/Series X update. Meanwhile, Rockstar recently confirmed that 2010’s <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> will, in fact, get a nice upgrade. Life is cruel like that sometimes.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-remaster-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-2000644016">On November 13, Rockstar Games announced that<em> Red Dead Redemption</em></a> would be ported to phones, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2. If you already own the PS4, Switch, or backwards-compatible digital Xbox 360 version of the game, you’ll get the upgrade for free when <em>RDR</em> makes the leap to new consoles <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">on December 2.</a> This new version of<em> Red Dead Redemption</em> supports 4K/60, enhanced image quality, and HDR support on PS5/Xbox. Meanwhile, on Nintendo Switch 2, RDR supports DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and 60FPS gameplay. And, like with 2023’s rerelease on PS4, this new version will include the zombie-infested <em>Undead Nightmare&nbsp;</em>DLC.&nbsp; Awesome stuff! But uh…hey, Rockstar, I think you forgot something.</p>

   <p>Since the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2020, Rockstar fans have been begging the company to update or upgrade<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> so that the game can take full advantage of the more powerful machines. Over on PC, <em>RDR 2</em> looks amazing with its high framerates, increased draw distances, and impressive resolutions. That’s not to say <em>RDR 2</em> on PS4 is an ugly game, but it could be so much better. And yet, six years later…nothing. No update. No upgrade. Just rumors and whispers that maybe one day it might happen. But it never does.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-leak-rdr-2-next-gen-red-dead-rockstar-1850852925">Even Xbox thought a modern update was coming</a>, according to leaked court documents from 2023. But alas, nope. Rockstar has seen fit to update and upgrade <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> from PS3 to PS4 to PS5. And it’s now planning to upgrade <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> from last gen to current gen, for free, too. Sadly, <em>RDR 2</em>, for whatever reason, isn’t getting the same treatment, at least not yet.</p> <p>I’ll admit, I laughed when I saw the news that <em>Red Dead Redempti</em>on would get a fancy PS5 upgrade before <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em> It’s funny, in a depressing kind of way. Which, for a game as sad as<em> RDR 2</em>, feels like poetry. But I’m not here for amusing parallels between art and real life. I’m here to blast away bandits and lawmen in <em>RDR 2</em> in 4K/60 on PS5 Pro. I guess I’ll just buy a <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Steam Machine next year and play <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> at 60FPS over there.</a> It’s probably the closest to a current-gen port we’ll get anytime soon, as <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> takes away most of Rockstar’s focus and resources.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-guns-for-every-possible-situation-in-arc-raiders.1353289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is the kind of game for which establishing strict metas is going to prove difficult. Your objective is to get out alive and with good loot; abstaining from violence is as valid a “strategy” as indulging in it. Is your death-machine build “better” than my stealthy saboteur who can easily outrun you and hide, getting away with all the stuff I collected, thereby “winning”? <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay has more going on, more varied “win conditions” than just who can kill who faster in a straight shootout.</p> <p>But some weapons do have genuine advantages over others. A strict showdown would reveal whose weapon and build options gave them the clear advantage. But we’re hardly running in perpetual circles shooting at each other all the time in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, nor are we all expected to kill one another until the last person declared standing is the winner. So one’s arsenal can serve many purposes, with a lot of room for stylistic preferences.</p>

 <p>The variety of weapons available in <i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you plan and build several different shooter archetypes, so let’s get into how these guns work.</p> <h2>What kinds of guns are in this game?</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> breaks its weapons down into eight broad categories: Assault Rifles, Battle Rifles, Submachine Guns, Shotguns, Pistols, Light Machineguns, Sniper Rifles, and “Special.”</p>

 <p>The guns in these categories also vary in terms of which of the five ammo types they use (Light, Medium, Heavy, Energy, and Launcher), as well as their firing mode, damage, firing rate, and range.</p> <p>Firing modes in particular are important as they determine the pace at which you can fire. Semi-auto fires with every pull of the trigger, full-auto constantly fires, and the three-round burst is rather self explanatory. Various other guns feature “actions,” meaning your character will have to operate the gun in some way after each shot (this is often distinct from reloading), so your shots will be slow, but usually quite powerful. Perhaps the most common example across a variety of different games is the bolt-action firing mode, which sees your character operating a bolt after each shot (simulating the operation of real-life bolt-action rifles).</p>

 <p>Why is all of this important? Well, if you want to run and gun, something like a Ferro, which is a heavy break-action rifle and requires you to load each round, won’t be as suitable as something like a Stitcher, which is a fully automatic submachine gun. But that Stitcher won’t help you nail a high-powered shot from a great distance; that’s the Ferro’s speciality.</p>

 <p>For each of these broad gun types, there are different rarities too, with rarer items being more powerful: gray is for common guns, green for uncommon, blue for rare, purple for epic, yellow for legendary.</p> <p>And with the exception of legendary guns, all guns can be leveled up three times to a max of level four. Various elements of a firearm improve as you level them up. Some will see increased magazine size and increased durability, others will see increased durability and fire-rate, and so on. I’m finding <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Weapons">this <i>Arc Raiders</i> wiki</a> to be an excellent resource for the raw numbers.</p>

 <p>So let’s sort these guns into some use cases, of which you’ll find there’s some overlap.</p> <h2>The best guns for close-quarters combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Shotguns on average promise wild amounts of high damage with exceedingly poor range. Great for times when you’re nervous someone might jump out from a corner mere feet away from you. For those, you get two options:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Il Toro:</b> Uncommon shotgun, pump-action (pretty awesome when leveled up and kitted out well)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Vulcano: </b>Epic shotgun, semi-automatic (the one time I had a chance to use this, I gut jumped and barely fired a shot off before it was long gone)</li> </ul> <p>Following that, submachine guns will fare well given their high firing rate comes at the cost of range, but you also don’t need to worry about having pinpoint accuracy.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Stitcher: </b>Common submachine gun, fully automatic (pretty awesome when fully leveled up and kitted out with good mods)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Bobcat: </b>Epic submachine gun, fully automatic</li> </ul> <p>Finally, assault rifles aren’t terrible in some cases, provided they’re fully automatic (for my playstyle, anyway—if you can accurately place semi-automatic shots while experiencing the panic of a close-quarters gun fight, more power to you). Fully automatic assault rifles include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Rattler: </b>Common assault rifle (frustrating to use at low levels, in my opinion)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Tempest:</b> Epic assault rifle</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Bettina:</b> Epic assault rifle</li> </ul> <h2>The best guns for medium-range combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644148"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644148">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>These are the situations in which your enemy isn’t so far off you need a scope to see ‘em, but they’re still far enough away to render something like a shotgun pretty pointless. <b>If you can control the recoil well and shoot in controlled bursts, the Rattler, Tempest, and Bettina are good options here too</b>. Otherwise, the following semi-automatic weapons and the lone three-round burst rifle will serve you well:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Kettle:</b> Common assault rifle, semi-automatic (I do not get along with this weapon, FWIW)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Arpeggio:</b> Common assault rifle, three-round burst (it’s like the FAMAS from <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> and the battle rifle from <i>Halo 2</i> had a baby)</li> </ul> <h2>The best guns for long-range combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644149">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the assault rifles above can certainly prove useful in some limited long-range situations, you have far better options for delivering high-damage, precision shots from a distance if your marksmanship is up to snuff.</p> <ul> <li><b>Ferro:</b> Common battle rifle, break-action (using this is the best part of losing all the way to subsisting on Common guns)</li> <li><b>Renegade:</b> Rare battle rifle, lever-action (like a faster though slightly weaker Ferro)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Osprey: </b>Rare sniper rifle, bolt-action (for when you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/dAXsSFlu6Ug">be her</a>)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Jupiter:</b> Legendary sniper rifle, bolt-action</li> </ul> <p>Note that the only gun with a scope at all in this game is the Osprey sniper rifle. Even the legendary Jupiter sniper rifle just has the screen zoom in a bit when ADS-ing instead of shifting to a scoped view.</p> <h2>What about those pistols?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644150" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644150"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644150">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Pistols and handguns are funny things in many shooters. On one hand, they are perhaps most functional as sidearms–perfect for those “oh, shit” moments when you don’t have enough time to reload your main weapon, and so fall back to something a little speedier though less powerful. On the other, they’re often too cool to just be guns you fall back on.</p>

 <p>If you’re after the theater of being <i>that</i> person with the quick trigger finger on a pistol, start with the Burletta for training wheels and graduate to the Venator.</p> <p>These are your four pistol options:&nbsp;<b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hairpin:</b> Common, slide-action (permanently silenced)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Burletta: </b>Uncommon, semi-automatic (definitely the most side-armed of sidearms)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Anvil: </b>Uncommon, single-action (<i>Arc Raiders</i>’ hand cannon)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Venator</b>: Rare, semi-automatic</li> </ul> <h2>And the toys</h2> <p>Everything above will cover your bases. But if you want to pack a ton of heat to take down the game’s biggest threats or show other players you’re not messing around, here are your options:&nbsp;<b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Torrente: </b>Rare light machine gun, fully automatic (the bullets literally go <i>brrrrrrr</i>)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Equalizer:</b> Legendary beam rifle, fully automatic</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hullcracker:</b> Epic armaments launcher, pump-action</li> </ul> <hr> <p>And there ya have it, roughly five different broad shooter archetypes spread out amongst <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ existing arsenal. Naturally, the higher tier of rarity, the better the gun is at the thing it does. Though you still might find, for example, that while the Ferro and Renegade occupy very similar territory, they have some clear differences that might still make the Ferro more appealing for some (namely the higher damage per shot).</p> <p>Also, all of these guns at level four are the best versions of themselves. As for modifications, muzzle attachments, rear stock options, and so forth, those are a subject for another day since they can help guide any one of these guns down a more specialized path.</p>

<p>The reveal of the nominations for The Game Awards 2025 is coming next week, according to new social media. With the show coming out on December 11th, 2025, we won’t have to wait long to know the winners.</p>







<p>Started in 2014 after separating from SpikeTV, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> have grown in size and scope since then. Celebrating the best of the year, the show, hosted by Geoff Keighley, is home to several big reveals and moments, which can overshadow things a bit. Even still, with a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. Plus, with Prime Video users now able to watch it, even more can tune in for the big ceremony. Well, we now know what games will be up for the big awards, including the highly-anticipated Game of the Year category, in less than a week. </p>



<h2 id="h-nominations-for-the-game-awards-2025-on-november-17th-2025">Nominations for The Game Awards 2025 on November 17th, 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1989073068938211349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, the official Game Awards account finally revealed that <strong>nominations for the awards show</strong> will go live on <strong>Monday, November 17th, 2025</strong>. A livestream announcing all of the titles will happen on <strong>Monday at 9 am PT/12 pm EST</strong>. To find out when it’s live in your time zone, <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/99b6fbcf">click here</a>. In years past, the videos have ranged from 8-10 minutes and go over every category, lastly having Game of the Year. You’ll be able to watch it go down on YouTube, Twitch, and other social media. We at Insider Gaming will also post the full nominations once available, so stay tuned for that!</p>



<p>As mentioned before, 2025 has been host to several amazing games. From independent games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/french-president-applauds-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Blue Prince to AAA titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-final-launch-trailer-playstation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> and Donkey Kong Bananza, the competition is fierce. While The Game Awards isn’t the ultimate say-so for what’s the best game of the year, past winners have been called as such. 2024’s Astro Bot and 2022’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a> are still highly regarded. Though, with 2025, it won’t be as clear-cut as other ceremonies.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-almost-30-developers-second-layoff-this-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-almost-30-developers-to-%E2%80%9Coptimize%E2%80%9D-development-of-its-tomb-raider-game.1353268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Crystal Dynamics announced that it has laid off "<em>just under 30</em>" developers, as part of the company's current restructuring. These cuts are the second layoff the company has had this year. The news was announced with a post on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/">company's LinkedIn page</a>, and called the decision "<em>difficult, but necessary</em>." It also claimed that this decision was made as a way to optimize the development of the next major Tomb Raider game it is currently making.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we've made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics' studios and teams. As a result, we've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation</em>," the studio wrote in its statement.</p>



<p>"<em>Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future.</em>"</p>



<p>It always feels like a contradiction that a studio would lay off staff to 'optimize' a studio's development, because having fewer people to work on the game means that the remaining staff have to do more with less. It sounds like it creates more bottlenecks than optimizations.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear more about the coming Tomb Raider game soon, though currently it seems like the next major Tomb Raider project we'll hear about will be the upcoming film, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">which stars Game of Throne's Sophie Turner in the titular role</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-reorganization-tomb-raider-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crystal-dynamics-hit-with-more-layoffs-due-to-%E2%80%98reorganization%E2%80%99.1353226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the third time in 2025, Crystal Dynamics has laid off more of its staff. As for why, it states that it’s due to reorganizing that is ‘necessary’.</p>







<p>Since 1992, Crystal Dynamics has delivered a solid lineup of games that many hold dear. From the epic Legacy of Kain series to the iconic Tomb Raider franchise, the company has a great legacy behind it. In recent years, however, it hasn’t lived up to that degree. Its last big release, 2020’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-avengers-final-update-makes-nearly-all-cosmetics-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Avengers</a>, was a commercial and critical flop. Unfortunately, the one project hoping to change that, Xbox’s reboot of Perfect Dark, was cancelled earlier this year. Now, after two already devastating layoffs, another one has come, this time firing 30 workers.</p>



<h2 id="h-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-staff-for-a-third-time-this-year">Crystal Dynamics Lays Off Staff for a Third Time This Year</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a LinkedIn post by the company, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a statement</a> regarding new layoffs. This time, it is letting go of around 30 staff members, though from which departments is unknown. As mentioned before, this is the third round of layoffs the company has had. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">happened in March</a> with 17 employees, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-layoffs/">the second in August</a> after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark’s cancellation</a> with an undisclosed amount. </p>



<p>“<strong>Today we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics’ studios and teams</strong>,” the team stated on LinkedIn. “<strong>As a result, we’ve parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation</strong>. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.”</p>



<p>As with last time, Crystal Dynamics assures fans that Tomb Raider is still in development. In fact, it stated that <strong>“…as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we’ve made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future.</strong>“</p>



<p>Layoffs are sadly not uncommon in the gaming industry, but the past few years have been terrible. Whole studios like Monolith Productions and games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rares-everwild-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a> shuttered instantly. Hopefully, the people affected will land on their feet and wish the best to them on their journey.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Crystal Dynamics layoffs? Is it disappointing to see? Still excited for the next Tomb Raider? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The biggest gaming announcement this week came from Valve when it revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">six-inch Steam Machine</a>, a new device coming in 2026 that will allow people to play PC games on their TV. Some have seen this as Valve attempting to enter the living room marketplace currently dominated by the mainstay platform-holders like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. But Valve apparently doesn't pay too much attention to existing consoles and instead came up with the idea for the Steam Machine by looking at the latest trends in PC gaming.</p><p>Software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that when Valve was setting out to create the Steam Machine, the company was "not looking at consoles or other products in that direction. Everything we do is informed by what's happening on the PC gaming side of things."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At the same time, he admitted that there ended up being "quite a bit of overlap" because the Steam Machine aims to make PC gaming "work better in the living room and that's traditionally where consoles have been."</p><p>"But really I would say that most of our thinking is not informed by what's happening on the console side, and so I don't know if we have many theories as to where that might be headed," Griffais said. "But in general it seems like people seem to be recognizing that there's quite a bit of value in a more PC-like experience and the customizability and all that, and so we're happy to see more of these elements being embraced by platforms in general."</p><p>Rumors have suggested that Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console could take the form of a more PC-like system. In any event, Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said the company considers the Steam Machine to be a PC and not a traditional gaming console.</p><p>"The Steam Machine is just one option in the ecosystem of gaming PCs out there. If you're already happy with your PC gaming experience, that's great. We love that," he said. "We are a PC gaming company. We're just trying to give you more options. And that's how we view it. It's just something that we think is a really great addition to a living room or a desktop, but it's just one other option that people can have available to them to play their Steam games basically."</p><p>The Steam Machine, along with Valve's new Steam Frame VR device and the next Steam controller, will launch in 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">Steam Machine pricing</a> has not been disclosed as of yet for any of the new devices, however. On the subject of pricing for the Steam Machine, Valve said it wants the system to be "affordable," but that doesn't tell us much. One analyst, Rhys Elliott, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">the "sweet spot" would be $400.</a></p><p>The Steam Machine runs the Linux-based SteamOS, similar to the Steam Deck, making the Steam Machine similar to the Steam Deck in a console form factor.</p>
