Along with the seafaring pirates, other sea creatures also support them, and now, a vengeful spirit from the deep has also emerged. In this article, we'll have a look at the new The Deep Themed Warband starter set for <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>. We'll have a look at what's in the box, and where to go from there.</p>
<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 12 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities, but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Jung Pirates are a faction for Bushido, and The Deep is a theme card.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>A drowning woman's heart torn asunder by her greedy husband’s apathy and avarice. Her unending rage becomes a terrible curse as she sinks slowly into the cold, dark embrace of the deep. But the raw power of time and tide will not let her die; they have work for her and those who once embodied a similar unrequited anger. A red pearl, the focus of her wrath, becomes a death sentence to whoever possesses it. What the seas have wrought, no one can tear asunder. There is no escaping them, those of the deep or the red pearl. Betray the pirate queen at your peril!</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Deep is a brand new themed box release for <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>. They fall under the Jung Pirates faction, but by taking the Deep theme card, it gives you access to the Red Pearl event (that becomes an attachment on an enemy model) for free. It also offers all friendly faction models Ranged Defence (+1) and each phase, allows you to give a friendly Deep model Terror, which makes it harder for an opponent to pass a fear test against them.</p>

<p>The Deep is a powerful theme card to play, but not because of pure aggressive combat ability, but because of the Mother-of-Pearl fighter. The Deep theme card is the only way you can use Mother-of-Pearl, which means you're getting the Red Pearl event for free.&nbsp; The Red Pearl attaches itself to an opposing unit of your choosing at the start of the game, and 5 of the units included in The Deep box have Vengeance [Red Pearl] which adds to the Death Sentance status that the Red Pearl gives to the enemy unit, on top of stripping Fear and giving any unit that charges the attached fighter, the Banzai trait.</p>
<p>The above would make you think that this is an aggressive warband, going after the unit with the Red Pearl attached, but it's not as simple as that. While the Red Pearl does help you take out a key enemy unit or powerful hitter, what The Deep likes to do is immobilize and hold enemy fighters, then grind them down every end phase with Mother-of-Pearl's unique effect that deals 2 damage to all enemies with Imoblised or Held markers. Keeping Mother-of-Peal safe then becomes the key, but luckily you get some cheap disposable crabs to do that.</p>
<p>A lot of The Deep fighters are quite pricey, so you will be trying to pull all that off with limited fighters. The Deep is a combo heavy theme, but fun and rewarding to play.</p>

Credit (GCT Studios)</figcaption></figure><h2>Where Should I Start With The Deep?</h2>
<p>The best place to start with The Deep is with the themed box. It contains 8 miniatures. It also has 2 theme cards and 9 special cards, 7 of which are restricted to The Deep theme.</p>
<p>The units included in The Deep themed box are:</p>
<ul><li>Mother-of-Pearl - The main character of the box, which a lot revolves around as mentioned above. Mother-of-Pearl's Drown ability deals 2 damage a turn to enemies that are Held or Imoblised. They also have access&nbsp;to an Imbolise ability using their&nbsp;Paralyse ki feat. They're not great in combat, but they can sacrifice a nearby Miyakomo's Echo, which can be replaced if nearby non-soulless enemies are taken out using the Tokkiko's Choice ki feat.</li>
<li>Jung Keikoku - Keikoku is expensive (1 rice more than Mother-of-Pearl) but is a solid fighter for getting in and holding enemies. Intangible makes it easy to get to the fighter you want to hold, and Indomitable (8) and Tough (1) make them difficult to gang up on and take out, allowing them to keep hold of the enemy fighter for longer.</li>
<li>Meunagi - Meunagi is a solid damage dealer for the Deep. Their attack has Pierce and Sharp, allowing them to get through Tough and Armour, and Bleed to build up damage that combines well with Mother-of-Pearl's Drown ability to keep damage racking up on enemies.</li>
<li>Anko - Anko is a combo piece, with drag attack to move opposing fighters and the Illicium ki feat which allows you to change the target of a nearby attack to them. They also have the Hypnotic Gaze ki feat that takes an activation counter from an opponent and gives them a stun counter.</li>
<li>Himei - Himei is great at disengaging with their Slippery ki feat, and their Sonic Wave ranged attack can dish out stun counters. They're not great in melee, so keeping them at range is key to keeping them alive.</li>
<li>Fu Ran Ku - Fu can dish out a free Imbolised marker once per turn&nbsp;by entering&nbsp;base-to-base contact with enemies&nbsp;(or if if they enter base-to-base contact with them), and models in base-to-base contact during the starting phase also get one less activation counter. They don't have a movement value, but they can move 3 inches after performing any action. Fu only has 4 wounds, but durable means they only take 1 damage per attack. Be careful of them being surrounded by enemies, because once they get into base-to-base contact with a few of your opponent's fighters and start to shut them down, they'll be a target for removal.</li>
<li>Miyakomo's Echo (x2) - These super cheap crabs are there&nbsp;to sacrifice to keep Mother-of-Pearl alive. You can take 4, at 3 rice each, and Mother-of-Pearl can also generate them if enemies are taken out within their pulse range of their Tokkiko's Choice ki feat.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-deep-5.jpg?itok=xi0C_irm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-deep-5.jpg?itok=92FIIBKS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Electric Eel is also available to add to your The Deep warband, just be careful as they zap your own fighters as well.

<p>While The Deep theme does restrict many of the popular fighter choices from the Jung, there are a couple that still very much tie into the theme:</p>
<ul><li>Electric Eel - The Eel attacks anyone within range of its ranged attack whenever it moves, so send it off into groups of enemies and just walk around them for free attacks, just watch the positioning of your own fighters.</li>
<li>Miyakomo's Echo - These are the same profile as those from The Deep themed warband box, but 2 additional miniatures to allow you to include the 4 total you can take in your list.</li>
<li>Mitsukarina - The Juhin&nbsp;Mitsukarina is mentioned on The Deep theme card, but is not currently on the Bushido release schedule, so we can't even begin to guess what their profile will look like.</li>
</ul><p>GCT Studios has shared with us, early concept sketches for the next shark, which will have The Deep keyword for some extra bite for the warband.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-deep-7.jpg?itok=suGq2X0U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-deep-7.jpg?itok=ZM0j2W0K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>TechRaptor can exclusively reveal the concept sketches for the next Bushido Jung Pirates Shark (which will have the Deep keyword on their profile), The Goblin Shark!</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Deep?</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed testing The Deep for this article. They've got an interesting playstyle with the slow burn wound effects, while also looking to slow your opponent down with restrictive movement, and the Red Pearl is a great way to stop your opponent's key fighter (they'll be very careful about positioning and won't want to ever leave the exposed to multiple charges from your side). I love how it all ties into the theme of the underwater creatures, whilst limiting the units from the Jung that don't fit the theme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-deep-6.jpg?itok=WRniid8y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-deep-6.jpg?itok=kOMDq8Wy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's also a The Deep scenery pack available for <em>Bushido</em>. These complement the special cards that come in the warband pack and look a lot better on the tabletop than tokens and bases.

<p>If the playstyle of The Deep sounds appealing, then you absolutely should pick up The Deep themed warband box. The miniatures are great and really capture the underwear creature theme, all centered around the amazing-looking Mother-of-Pearl miniature. If you're a Jung player already, then although you won't be able to use all of your current fighters, the depth (pun intended) that The Deep adds to their games is fantastic and a real breath of fresh air (ok, I'll stop now).</p>

            <p>Earlier today, old man James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atomfall-plays-like-a-stalker-with-scouse-accents">wagged a finger at us all sternly for not writing about Atomfall before</a>. My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom 2024</a> story trailer? I mean, it's <em>only</em> a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. It's <em>only</em> got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me. </p><!--more-->

<p>The Spanish monastery in question is located high up in the Pyrenees, and inevitably reminds me of Umberto Eco homage <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/474030/The_Abbey_of_Crime_Extensum/">The Abbey Of Crime</a>. As with that Abbey, you'll experience it by day and by night, taking charge of five characters with different skillsets as you probe the monastery's secrets and search for an escape route. Time flows continuously, and the hour at hand determines the challenges and opportunities in store. The monastery doubles as a "madhouse" and an inquisitorial prison, which means it's full of unsympathetic guards, but it's much worse after curfew, which is when the resident ghosts come out.</p>
<p>The five prisoners form a Commandos-style squad. You'll need to pool their bespoke abilities to prevail. Agnes, for example, is a witch with an arsenal of spells and other occult devices. Amelia is a young thief who can pickpocket and place traps. Alfredo is a disgraced priest who can give eloquent sermons to draw a crowd, opening up gaps in the area surveillance. Leonora seems pretty deft with a blade. There's equipment and upgrades to factor in, too. While the aesthetic and premise suggest a more story-driven experience, this feels like a proper tactical sandbox.</p>
<p>The protagonists aren't unfazable drones, however. Each possesses "a fully realized set of traumas and phobias" that seemingly correspond to specific areas and encounters, together with a sanity bar. Deplete a character's sanity, and they may lapse into fullblown "paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence, fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played." <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">The Steam blurb</a> recommends that you avoid roaming around at night, because the monastery's parade of spooks will quickly erode your team's morale, but sometimes, of course, "the risk is worth the reward".</p>
<p>The game will offer two different campaigns, "each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises". It's out in 2025, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-design-as-conspiracy-theory-what-amnesia-learns-from-umberto-eco">speaking as both an Eco warrior</a> and a Goya head, I am keen. The screens and trailer suggest a tidy warren of variables, clues and awful mysteries, which you'll get to know over multiple failed breakout attempts. It's certainly a change of tune for The Game Kitchen, though the lurid palette and aura of religious horror are extremely Blasphemous. For a more upbeat spin on monks (and murder), the obvious choice is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>.</p>

Oblige me some good vibes today.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Concord is a 5v5 first-person shooter that follows Sony’s strategy with the phenomenally successful <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> by launching on PS5 and PC at the same time and with a cheaper price. However, early indications are that Concord is set to endure a tough time on PC, with extremely low Steam concurrent player numbers for pre-launch betas. Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers publicly available.</p><p>And so, there is a degree of concern about Concord as a viable live service as the game launches. But, according to Weisnewski: “we’re strapped in and ready to push it for years to come.”</p><p>Concord’s eight-year development suggests a significant investment from Sony and a degree of pressure on the game to perform. Indeed, Concord has one of the 15 animated shorts that make up Amazon’s recently announced anthology <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon">Secret Level</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But Concord is perhaps also yet another triple-A video game that has taken years to make and launches into an already crowded market drowning in live service shooters. The most high-profile casualty of this live service push in recent years is Rocksteady’s much-maligned <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, which flopped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">to the tune of $200 million</a> for publisher Warner Bros.</p><p>Sony itself has scaled back its live service ambitions following big investment. In November last year, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works</a>, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025. The following month, in December 2023, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>, its troubled attempt to create a live service version of its hugely popular franchise.</p><p>Then, in February this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">Sony announced a significant round of layoffs</a> affecting around 900 staff at its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs hit a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Firesprite, and, most significantly, PlayStation's London studio, which closed down. Alongside the layoffs, a number of in-development games were canceled. Last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">Sony-owned Bungie</a>, maker of the Destiny series, suffered devastating cuts, with its PvP-focused extraction shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> still in the works.</p><p>Amid ballooning development costs and protracted development periods, the video game industry is enduring the toughest time in recent memory, with tens of thousands laid off, multiple studio closures, and various games canceled.</p><p>As for Concord, fans are already pointing out that if development on the game began around eight years, then that lines up with when Blizzard's hero shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> blew up. </p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Remember that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unravel">Unravel</a> and its star: a cute lad made of yarn called Yarny? He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.</p>

<p>Hela's a co-op puzzley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> from the folks at Windup, whose founders include former members of Coldwood Interactive. It sees you and/or your pal inhabit the pads of a brave little mouse. Apparently you're a mouse because you're a witch's familiar and she needs your help, hence why you go out and explore the Scandinavian landscape and complete puzzles and the like.</p>
<p>From the trailer, all we really see is a lot of Just Cause-style flying over nice gardens, as well as the fact you've got a backpack that's a frog. And the frog can produce a long, elastic tongue that you can use to pull open slats or swing your or your pal to new heights. Otherwise, it seems your backpack can be used to store mushrooms and other treats, which can be brewed up into potions or upgrades.</p>
<p>That's really all we know, to be honest. But the devs tout the game as a "delightful mix of adventure and relaxation" where you'll perform "acts of kindness and feel their healing impact". Awww, how sweet. I can only imagine how other members of the animal kingdom would react, as I, an acts-of-kindness-giver, career towards them on a pink slide coated in frog saliva, to deliver a potion composed of mildew and a bit of dirt I found under a plant pot.</p>
<p>There's no release date for this one yet, but you can keep an eye on it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3161310/Hela/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There will be a multitude of different endings to discover when Avowed releases next year.</p>
<p>While at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, game director Carrie Patel was asked by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPvOB0cDZI">IGN</a> how many possible endings Obsidian's fantasy RPG will have. "Ooh, that's very hard to say," Patel replied, before adding: "I can tell you our ending slides number in the double digits, and you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them."  </p>
<p>Patel furthered: "This is an Obsidian game, so your ending really is the sum total of your choices across the game, across a lot of pieces of content depending on what you encountered and what you did when you found it."</p>

<p>The Avowed director went on to state the team has built the game and its gameplay to give players many different options to approaching things, such as with combat and their character.</p>
<p>"And, in terms of the storyline, there are really a lot of choices to be made too, about where your true loyalties lie, who your allegiance is with in the endgame," Patel continued. "We're really excited to see players explore those possibilities and just build their own story."</p>
<p>Later in the conversation, the developer said there won't be one true canon ending, as it's the player's "experience".</p>
<p>But despite this freedom, you can't go ahead and slaughter everyone. Patal said the team refrained from going with the "kill everybody approach", as while this can be a chaotic and fun way to play, Obsidian felt it could "create the game [it] wanted without that".</p>

<p>The problem doesn't seem to be isolated to one particular console type or territory, and a thread on the Ubisoft subreddit has received over 150 comments from players reporting the same issue.</p>
<p>"I'm dealing with the same thing. About a month ago, Ubi+ just all of a sudden stopped working on my Xbox and hasn't worked since," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1esd65w/comment/li5vu31/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reported</a> one commenter.</p>
<p>"I gave it a few days to hopefully fix itself, and when it didn't, I eventually opened a ticket with Ubisoft support. After dealing with some truly idiotic customer support reps (or maybe AI?) they finally 'escalated' my issue and told me a team is aware of the issue and is working on it.</p>
<p>"It's been about 3 weeks. My ticket was closed and no more info has been provided, but it's still not working. I've cancelled the service and have about a week of time left, but I will have paid for a month+ of it being non-functional."</p>
<p>"We need this to be louder they won't add this to the known issue status on their website," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1esd65w/comment/liqipcb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another.</p>
<p>"They won't offer refunds for people who paid a year. I don't think they're really fixing this issue. I won't let the ticket close every two days. I will make a comment on their support chat to keep my ticket up because it's been too long, and is totally ridiculous of our hard-earned money to go to something that's not even working. I really wish we pushed a little harder on Ubisoft to fix this issue."</p>

<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, Ubisoft said that it was "aware of a technical issue affecting a small number of players' ability to link their Ubisoft+ subscription with Xbox and are investigating."</p>
<p>Affected players are encouraged to reach out to customer support <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/help/contact">here</a>.</p>
<p>"We will share an update with impacted players as soon as possible," Ubisoft added.</p>
<p>In related Ubisoft news, we recently learned that whilst the publisher/developer is set to release the latest entry in its long-running Assassin's Creed series in a few months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-hints-at-longer-assassins-creed-development-times-ahead-of-shadows-debut">future games in the series will see a longer development time</a>.</p>
<p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches this November, it will have been in development for four years. This will mark the longest development period for the series to date, coming in at a year longer than that of previous series tentpole <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> (which released in 2020).</p>
<p>However, according to Shadows' lead producer Karl Onnée, four years is "the right balance to go from conception to production and get the feedback necessary to adapt" an Assassin's Creed game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're feeling very rested and at peace today, I do not recommend you play the demo for just-announced puzzle game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wilmot-works-it-out">Wilmot Works It Out</a>. It will relax you so much that you gently petrify. Future archaeologists will marvel at you, a smiling stone figure in the ruins of a bygone civilisation. "What exactly was going on back in 2024 to inspire such a critical intensity of chillax?" they will wonder. Then, they will spot the computer screen glowing beneath its layer of dust, and the cycle will begin anew.</p><!--more-->

<p>Wilmot Works It Out is, of course, the sequel to Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wilmots-warehouse">Wilmot's Warehouse</a>, again published by Finji. That game was about organising a warehouse. This game is about doing picture puzzles, around 60 in total. The puzzles are delivered to Wilmot's doorstep by an affable postwoman. You drag each parcel into the middle of his house and shake out a jumble of rounded squares, then set about sliding them together. Then you hang the picture on your wall, and the postwoman shows up with another picture. The sound is immediately blissful: the soft click of tiles meeting, the plop of a completed picture settling into place, the laidback escalation of the piano accompaniment.</p>
<p>The original Wilmot's Warehouse is one of our favouritest puzzle games, earning double Brendawards for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-nicest-smiles-in-pc-games">Nicest Smile</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-7-best-couriers-in-pc-games">Best Courier</a>. It made Matt (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wilmots-warehouse-is-a-language-game-please-discuss">write about Wittgenstein</a>. In our 2019 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wilmots-warehouse-review">review</a>, Nate called it "a deceptively simple little organism", and I wonder if the same is true of Wilmot Works It Out. Based on a few moments with the demo, it seems a lot less fiddly than the previous game: there's no time limit, and the whole thing is framed as a break from Wilmot's warehouse job. Wilmot's Sunday Afternoon, if you will.</p>
<p>I sense, however, that there's more going on beneath the surface. Perhaps it'll have something to do with the way successive delivery parcels mix up pieces from different puzzles. Or maybe complexity will arise from the unlocking of "new rooms and customisation items to decorate with".</p>
<p>Even if it proves as straightforward as it seems, Wilmot Works It Out is already a lovely creation that saturates the veins with calm. It's also out quite soon on 23rd October. Find out more and sample the demo for yerself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060590/Wilmot_Works_It_Out/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>The once Xbox console exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> has reportedly sold in excess of 1m copies on PlayStation 5. Plenty of sales and sails, really!</p>
<p>This figure comes from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/phil-spencer-we-have-more-xbox-console-players-than-ever-as-fans-question-microsofts-multi-platform-strategy">Windows Central</a>'s sources, with reporter Jez Corden noting that given the game's $40 pricing, that makes for "around $40m dollars additional revenue (minus platform fees of course) for Rare to hire and invest in growing that game out".</p>
<p>On its release on PlayStation earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">Sea of Thieves topped the PS5 sales charts</a> in Europe. Prior to its move over to PlayStation, the Sea of Thieves team also revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-sails-across-impressive-player-milestone-ahead-of-ps-debut">40 million of us had embraced our inner pirate</a> and set sail since the game's debut across Xbox and PC (where it is also available on Game Pass).</p>

<p>Along with Sea of Thieves, Microsoft has released a number of its other games on both PlayStation and Switch. Most recently, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be releasing on PS5</a>, after a brief period of Xbox Series X console exclusivity.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> spoke more on the company's decision to bring one of its biggest first-party games to Sony's console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-indiana-jones-ps5-launch-news-by-saying-xbox-is-a-business">stating Xbox is "a business"</a>, and that "the bar is high in terms of the delivery we have to give back" to parent company Microsoft.</p>

IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/15/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Pocket Camp is a true-to-series Animal Crossing adaptation that delivers plenty of reasons to take this camping trip.”</p><p>The game goes dark on November 29, 2024, a week after its seventh birthday. Since service began on November 21, 2017, for approximately seven years we have been honored to see everyone's lovely, diverse campsites grow and flourish,” <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/categories/35735633685657-Notice-Regarding-the-End-of-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo said in a statement</a>.</p><p>“We extend our heartfelt thanks to the many users who have loved Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Screens  -  Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</h3></div></output><p>After the online service ends, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp will no longer be playable, Nintendo warned. There is a silver lining, however. Nintendo said it’s developing a paid version of the app to which players will be able to transfer their save data. This offline version will be released during the same period as the end of service for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Nintendo said.</p><p>The paid version will have the same basic gameplay and controls as Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. However, this app will allow the player to use the included features with a one-time purchase, Nintendo said. There will be no in-app purchases or subscription services (like Pocket Camp Club).</p><p>It’s worth noting that since this app will not require a continuous online connection, some features that require that connection, e.g. Market Boxes, gifts, and visiting other players' campsites will not be available. Similarly, Leaf Tickets will not be usable, and you will not be able to transfer them to the new app. Expect pricing and a release date in October.</p><p>Reaction from fans is mixed, with some expressing sadness that Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is coming to an end, others seeing the positives in the paid app.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Literally same! this game has been like the sole constant in my life these past 7 years, its gotten me through the end my teen years, my associates and bachelors degrees, and every crazy thing in between. I actually cried when I saw the pop up 😔 (also! we’re close in game days!) <a href="https://t.co/sQoBTDR1zx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sQoBTDR1zx</a></p>— Ana 🌘 (@Go_Away_Ana) <a href="https://twitter.com/Go_Away_Ana/status/1826519352172015672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Honestly it's fantastic that you are releasing an offline version instead of just deleting everything. This way long time players can keep playing. Most mobile games will come to an end eventually, this is just the best case scenario for such an event.</p>— Gay Bowser (@SoL0ngGayBowser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoL0ngGayBowser/status/1826507204020613302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Nintendo has had mixed results from its mobile game efforts, which include Super Mario Run, Mario Kart Tour, and Pikmin Bloom. In 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-mobile-no-games-in-development">Nintendo was reported to be retreating from the mobile gaming market</a>. That apparent decision came amid the explosive, pandemic-fueled popularity of Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. However, there are a number of successful Pokémon mobile games, such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-october">more in the works</a>.</p><p>Animal Crossing fans are already wondering what's next in the franchise, following Pocket Camp's demise and New Horizons seemingly a distant memory at Nintendo. Perhaps a brand new Animal Crossing for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> is in the works? given the enormous popularity of New Horizons, it feels like an inevitability.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">revealed earlier this week</a>, during Gamescom Opening Night Live. While the developer has still kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps, it has since confirmed the game will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on release.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team shared on social media platform X. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>

<p>The news was met with plenty of praise from fellow X users, as it had previously been unclear whether these options would be implemented on release.</p>
<p>As you may have already surmised given the game's name and Mafia's post mentioned the 1900s setting, The Old Country is set to take players further back in time than previous Mafia releases. It will feature a "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of... Sicily" with players needing to "fight to survive in this dangerous and unforgiving era".</p> <div>

		<p>Tripwire Presents and developer Ice Code Games have revealed that their turn-based tactical roguelite Rogue Waters will launch on 30th September 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Waters Announcement Trailer | Gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_1hKVw1ksw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tripwire Interactive are best known for their Killing Floor series, but their Tripwire Presents publishing label is picking up and promoting indie tiles. Rogue Waters is one of these early publishing partnerships, working with Hard West 2 developer Ice Code Games.</p>
<p>This is a seafaring turn-based roguelike that will have you venture into the supernatural pirate seas, filled with giant sea monsters and enemies to battle. You’ll actually &nbsp;be able to call upon these classic monsters to fight by your side – albeit in somewhat limited fashion – while also engaging in tactical combat that puts a great deal of emphasis on positioning and controlling the space as your swashbuckling raiders swing onto the decks of enemy ships. There’s also island-based battles and turn-based ship combat with targeted cannon fire.</p>
<p>“Bringing Rogue Waters to life has been a real adventure,” said Mateusz Pilski, Ice Code’s VP of Development. “Our goal in creating games is always to contribute to the genre in ways that bring players more satisfaction and fun in tackling tactical challenges. Dynamic melee combat which recreates the dance-like fencing bouts of boarding actions, combines immersion with thoughtful planning.”</p>

<p>We’ve just been hands on with the game at Gamescom – we’ve also played Killing Floor 3, by the way – and there’s a really interesting blend of precise tactical options at play. Look out for our preview in the next week or so!</p>
<p>Looking back on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/hard-west-2-review/">Hard West 2</a>, we said in our review, “Hard West 2 comes with an enjoyably aggressive twist on XCOM-like turn-based combat, and with a fun way of upgrading your characters alongside, but it’s wrapped up in world exploration and characterisation that just leaves me wanting to get back in the fight. There’s a lot of fun to be had in Hard West 2, even if it’s not blowing minds as a complete package.”</p>

            <p>A member of Firewalk's development team has revealed Concord - PlayStation's new 5v5 sci-fi shooter - was in development for "around" eight years.</p>
<p>A post on social media platform X by Concord lead character designer Jon Weisnewski celebrating the game's launch confirmed this little titbit, with the developer stating he had been working on it personally for about five of those years.</p>
<p>"We don't get a lot of Launch Days in our careers so today is special for a ton of reasons," Weisnewski wrote. "Oblige me some good vibes today." The developer went on to state the entire team was "strapped in and ready to push it for years to come".</p>

<p>Prior to its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-lays-out-concord-live-service-roadmap-commits-to-at-least-three-seasons">Firewalk laid out a roadmap for Concord</a>, sharing plans to keep the game fresh for at least three seasons. In July, the studio also revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-next-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass">the game won't have a battle pass</a>, stating: "You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."</p>
<p>"Concord feels like a load of brilliant games combined - but is that enough?" Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>. "The true hook with Concord, I suspect, will reveal itself once it's in the hands of its audience, as they wrestle with optimal combinations and strategies and the meta begins to congeal."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-concord-is-a-technically-solid-well-made-hero-shooter-with-much-potential">Digital Foundry, meanwhile</a>, has dubbed Concord a "technically solid, well-made hero shooter" with "potential".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A big reason is being invited into a position of creative trust on a new experience. Obviously it’s a group effort, and having a seat at the table with others who inspire you and push you to do your best is a tremendous privilege. That trust gave the game so much identity.</p>— NEWSK (@sharkeatsman) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122886689731027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>This week's release of Concord, along with its development time and post-launch commitment, made me think of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog's cancelled standalone The Last of Us multiplayer</a>.</p>
<p>On its cancellation, the studio - which had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-multiplayer-cancellation-reportedly-wasnt-a-bloodless-endeavour">reportedly been working on the game for four years</a> - said when faced with the choice to become a "solely live service games studio" or continuing "to focus on single-player narrative games" it chose the latter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-we-finally-played-obsidians-first-person-rpg-and-its-fantastic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Avowed was a surprising delight to play for the first time. After a lot of questions about the shift in art direction from the teaser trailer, questions about the length, and a combat demo on the Xbox stage that had many asking if the game was earlier in development than expected, I’m happy to report that Avowed is feeling great, looking great, and offering a compelling story based on the early slice I played at an event.</p><p>My journey began just after the opening main mission in Avowed, and we’ve been sent on a task to find an Aedyran Expedition team. It turns out, as it often does with RPGs, that fate had other plans for them. Kai, our green-skinned companion who just happens to be voiced by Mass Effect’s Garrus Vakarian actor Brandon Keener, keeps things light-hearted with quips and remarks about this new area we’re exploring. The banter is welcome and sparse, only chiming in occasionally to make a quip, like when I paused to admire the view.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And the view is very pretty. Avowed has done a great job leaning into the art style the larger Pillars of Eternity series is known for and had me stopping to admire waterfalls in the distance and moss-covered structures that set the aesthetic tone for this mysterious cavern we are diving deeper into. Avowed’s world design is shaping up nicely too, and as I dove deeper I would discover walls that could be blown up to traverse a new path, or puzzles that would open a secret new area with a large chest if I threw my shock explosives at a few tucked away circuits I found by exploring off the beaten path, only to find a hole in the wall. These puzzles have the added bonus of revealing coveted loot like a powerful ring that would offer some choice stat bonuses for my character.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Avowed has done a great job leaning into the art style the larger Pillars of Eternity series is known for.</p></div><p>When I wasn’t exploring the depths of the oceanic cave I had to swim through it only to find myself facing off against a Xaurip. These are Lizard-like creatures with your standard human weapons like swords, shields, and bows, and they make for good fodder as you learn your beginning attacks. Combat in Avowed is much better than I had anticipated. You quickly become accustomed to using flasks to regenerate not just your health, but more importantly your essence, which allows the execution of your most powerful attacks. As the barbarian, I found myself stalking spiders in the caverns and plotting my attack. To begin, I use Kai’s ability Fire and Ice via the radial wheel you access by holding down the left bumper (if you’re playing with a gamepad, obviously). Fire and Ice sees Kai Teleport to the target and then unload a powerful bullet into the spider’s Chelicerae, aka its face. Then I command him to use his area of effect attack, Leap of Daring, that has him slam into the ground and briefly stun everyone around him. During that time I’d been closing the gap, and using the two weapons I first charged up my right-handed axe which offers a powerful attack that inflicts frost damage accumulation to nearby enemies. After holding the right trigger to empower this attack I manage to freeze my opponents for just a moment. Then I unleash my more powerful essence abilities. First I shout to push back the smaller spiders who are also surrounding me, and while stunned, I then select charge and ram my body with force into the biggest guy in the room. Then, I follow it up with a flurry of blows with the left trigger, which holds my nimble sword for a small flurry of strikes that results in the dispatch of the last spider standing in the room.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Later, I would return as a mage, which was described as the most difficult of the three classes available to use. Abilities for this character included an ethereal staff that you could materialize with essence, orb projectiles that would track your target, and standard attacks that had you flicking your wand to and fro while smaller spells did damage to your target. Additional Essense abilities included a spear that was a bit faster than the staff (as you’d expect), and several different protection or buff spells to help your hits land with a bit harder thud. My personal favorite, however, was an ability that had you snap your book of magic shut to send a wave of damage-dealing aura at everything around you. It just looked cool seeing a book wreck everything in the immediate vicinity.</p><p>Make no mistake though, combat was also challenging. I was chugging potions with recklessness as I knew this was just a demo, but it was clear that you’ll need to master the balance between your spell casting, defense, and gear options for maximum efficiency. Digging into the menus, I found that you could spec out your character with a 2nd weapon set that would be accessed with the press of the Y button on the controller. The potential that something so simple offers had me excited because with one press you could access a significantly different playstyle. Combat felt clean, intuitive, and had a depth I didn’t expect. I can’t wait to dive into it more. And fortunately, the oomph of your attack animations that many felt were missing from a demo on the Xbox stage earlier this year have seemingly been implemented; enemies react how you’d expect them to when you slash them with a sword or blast them with a spell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Eventually, on our journey, Kai and I would run into Caedmon, a young explorer who had managed to survive the Xaurip assault. His friends from the expedition team weren’t so lucky, however. After lamenting that he’s “never touched a girl” and his looming fate wasn’t fair, we were given several conversation options:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>“Kai, we can’t let this kid die a virgin. Can you help him?”</li><li>“Give Caedmon a healing option. Let’s get you back on your feet!”</li><li>“Toughen up kid. I’m not wasting my supplies on you.”</li></ul><p>I, of course, picked the top one.</p><p>Kai responded: “Not with that… OH you mean with healing him.” He would then go on to make me offer my potion instead. Caedmon was back on his feet and offered us some advice that would help us continue our journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But because I also wanted to try out combat as a Mage, I got to see what happened if you always picked the bottom option. “Toughen up Kid!” my character shouted. Caedmon said something Kai called nonsense, and pleaded with me to help him. I however refused to offer him the life saving potion, resulting in his immediate death. Did I loot his corpse? You’re damn right I did.</p><p>It’s situations like this that will make Avowed really stand out if they are plentiful enough. Can you really be that evil? Apparently so, and I look forward to doing a sane-person playthrough where I don’t murder everyone if I can avoid it, and a playthrough where I’m the biggest jerk possible because… well, that’s where the fun lies now, isn’t it?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The demo ended with an encounter where we met Sargamis. Sargamis is a gold-skinned deity-like creature who sent us to find an item and return it. But like our explorer friends from earlier in the demo, there were other plans afoot and it wasn’t long until we came face-to-face with the Skeleton boss and a pesky Skeleton priest that would heal the large group of enemies we were facing off against. This was all triggered immediately after getting to the object Sargamis sent us to retrieve, to which Kai quipped, “It can’t be this easy… can it?” No, Kai, it apparently cannot be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Can you really be that evil in Avowed? Apparently so.</p></div><p>Once in battle and realizing I was greatly outnumbered, I ran out of the room to survey the battlefield. After taking out a few of the lower rank-and-file skeletons just outside of the priest’s healing aura, I identified the one thwarting my plans of murder (can you murder a skeleton?) and I turned his bones to ice and dust. Just as I had cleared the grunts, I was finally ready to take on the Skeleton boss with Kai, but just as I had him on the ropes…. The power in the building went out for everyone playing the demo.</p><p>It’s OK, though, because Avowed had made its impression. My doubts about it have faded away, and I’m left excited for its release in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room">February</a>. This small slice Obsidian gave us the opportunity to play was a treat, and while it’s a tiny glimpse, our 50-minute demo session flew by in the blink of an eye. And that’s always a good sign.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-story-gives-players-personalized-video-ahead-of-war-within<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marketing is coming at players in full force with <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>'s impending launch. This brand new expansion for the undying MMORPG might give you a hankering to jump back in, but before doing so, you should check out this neat website -- <a href="https://warcraftstory.com/">Warcraft Story </a>-- Blizzard made to welcome players back.</p>
<p><a href="https://warcraftstory.com/">Warcraft Story</a> is an official <em>World of Warcraft</em> website that searches "over 20 years of game data" and creates a personalized video chronicling some neat stats on your character. It takes several minutes to load, and while you're waiting for the video to conjure up, a loading screen chronicles some other miscellaneous stats like quests completed and total deaths.</p>
<p>My main since <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, for instance, has completed a whopping 7,000 quests. It also talks about critters killed, number of deaths, et cetera, but let's not talk about those too much so as not to embarrass myself.</p>

<p>As a result of the loading, players are met with a video narrated by <em>The War Within</em>'s villain, Xal'atath. She narrates a short clip featuring your character's achievements (or failures). In one video for my Mag'har Hunter, she commended me for the amount of raid bosses I defeated. And apparently, I've cheered 83 times on this character. I definitely need to bump up those numbers!</p>
<p>From what I can tell, videos can vary, even for the same character as I got two different ones for my Troll Mage. Though Xal'atath made note of my class in both videos, I was met with different stats like how many kills I had on the prior expansion's first major boss, Raszageth, as well as how many times I've died to gravity.</p>
<p>While your own, personalized Warcraft Story could definitely merit being longer, it's a fun little tool to have in the background and see what it comes up with. If you're the type of player who has stuck around with <em>World of Warcraft</em> since the early days, it's a nice little incentive to jump back into things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new expansion is less than a week away, too<em>: World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> launches on August 26, 2024.</p>

Survive an undead plague in a painstakingly recreated medieval market town. <a title="Series > Mana [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge your needs, master physics-based mechanics, and evade the horde for as long as you can.</p><p><em>God Save Birmingham</em> is a zombie apocalypse survival game set in 14th century Birmingham, England. The Early Access version will focus on a sandbox mode utilizing a small portion of the town. The full town will be available at official release, with a campaign mode coming later to complete the experience.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>The End Has Come</strong> – A strange plague sweeps the countryside, transforming men into monsters, and cities into slaughterhouses. You are one of the last survivors of Birmingham, alone against the shambling corpses of your former friends and neighbors, with only your wits to protect you.</li><li><strong>Nourish Thy Body</strong> – Even after the end of the world, life goes on. Forage for supplies, craft tools and weapons, then set out on the hunt for food, water, and shelter. The clock is always ticking, and the horde is always near.</li><li><strong>Master Medieval Physics</strong> – Wriggle your way out of harrowing situations with physics-based mechanics that reward quick wits and skill. Stack furniture to barricade doors, leap low fences to trip your clumsy foes, and sever limbs to reduce the undead to angry, wriggling torsos. Just be careful not to stumble over a bucket while fleeing for your life.</li><li><strong>Take a Bite Out of History</strong> – Explore a carefully reconstructed 14th century Birmingham, in all its bucolic, bubonic glory. Stop by the Markets or the Burgage Plots to forage for resources. Raid boarded-up smithies for tools, grab a drink at the nearest tavern, and explore historic architecture at the Church of St. Martin in the Bull Ring.</li></ul><p>The Early Access version of the game will contain about one-quarter of the entire town, with the rest coming between the Early Access and full releases.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="God Save Birmingham - Official Game Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jmeG7DHhcTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the worst aspects of current, toxic video game discourse has been the idea that, at any given moment, every single video game can and must have its playerbase statistically scrutinised. If the number of people playing a game is ever found to be an unacceptable number, then I'm afraid that's it. That game is in trouble. Maybe even dead.</p><p>Whether it's the press or an irate group of fans making the call, the process involved in this kangaroo court is normally the same: people take a look on Steam and console charts, see how many folks are playing a game, then report on their findings, usually as some kind of proof that the game is "dead".</p><p>Here is a prominent example from November 2023:</p><p>Aside from other issues with this headline--what do you mean "Could be", who's making the call here?--let's break this down. <em>Starfield </em>was released on September 6, means it had been out for almost three months at the time of that tweet. It's a singleplayer video game, one with huge preorder/launch week interest that subsequently reviewed...not poorly, but not what Bethesda would have been expecting or hoping for, either. It would have taken most players around 20-30 hours to finish up, and while a few obsessives will always play longer trying to rinse it, and there will always be a trickle of new players, for the vast majority of people taking part in online discourse about video games in November 2023, <em>Starfield </em>was done.</p><p>So of course its player numbers plummeted. It's not a live service or multiplayer game! If we were tracking the number of people playing <em>Destiny </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, games specifically reliant on the number of people playing them, then sure, surges and drops in that count are important. But <em>Starfield </em>is a singleplayer video game! Most people who bought it are done with it. This is normal, and the fact it has been turned into <em>something </em>here is weird and gross.</p><p>Anyone concerned with a singleplayer video game's player count has been live service-pilled. The AAA video game industry's insistence that every major video game must now be played forever--<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look at the death march <em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>subjected players to</a>--has begun soaking into the wider consciousness, and so when a game fails to hold our interest for months on end, it's somehow--for the live service-pilled among us, anyway--now seen as a failure.</p><p>Speaking of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, its latest release, <em>Mirage</em>, is another game I've seen subjected to the same kind of scrutiny, and for the same deranged reasons.<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/n24527/assassins-creed-mirage-one-month-player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Here's a story with the headline "Assassin's Creed Mirage has big 68% drop in PS5 players in first month"</a>, which then goes onto...spell out the exact reason for this, namely that it's a singleplayer game in a busy time of the year for video game releases. And here's GameSpot<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-phantom-liberty-launch-cyberpunk-2077s-player-count-leaves-starfield-in-the-dust/1100-6517999/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> not just talking about <em>Cyberpunk 2077's</em> player count, but using that number as a stick to beat <em>Starfield </em>with</a>. Two different games, unrelated to each other except for the fact they're singleplayer video releases.</p><p>More recently, here's PCGamesN making note of what looks like a huge drop in <em>Black Myth: Wukong's</em> playerbase, a game that has only been out<em> for a few days</em>:</p><p>If you're a games writer, you don't need to be worrying about this shit! If you're a normal person taking part in video game discussions, you <em>definitely </em>do not need to be worrying about this shit. At best you're doing a AAA publisher's work in helping condition people to the idea all games must be played forever, and at worst you're doing your part in propagating toxic tribalism in video game fandom.</p><p>What you could be doing instead of scrutinizing numbers is enjoying a singleplayer video game for what it is, then getting on with your lives. Indeed, that's the best way to enjoy them!</p><p><em>This article was originally published in November 2023. It has been updated with more recent examples. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
