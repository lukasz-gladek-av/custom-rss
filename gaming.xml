		<p>Tango Gameworks has been brought back to life after it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">unceremoniously shut down by Microsoft back in May</a>, alongside Arkane Austin. The revival comes about through publisher Krafton, which has acquired Tango Gameworks and the Hi-Fi Rush IP, paving the way for more games including a possible sequel.</p>
<p>In a statement, Krafton said, <em>“As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;Hi-Fi RUSH&nbsp;IP and explore future projects. KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans. There will be no impact on the existing game catalog of&nbsp;The Evil Within,&nbsp;The Evil Within 2,&nbsp;Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original&nbsp;Hi-Fi RUSH&nbsp;game, and they will remain available everywhere they are available today.This integration reinforces KRAFTON’s dedication to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio with innovative and high-quality content. The addition of Tango Gameworks represents a strategic alignment with KRAFTON’s mission to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment.”</em></p>


<p>Krafton has not acquired the rights to The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo by the looks of things, and these remain under the Microsoft/Bethesda umbrella. In the future, we may see Tango Gameworks commissioned for The Evil Within 3 depending on if a deal could be struck, otherwise it appears Tango Gameworks will be working on Hi-Fi Rush and its own other projects.</p>

<p>In our Hi-Fi Rush review, Dom said,<em> “Hi-Fi Rush is an utterly beguiling new take on rhythm-action, combining some of this generation’s most impressive visuals with music and mayhem.”</em></p>

            <p>PUBG publisher Krafton has acquired developer Tango Gameworks and the rights to Hi-Fi Rush, marking the company's first "significant investment" in the Japanese video game market.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks, which is also known for the likes of the Evil Within series, was founded by Shinji Mikami in 2010. In 2012, Bethesda parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resi-evil-creator-mikami-joins-zenimax">ZeniMax Media purchased Tango</a>, before it was then itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">acquired by Microsoft</a> years later.</p>
<p>Under Microsoft, Tango surprise launched Hi-Fi Rush in 2023 to wide acclaim, with the rhythm action release becoming a highlight in the Xbox Series X/S catalogue. Our Ed called the Xbox console exclusive both "vibrant and self-assured" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's own Hi-Fi Rush review</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>When Microsoft subsequently announced in May <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">it was closing several Bethesda studios</a> - including Dishonored developer Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games along with Tango Gameworks - shockwaves were felt through the industry. Many were quick to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">condemn this move by Microsoft</a>, with Arkane Lyon boss Dinga Bakaba calling it a "fucking gut stab".</p>
<p>However, Tango Gameworks will now live on thanks to today's news that Krafton has acquired both the studio and the Hi-Fi Rush brand.</p>
<p>"As part of this strategic agreement, Krafton intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi Rush IP and explore future projects," a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/fr/KRAFTON-Strengthens-Global-Presence-Through-Strategic-Integration-of-T">press release</a> on today's acquisition reads.</p>
<p>Krafton said it will support the team at Tango Gameworks to "continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans". The publisher noted there will be "no impact on the existing game catalogue of The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original Hi-Fi Rush game" as part of this acquisition.</p>
<p>"This integration reinforces Krafton's dedication to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio with innovative and high-quality content," the release continues. Krafton said the addition of Tango Gameworks is part of the company's "mission to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment".</p><p>

Celebrating the news on social media platform X, Tango Gameworks creative director <a href="https://x.com/johnjohanas/status/1822804769699946697">John Johanas</a> wrote: "We're back, baby!"

<p>Back in June, Xbox's Matt Booty spoke more on the then-closure of Tango Gameworks, and, while he did not name names, the exec <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">implied a change in leadership at the Hi-Fi Rush studio was a factor in Microsoft's decision</a>.</p>
<p>"I think the thing to be considered is that for us, it's as much a forward looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game... There are a lot of things that go into success for a game. You know, what leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously," Booty said at the time.</p>
<p>"And we have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves, are we set up for success going forward? And while there may have been factors and situations that previously led to success, they may not all still be in place as you look at what you're doing going forward."</p>
<p>Booty seemed to be referring - at least in part - to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">departure of Shinji Mikami from the studio last year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure</a> of Tango Gameworks by Microsoft was arguably one of the most disappointing news gamers had to read in 2024. The studio released several successful games, such as the two The Evil Within titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostwire-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the latter of which won several awards. However, Hi-Fi Rush wasn't as successful as Microsoft had hoped from a commercial standpoint, even after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> on PlayStation 5. Thus, the decision to divest.</p>
<p>Gamers thought it was over for the Tokyo-based developer originally founded by Resident Evil guru Shinji Mikami. Thankfully, that won't be the case: KRAFTON, once known as Bluehole Studio before the runaway success of PUBG, has just announced the acquisition of Tango Gameworks as well as the Hi-Fi Rush IP. The press release issued this morning also mentions that the existing development team will largely be kept in place. Hi-Fi Rush and The Evil Within 2 Director John Johanas already <a href="https://x.com/johnjohanas/status/1822804769699946697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated </a>on Twitter/X.</p>
<p>Here's the excerpt:</p>
<p><em>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi RUSH IP and explore future projects. KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans. There will be no impact on the existing game catalog of The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original Hi-Fi RUSH game.</em></p>
<p>Sadly for horror fans, it doesn't sound like rights to The Evil Within and/or Ghostwire: Tokyo franchises are included in the deal, whose financial details remain undisclosed at this time. However, that doesn't mean KRAFTON can't reach an agreement with Microsoft later; it would certainly be preferable rather than abandoning these prized IPs to languish for all eternity.</p>

            <p>There are times when I think each week's most intriguing new PC releases are being organised behind the scenes by a fiendishly plotting, Left 4 Dead-style "AI Director". Mostly, the games approach in small groups distributed evenly among the weekdays - a steady assault. But every now and then, they treacherously mass and pounce on one particular day. This week, it's the latter.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 12th August, mockingly empty alleyways and the sound of weeping. On Tuesday 13th August, the wordy wizarding of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/leximan">Leximan</a> (which still has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2017200/Leximan/">Steam demo</a>). On Wednesday 14th August, a distant fell chorus and a lifting of the neck hairs. And then, on Thursday 15th August, the onslaught begins: the early access launch of laidback factory sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a>, the parsing, pointing and clicking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crimson-diamond">The Crimson Diamond</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/">also has a Steam demo</a>), the bloody fisticuffs and llama-based exploration of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arco">Arco</a> (Steam demo? Yes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366970/Arco/">Steam demo</a>), the blithe town-building of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gourdlets">Gourdlets</a> (no Steam demo for this one... ah, just messing - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2013730/Gourdlets/">here it is</a>), the madcap musical toys of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddada">ODDADA</a> (you might want to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627870/ODDADA/">Steam demo</a>?), the avian mischief of Just Crow Things (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537920/Just_Crow_Things/">Steam demo</a>, yes), and the Steam release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2">Sins Of A Solar Empire 2</a> (shockingly demo-less).</p>
<p>Did you think it was over? Best regroup with team-mates, for the Director has held a few zombos in reserve. On Friday 16th August, a concluding foursome of the fun, the fearful and the forlorn: woebegone sheepdog odyssey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farewell-north">Farewell North</a>, pint-sized Zeldalike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castaway">Castaway</a>, cosmic junk salesman <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479840/Pawn_Planet/">Pawn Planet</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2332260/Feed_the_Deep/">Feed The Deep</a>, a Lovecraftian roguelike from the Fruit Ninja dev. As ever, all the week's new releases are sponsored by The Maw, an endlessly ugly embodiment of the universe's yearning for the New. You can follow our efforts to manage and mollify the creature in the news liveblog below. Have a jolly week!</p><div data-live="true">

<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, which was released in 2016, is experiencing a monumental surge in popularity on Steam. It has skyrocketed into second place on the ‘top sellers’ list, being surpassed only by Counter-Strike 2 and effortlessly walking by Black Ops 6. This is all thanks to the H2M Mod that’s being released this week, which is a Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer revival mod that uses MW Remastered as a foundation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-back">Take Me Back</h2>



<p>The H2M Mod is ambitious, porting the entirety of Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform into Modern Warfare Remastered. This includes every map, mode, weapon, and even some new content such as maps using single-player environments as a basis. It’s a free-to-play mod, but it requires that you own Modern Warfare Remastered on Steam if you want to play it – hence the resurgence.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Top Sellers list</a>, Modern Warfare Remastered sits in second place – provided you don’t count the Steam Deck as a game. In 2016, MWR hit an all-time high on the platform of just 1,409 users, and it’s widely believed that the release of the H2M Mod will allow the game to exceed that record.</p>



<p>While Activision released a remastered version of the Modern Warfare 2 (2009) campaign several years ago, it stripped the multiplayer offering from the game, leaving players worldwide disappointed. This revival-focused mod brings the game back to life in a glorious form, and the gameplay that has been shown so far looks intensely authentic.</p>



<p>The H2M Mod will be released on August 16.</p>

<p>It’s becoming something of a trend for CDL teams to perform a rebrand. As we head into the 2025 season, only <strong>four </strong>teams retain their ‘original’ branding from when the Call of Duty League was founded in 2020 – every other team has either migrated across the country (or moved to another continent) or been acquired by another organisation and gained a new face entirely.</p>



<p>Most recently, Seattle Surge emerged with a rebrand, with the organisation revealing it’ll be known as Vancouver Surge going forward, aligning more closely with the brand’s parent company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brand-alignment">Brand Alignment</h2>



<p>Not much has been said by the firm regarding this change, but it’s widely believed that the squad has been rebranded to ‘Vancouver Surge’ to align closely with the Aquilini Group, which is the org’s parent company. This firm, headed by Francesco Aquilini, also owns the Vancouver Canucks, a team competing in the NHL. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, the Aquilini Group owns a range of properties, hotels, and companies across Canada, with a focus on managing an estate across Vancouver.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This means that a second team will call Canada home, with Toronto Ultra having existed since the birth of the CDL. It’s unknown how this change will impact the team beyond an amendment to the branding, but it’s expected that the 2025 CDL season will begin and things will roll on as normal – but it might mean that we get a Major in Vancouver next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-microsoft-krafton-bought-sold<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's <a href="https://aftermath.site/layoffs-are-the-vibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been such a year/four years in the video game industry, so full of mergers and closures and layoffs</a>, that we've conditioned ourselves to flinch reflexively at any kind of announcement that's made from the business side of things. Imagine our surprise, then, when an email landed in our inboxes tonight with news that seemed...good?</p><p>The email, a press release, said that Krafton (publishers of <em>PUBG</em>) had bought both Tango Gameworks and the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> IP from Microsoft, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hi-fi-rush-review-bomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saving both from the dustbin of history</a>. Here's the meat of it:</p><blockquote><p>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi RUSH IP</em>&nbsp;and explore future projects. KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans. There will be no impact on the existing game catalog of&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, and the original&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi RUSH</em>&nbsp;game.</p><p>This integration reinforces KRAFTON’s dedication to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio with innovative and high-quality content. The addition of Tango Gameworks represents a strategic alignment with KRAFTON's mission to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That's about as good as it gets, right? The studio is saved, and there's even explicit mention made of both <em>Hi-Fi Rush's</em> continuity and work on future projects (Tango also being well-known for <em>Evil Within</em> and <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>).</p><p>Now, none of us know how this will shake out in the longterm, hence the asterisk in the headline. Maybe the next <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> game will be an exploitative mobile release, maybe Tango and Krafton leadership will clash, there's an infinite number of ways this whole thing can go bad.</p><p>But there are also ways it can go <em>well</em>. Like if Krafton looked at Tango's past, looked at <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, looked at how stupid and callous Microsoft has been with its recent closures and figured, huh, we can buy a really cool studio on the cheap and get to own some really cool video games going forward if we just leave these guys alone to do their thing.</p><p>Something Microsoft could have also realised, but then, <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their line must always go up, no matter the cost</a>. Hopefully things go better for Tango now they're owned by quite literally anyone else. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/KRAFTON-Strengthens-Global-Presence-Through-Strategic-Integration-of-T">press release</a> sent out this evening, the publisher highlights Tango Gameworks' achievements through games such as <em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, and of course, 2023's darling <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p>
<p>The latter ended up being a break-out hit for the studio, and Krafton has secured the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> IP as apart of their strategic agreement. As such, the company will be collaborating with Microsoft to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks going forward. They've also expressed a desire to continue to develop the <em>Hi-Fi Rush IP</em> and explore future projects in that universe.</p>
<p>Whilst this marks a new era for Tango Gameworks, Krafton does stress that there will be no impact on their existing game catalogue - <em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>The Evil Within 2</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, and the original <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> will remain everywhere they currently are across all platforms.</p>
<p>Krafton also notes that their investment in Tango Gameworks will help them shore up and expand their global footprint and enhance their portfolio with high-quality content with this being their first significant move in the Japanese video game market.</p>

                <p>At long last, Ganondorf is getting the Figma figure treatment.

                <p>A sequel to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice doesn't seem likely, but at least you can make your own follow-up to the brilliant From Software action game with a pair of cute Nendoroid figures. Available to preorder now at Amazon, these two figures of Wolf ($46) and Genichiro Ashina ($52) will begin shipping out May 2025.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZRKJJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Wolf Nendoroid</a> -- $46 | May 14, 2025</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZDPYV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Genichiro Ashina Nendoroid</a> -- $52 | May 14, 2025</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346882-sekiro-nendoroids.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346882" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346882-sekiro-nendoroids.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346882"></a><figcaption>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Nendoroids</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346882-sekiro-nendoroids.jpg"></figure><p>The hero of Sekiro, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZRKJJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wolf has been given a cute makeover</a> for this semi-poseable collectible figure. He still has his signature scar, tattered clothing, and flowing scarf, and you can switch face-plates between a default expression and a more serious glaring one. For the optional parts, you're getting the katana Kusabimaru, a sheath for the weapon, and a "Death" effect sheet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZDPYV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genichiro's Nendoroid figure</a> is more regal, and comes equipped with flowing robes and ornate armor. He also comes with a katana, bow, and a dynamic display stand, so you can set up a pretty cool diaroma piece if you grab Wolf as well. He looks significantly less imposing as a Nendoroid figure, but if you make these two battle, you'll want to make sure you have Genichiro win the first few dozen battles for authenticity. </p><p>There are quite a few other Nendoroid figures available to preorder now, each one boasting a similar level of screen-accurate design and pocket-sized cuteness.

			<p>The popular Lossless Scaling software surprised everyone earlier in 2024 by <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> frame generation support with any graphics card in any PC game (with certain limitations).</p>
<p>The developer of Lossless Scaling continuously improved the frame generation component via a series of updates. FG 2.0 vastly reduced artifacts; FG 2.1 brought the performance boost from 2x to 3x; and now, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-4x-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a>, Lossless Scaling FG 2.3 quadruples the base frame rate. The latest version of the software was just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/4324104099036055973?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on Steam, and the changelog can be found below (it also adds initial support for NVIDIA G-Sync).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LSFG 2.3 introduces X4 frame generation mode, generating three intermediate frames. The recommended usage scenario starts with the game's base framerate of 60 frames and for monitors with a high refresh rate of 240 and above, but can also be used with lower framerates (where the base mode is expected to give better results compared to "performance").</em></li>
<li><em>X3 mode has been updated to further reduce artifacts on patterned textures and in dark scenes.</em></li>
<li><em>Increased UI detection rate from every 4th frame to 1 for "performance" mode, as it was found that this could cause some artifacts. This led to a slight decrease in performance, so this parameter can now be changed in the config.ini file located in the installation folder.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Initial support for G-Sync. It is recommended to enable it for full screen mode in the driver settings.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, the method will never be able to match a native implementation by AMD or NVIDIA. Still, it's a great way to boost performance in some older PC games upon need.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valorant-champs-2024-playoffs-bracket-locked-in.950529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champs-2024-playoffs-bracket/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Now that the group stage has wrapped up, the remaining eight teams in Seoul have advanced into the playoff round of this year’s Valorant Champions event. More than $2 million is still on the line, and out of those eight teams, <strong>one </strong>will walk away with a staggering prize worth $1 million.</p>



<p>Last year, Evil Geniuses scooped the number-one prize in Los Angeles, with Paper Rex falling into second place. Unfortunately, this won’t be a back-to-back win or a redemption event – EG failed to qualify for this year’s Valorant Champions and Paper Rex <strong>just </strong>got knocked out of the tournament by EDG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-champions-playoffs-schedule">Valorant Champions Playoffs Schedule</h2>



<p>Four monumental matches have been scheduled to open up the playoffs. It’s a double elimination bracket, which means every starting team will have the chance to lose twice before they’re removed from the tournament – once in the upper bracket and then again in the lower bracket.</p>



<p>Here are the opening fixtures for the Valorant Champs playoffs stage:</p>



<ul>
<li>DRX vs. Sentinels (August 14)</li>



<li>Trace Esports vs. EDward Gaming (August 14)</li>



<li>G2 Esports vs. Leviatán (August 15)</li>



<li>Team Heretics vs. Fnatic (August 15)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s anyone’s game, but presently, the frontrunners to win the number-one prize are DRX, closely followed by Sentinels. DRX is playing on home turf, and that advantage gave the squad a considerable boost in the group stage, with the team becoming one of the four to not lose a match. </p>



<p>Many are now backing the underdog side of Trace Esports, a Chinese organisation that pulled off a big win against Leviatán earlier this week to secure the team’s first-ever spot in the Valorant Champs playoffs round.</p>



<p>I’m backing Fnatic, the UK-based organisation that recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. It was just a few weeks ago that the team brought home a $100,000 prize during the EMEA Stage 2 tournament, and last year, the squad grabbed a second-place finish at Valorant Champs 2023 after <strong>winning </strong>VCT Masters Toyko. </p>

These games didn’t concern themselves with Italian plumbers or sad surrogate dads, but with fierce warriors who shirtlessly strode into battle, their muscles on glorious display, to cut down their foes with swords and prove themselves the strongest and manliest of all. I speak, of course, of barbarians. And though, in recent decades, games focused entirely on the heroic exploits of barbarians have been few and far between, we now find ourselves in the midst of a mini-renaissance of barbarian games!

            <p>The Borderlands movie adaptation generated just $4m across 3125 locations on its opening day.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/it-ends-with-us-opening-day-blake-lively-borderlands-bombing-1236102314/">Variety</a>, even with boosted ticket sales from Imax and "other premium large-format auditoriums", it seems its Hollywood cast isn't enough of a draw for the $115m production.</p>

<p>Variety points out that distributor Lionsgate has "financially shielded itself" and recouped 60 percent of its production costs through international pre-sales, but right now the film has the dubious honour of boasting the worst critical reviews of any movie released this summer.</p>
<p>The Borderlands movie was, of course, in the works for a long time. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced</a> back in 2015 before vanishing, and just as it looked like the project was dead and buried, Gearbox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hostel-director-eli-roth-is-helming-the-borderlands-movie">re-announced it</a> in February 2020, this time with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm.</p>
<p>Then, high-profile actors like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cate-blanchett-cast-in-eli-roths-borderlands-movie-adaptation">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, Gina Gershiwn, Kevin Hart, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a> all signed onto the project.</p>
<p>But then came the reviews and… well, as Matt summarised for us earlier in the week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">early impressions were not great</a>, with critics lamblasting the live-action film adaptation of Gearbox's looter-shooter as everything from a "huge misfire" to a "disaster".</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick has implored fans to give it a chance</a>, and Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822415283560005937">"blocked over a dozen accounts"</a> on X for being <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822410828102226241">"truly nasty"</a> about the movie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
