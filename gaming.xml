		<p>Last week, Nintendo did something unexpected by teasing a new game with no clues outside of a small trailer, calling it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/who-is-emio-nintendo-tease-new-switch-horror-game/">Emio</a>. Today, it has been confirmed that the teaser was for Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new Famicom Detective Club in 30 years. To mark the announcement, series producer Yoshio Sakamoto has spoken about the new project.</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A chat with producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpFWGeMLhjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story outline of Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club says,<em> “Junior high school student Eisuke Sasaki has been found dead in a chilling fashion, with a smiley-faced paper bag over his head.This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago – as well as the urban legend Emio, aka the Smiling Man, a serial killer said to grant his victims “a smile that will last forever”.Does the Smiling Man really exist…or is a new culprit continuing on his legacy? As a member of the Utsugi Detective Agency, you’ve been tasked with investigating the events that led to Eisuke Sasaki’s death. Along the way, scrutinise the clues and testimonies you gather for potential connections to the gruesome events of the past.”</em></p>
<p>In the game, players will have to collect clues and interview persons of interest to piece together the mystery of the Smiling Man, and solve the murder. In terms of Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club release, it seems that a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-119249/">physical edition</a> is being made available in the US, but not in Europe. The game has been priced at $49.99, and will be available from 29th August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/why-remaster-one-of-gamings-most-impressive-misfires-the-thing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Towards the end of <em>Waypoint</em>, we started and (eventually) finished an ambitious 101 project, where everyone on staff (plus joyous gamer and Immortality producer Natalie Watson) proposed a different video game for us all to play, dissect, and understand over the next year.</p><p>My pick was 2002’s <em>The Thing.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>I’d never played this survival horror take on John Carpenter’s masterpiece, but I'd heard a lot about it. It's known almost as much for what it <em>doesn’t </em>accomplish as much as what it <em>does</em>. It’s an ambitious work, and I call it a misfire not out of dismissal, as <em>The Thing i</em>s very much deserving of respect. As I outlined in an essay from 2022 on the experience: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgyqv4/the-video-game-version-of-the-thing-is-an-empty-promise-worth-playing?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The Thing is an empty promise worth playing.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><em>The Thing </em>attempted to turn the delicious premise of Carpenter’s film, in which an alien is able to successfully hide amongst a crew of Antarctic researchers, into a video game. A game that chose an easier path towards success would’ve made the experience entirely scripted, where every surprise was, like the movie, pre-planned. But the game wants far more, introducing all sorts of half-broken systemic elements where, in theory, a friend can become an enemy—a thing—at any time. Sometimes, it works. Oftentimes, it doesn’t. Every time, it’s really cool.</p><p>Here’s what I said in that 2022 piece:</p><blockquote>“Revisiting older games without baked-in nostalgia is already a difficult proposition, because without the fuzzy positive memories, it’s extremely difficult to situate yourself in the context the game was released in and fully appreciate what it was trying to do at that point in history. Playing games from the past requires a deft hand, because so much of video game design is specifically iterating on the past, often making it hard to fully appreciate what came before.&nbsp;<p><em>The Thing </em>had some radically cool and inventive ideas, even if didn’t know what to do with them. Perhaps the coolest takeaway from having played it is realizing that, even today, not many games are trying to do what <em>The Thing</em> attempted. It’s still exciting.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s a game that deserved a sequel, and for a minute, <a href="https://thething.fandom.com/wiki/The_Thing_II_(video_game)?ref=remapradio.com"><u>they were developing one.</u></a> While The Thing 2 never happened, we’re getting a wonderful consolation prize, as Nightdive Studios, the gold standard for remasters, is turning its attention towards<em> The Thing</em>. Hell <em>yes</em>.</p><p>I recently had an opportunity to ask some of the folks working on <em>The Thing </em>remaster at Nightdive, as I was especially curious whether they’ll try and touch up some of the elements of the game that were clearly supposed to work differently than how they function in the game.</p><p>What follows is a short chat with Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive, and Joel Welsh, art lead at Nightdive who’s worked on the recent <em>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em> remaster, alongside <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, <em>System Shock 2</em>, <em>Killing Time</em>, and others.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>I highly recommend checking out Nightdive’s YouTube channel</u></a>, as they’re doing some fantastic ongoing dives into their work <em>and</em> the original works.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Nightdive's remaster will include a new and more impressive lighting system. This screen shot feels a tad dark, though?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: I suspect Nightdive is used to working on games with missing source code, broken code, messed up assets, etc. What state was/is <em>The Thing</em> in, when you decided to move forward with the project, and how did it compare to some of Nightdive’s other projects?</strong></p><p>Larry Kuperman: We had two major advantages for this project. We began with a repository of the source code, a huge advantage. And then we were fortunate enough to have run into two of the members of the Computer Artworks team, the original developers of the 2002 version. That gave us access to a tremendous amount of assets, most in high-resolution format.</p><p>Joel Welsh: I’ll echo what Larry said. Compared to games like <em>Turok 3</em>, we were extremely fortunate in this case, not to mention we had about a year of prep time.</p><p><strong>When I replayed <em>The Thing</em> a few years back, I wrote an essay about the experience that described the game as “an empty promise worth playing.” I meant that in the most complimentary way possible, because it’s such a uniquely flawed experience. Did you play the game when it was originally released? If so, what did you make of it at the time?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Joel: I played it at release. Looking back, that was over 20 years ago… One memory that comes to mind is the Rupture boss in the underground crate room right before you enter the submersible. It’s kind of a mixed bag, but I really enjoyed it, flaws and all. Working on the remaster has been a dream come true.</p><p><strong>Building on the same point, a huge part of what doesn’t work in The Thing feels like a team that ran out of time. The answers are in the game, but it just doesn’t function exactly the way it’s supposed to. See: the enemy AI, thing transformations. How do you balance trying to go in and “fix” some of these elements, while training to maintain what made the game eccentric and interesting in the first place?</strong></p><p>Joel: Assuming you mean the blood test, we’re working to resolve it, along with some of the other so-called faults of the original. By all accounts, Computer Artworks created the game they set out to make.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_P6fwckB5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Thing: Remastered Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios"></iframe></figure><p><strong>How much of this project is a collaboration with the original developers? And how often is that an aim for Nightdive projects?</strong></p><p>Joel: In this case, we’re working closely with Ron Ashtiani and Mark Atkinson. Stephen and Larry made that happen. I knew Ron prior to joining Nightdive and his insight on art direction has been invaluable.&nbsp;</p><p>As an aside, his work on <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>was quite good. On the other hand, Mark wrote the code for his first game at 11, graduated from University at 16, and built the framework for The Thing, along with several other systems for Computer Artworks almost single-handedly. The man is a genius. Nothing gets past their scrutiny, and we’re really enjoying the collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>To your second point, it’s important that we reach out to members of the original team whenever possible. For instance, we collaborated with Nelson Everhart for the remastered soundtrack of <em>Turok 3</em>, and Mike Lavine and Justin Chin helped with <em>Star Wars</em>. As Larry puts it, “We don’t know better than the original developers.” Words of wisdom.</p><p><strong>The Thing was a very hard game, partially because it was hard to parse and partially because it felt a little broken. What’s the fine line between trying to maintain that sense of danger and strangeness, versus ensuring a modern audience has a good time with it?</strong></p><p>Larry: We’re currently investigating ways to address difficulty and make other quality-of-life improvements. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p><p><strong>Is the concept of a “remaster” becoming blurrier for you? Remaster, remake, reimagining. At one point, it felt like a “remaster” was merely getting a game to run on a modern platform. These days, there’s more and more work going in to tweaking and updating these games.</strong></p><p>Joel: I dare say the opposite; the concept of what a Nightdive remaster should be is becoming clearer with every release. Stephen Kick has a vision for the company—bringing lost and forgotten gaming treasures back from the depths. I would compare Nightdive titles to Special Edition DVDs of yesteryears—higher quality presentation with extra features and bonus content. Merely getting a game to run on modern platforms with original assets, as you put it, is more of a port. We still do those—<em>PO’ed</em> is a recent example. It varies case-by-case, and what our partners expect when entrusting us with their IPs. For <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>, Universal has been incredibly supportive.</p>

The sparse fifteen seconds of footage showed a creepy man in a trenchcoat, wearing a paper bag over his head, scrawled with a smiling face. The vibe of the trailer immediately screamed horror, as did the unexpected age-restriction to watch it. Initially, fans theorized this would be horror developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040">Bloober Team</a></span>’s mysterious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project M</a></span>, but now that seems not to be the case. </p><p>For those not familiar with the <em>Famicom Detective Club </em>series, I can’t blame you. The original games, <em>The Missing Heir</em> and <em>The Girl Who Stands Behind,</em> were released in 1988 and 1989 respectively, and only in Japan. The series blends visual novel and adventure game mechanics in its stories of mystery and murder, and while they have a cult status, neither game was easily playable on modern hardware—until Nintendo released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/these-famicom-detective-club-games-have-aged-surprising-1846898388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/these-famicom-detective-club-games-have-aged-surprising-1846898388">remakes</a></span> of both for the Nintendo Switch in 2021, and released them worldwide for the first time. I suppose that should have been a sign the franchise could make a comeback. </p><p>Considering the cult status of the series, the first teaser for the game was a smart marketing move. Nintendo spent a week getting people curious about what <em>Emio</em> was, and now there are more eyes on the game than if the first trailer outright said this was a new <em>Famicom Detective Club</em> entry. Fans of the franchise are expressing their excitement in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1813560122549137533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1813560122549137533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal post</a></span> on Nintendo’s X (formerly Twitter), but there are also those disappointed that <em>Emio</em> isn’t the more modern horror title they built up in their heads. If you want to get a taste of what <em>Emio – The Smiling Man</em> will be like, you can pick up the remake duology for $60 on Switch.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EVO 2024 kicks off on Friday, with tens of thousands of fans flocking to Las Vegas to take in the sights and watch pro FGC players beat the daylights out of one another – digitally, of course. This is arguably the most important event in the FGC calendar, and this year’s super-sized spectacle is shaping up to be one of the biggest esports events ever.</p>



<p>It has already won that title according to the player count – more than 15,000 competitors are expected to turn up to take part, which decimates even the Esports World Cup, which is playing host to 21 games.</p>

<h2 id="h-evo-2024-line-up">EVO 2024 Line-up</h2>

There’s also a stacked community showcase made up of smaller – but still highly entertaining – fighting games.</p>



<p>This list is enormous and includes the likes of Dragon Ball FighterZ, Killer Instinct, Soulcalibur VI, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, and Vampire Savior.</p>



<p>With seven official channels broadcasting the action over the weekend, several huge sponsors backing the event, and hundreds of thousands of fans either tuning in online or heading to Las Vegas to watch it in person, EVO 2024 is one of the most ambitious esports events of the year.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/bandai-namco-unveils-exciting-hands-lineup-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Bandai Namco Europe revealed the anticipated lineup of titles it will bring to Gamescom 2024.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s games will include Little Nightmares 3, Unknown 9 Awakening, and Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. </p>



<p>The event will feature “world premiere hands-on demos,” and Sparking Zero will be playable for the first time. Bandai Namco will be located at Hall 6, booth A20 for Gamescom 2024.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bandai Namco continues to generate buzz around Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero with consistent reveals. It announced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bandai-namco-reveals-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-roster-and-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roster and features</a> last March, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-game-modes-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gameplay modes</a> in June. </p>



<p>Key characters include Master Roshi and Nappa, while the game modes feature Episode Battles, Custom Battles, and local multiplayer. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero launches <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on October 11, 2024</a>, for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>



<p>Although there’s also hype for Little Nightmares 3, the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed its launch</a> until 2025. Its style is consistent with previous games, with moody suspense and striking imagery.</p>



<p>Unknown 9: Awakening is a story-driven adventure from Reflector Entertainment, where players can use abilities from a parallel dimension.</p>



<p>Gamescom 2024 will run from August 21 to August 25, and it returns to Cologne, Germany this year. </p>



<p>Although it is one of the largest gaming events, Sony recently confirmed it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-skip-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skip Gamescom again</a> for the fifth time in a row. Last April, Nintendo also announced it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-isnt-going-to-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not attend the event</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new entry in the series in over 30 years, and it will launch for Nintendo Switch on August 29. Last week, Nintendo hinted at the game by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-the-scariest-game-teaser-of-the-year/1100-6524826/" data-ref-id="1100-6524826">dropping a spooky teaser.</a></p><p>Once again, the player works as an assistant private investigator with the Utsugi Detective Agency, and must solve the mystery behind the death of a student whose head was covered by a paper bag with a smiling face drawn on it. Eighteen years ago, there were similar incidents with the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man, a killer of urban legend who did the same. Along with returning series protagonist Ayumi Tachibana, the duo will work together to figure out if Emio has returned, or if it's just a copycat crime.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club | Producer Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In 2021, Nintendo released remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club games: The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, which were released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Series producer Yoshio Sakamoto is returning to handle the brand-new game.</p><p>"Both games were designed with the image in mind of a mystery movie that you progress through and solve," he explained in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHBtMQaj7w0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction video</a>. "While we were working on the remakes of those games for Nintendo Switch in 2021, I thought that we definitely need to continue this series with a brand-new game."</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/famicom-detective-club-review-the-n-e-s-murders/1900-6417680/" data-ref-id="1900-6417680">Famicom Detective Club review</a>, we said, "The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, while mechanically similar, offer pretty different takes on the detective game. Do you want to slowly unravel the conspiracy behind a powerful woman's death in a quiet village? Or, would you rather chase down a murderer in a high-octane, spooky thrill ride? The former is better executed, but both are worthwhile opportunities to dust off your magnifying glass."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I update, introducing "a complete refresh of the universe", increased flora and fauna diversity, and big visual enhancements, plus lots more.</p>
<p>Visual changes include new water effects with "realistic wave formations and foam generation", as well as deeper and more detailed shadows, better definition for clouds, and more. Suffice it to say that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>should now be significantly more beautiful places to visit.</p>
<p>The changes aren't just visual, though; several of the game's planets have also been dramatically transformed with new floating islands that could serve as perfect places for "bases in the sky", as Hello Games puts it. You can't tell me you've never wanted to live amongst the clouds!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=WR5R0efT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=jPNsg0br 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update promises a significant visual overhaul for the almost eight-year-old game.</figcaption></figure><p>Those worlds will also be populated by new creatures, "bizarre floral hybrids" that boast "stamen-like whiskers and petal-like faces". Just in case you weren't quite unsettled enough by what's already out there in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes, including improved wind simulation, more diverse desert worlds, and even frozen sub-zero planets with icy trees and glacial rocks, have also been implemented, hopefully bringing&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s galaxy to life like never before.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I, which shows off some of the game's new visual changes in motion, right here.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hello Games head Sean Murray has also released a deep dive video detailing some of Worlds Part I's changes in close-up, so if you're interested in the technical side of things, you can check that video out here.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not just visual and world changes; Worlds Part I also has new content for you to discover, including a new insect-themed armor set, new UI label elements, and much more. You can check out the full&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-i-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Worlds Part I is just the latest update in Hello Games' ongoing redemption story, with previous updates bringing features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update">starship customization</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-omega-update">expeditions</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-echoes-update">additional story elements</a> to make&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>a more enticing prospect.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>since its launch, it's a very different beast today, especially with Worlds Part I's visual update. You can grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/216600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Crocs has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to offer more official versions of its shoes.
</p>
<p>
Following the Pikachu-themed Classic Clog released earlier this year, four more variants are due to arrive this year based on Gen 1 favourites Gengar, Charizard, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff.
</p>
<p>
Each design features a Jibbitz charm to go with its colour scheme, as well as Pokéball logos on the straps. I hate them all.

"This new pack promises to captivate fans of both brands, merging the playful essence of Pokémon with the comfort and style of Crocs," reads the post. "Style" seems like a stretch.

Perhaps these garish, jellified shoes are your thing, but I can't think of anything worse to put on my feet, let alone wear them in public. Pokémon Crocs, I choose... none of you.

<p>
Still, Pokémon merchandise always seems to sell well, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">exclusive card at the Van Gogh Museum caused quite the furore</a>.

Murray describes it as “S<em>tarship Troopers</em> inspired” and says players’ fight against these bugs across the new planets they explore will be “community driven” and come with a new heavy armor mech that has a flame thrower for an arm.

Some hoped for custom space stations, others guessed a complete universal reset, and a few wondered if Hello Games might finally be ready to share more information about it’s other upcoming project, the fantasy survival RPG <em>Light No Fire</em>. We didn’t end up getting a new trailer for that game, but it did come up in today’s update. </p><p>“Six months ago we announced<em> Light No Fire</em>,” Murray wrote. “It’s this insanely ambitious game. Over the last five years making game, we’ve learnt new things, and we’re feeding that back into <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. It feels like we’re bringing technology back from the future!” That’s effectively another way of saying that the new planetary features players can now experience in No Man’s Sky also act as a teaser, and potentially an early preview, of what they can expect from the look and feel of<em> Light No Fire</em>. The game doesn’t have a release date but here’s hoping we hear more about it at one of the gaming showcases coming later this year.</p><p> For now, here’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full list of every change in the 5.0 patch notes</a></span>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h3 id="h1563"><a id=""></a><strong>SKY AND CLOUD RENDERING</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The atmospheric and volumetric cloud rendering system has been completely rewritten for vastly increased detail and definition.</li><li>Planets now exhibit a greater range of cloud coverage: over time; from planet-to-planet; and in response to weather conditions.</li><li>Planets with rain will no longer use the ambient rain effect when cloud coverage is insufficient.</li><li>Daytime sky colours are now significantly more varied.</li><li>Night-time ambient lighting is no longer always blue, and can vary according to the planet’s natural environment.</li><li>Night-time darkness levels now vary as the night progresses.</li><li>Night-time darkness now varies from planet-to-planet, with some being significantly darker than others.</li></ul><h3 id="h1564"><a id=""></a><strong>WATER RENDERING</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Water rendering has been completely overhauled, and now uses a mesh-based system that allows for true wave and foam generation.</li><li>Water conditions vary over time in response to both local weather and the depth of the water at any particular location, producing effects from stormy seas and huge ocean swells to tranquil still ponds.</li><li>Water now reflects the sun and features ambient planetary reflections for dramatically increased visual quality.</li><li>Water colour variety has been significantly increased.</li><li>Base parts with glass now accurately render the water conditions outside.</li><li>Sealed underwater base parts will no longer “leak” water into the base.</li><li>Ships now leave splashes and trails in the water when flying low.</li><li>Underwater jetpack effects have been significantly improved.</li><li>Swimming effects have been significantly improved.</li><li>Starships can now be fitted with aquatic landing jets, allowing them to land or be summoned just above the surface of the ocean.</li><li>A biological equivalent of this technology has been added for living ships.</li></ul><h3 id="h1565"><a id=""></a><strong>GENERAL ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li><li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li><li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li><li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate and saves significant amounts of memory.</li><li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li><li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li><li>Significant memory and performance optimisations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation and procedural mesh generation.</li></ul><h3 id="h1566"><a id=""></a><strong>DLSS3</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to</li><li>PC players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.</li><li>Support for the latest iteration, DLSS3, has been added to No Man’s Sky.</li><li>DLSS3 multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHfNDBIQ1kk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> today, Hello Games finally announced the Worlds Part 1 update coming to No Man’s Sky, following a series of cryptic teases on X.</p>



<p>Sean Murray of Hello Games led a deep dive trailer for the update, confirming all of the key changes players can expect. </p>



<p>Worlds Part 1, Update 5.0, will introduce improved visuals, more planetary diversity, and a variety of new features. </p>



<p>That includes the fourteenth community expedition, where Liquidators must hunt down bugs spreading across the universe. Liquidators will also be armed with a combat mech, and corresponding insect armor. For some, it partly resembles Helldivers 2, which did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell 12 million units</a> in weeks.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Man's Sky - Worlds Part 1 Deep Dive | PS5, PS4, PS VR2, PSVR Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHfNDBIQ1kk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Hello Games also released <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy patch notes</a> on No Man’s Sky anticipated Worlds update. In Worlds Part 1, players can finally rename discoveries at any time, “even after upload.” </p>



<p>Planets throughout the game universe are also transformed due to gravitational distortions. As a result, players will find floating islands and can build bases in the sky. </p>



<p>Fans can also craft Solar-class starships, find unusual new creatures, and enjoy new interaction labels.</p>



<p>Between living, walking planetary buildings and a host of engine improvements, Worlds Part 1 is one of the game’s most ambitious updates yet. It has DLSS3 support, fresh biomes, and extensive quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>No Man’s Sky is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox. Fans still await <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hello-games-light-no-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light No Fire</a>, which Hello Games announced at The Game Awards 2023.</p>

Featuring huge leaps in water and cloud visuals, increased planetary diversity, new gameplay features, and more.</p><ul><li><strong>Big Hunt Expedition: The Liquidators</strong> – Engage in a galactic bug hunt in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s fourteenth community expedition. A vile brood is spreading corruption across the universe—join the Liquidator Vanguard to do your part and purge the rot from the stars! Report for duty alongside other Travellers to liquidate biological <a title="Genres > Horror [439 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s and hosts of giant insects in a high-paced combat expedition full of custom-balanced swarm combat.

Gravitational distortions have warped some lush and tropical worlds, shaking loose floating islands that now drift in the atmosphere above the planet’s surface. Hop from rock-to-rock with the jetpack or starship, build bases in the sky, or simply marvel at the dramatic waterfalls that cascade down from the sky.</li><li><strong>New Volumetric Clouds</strong> – A total overhaul of the clouds brings vastly increased detail and definition. The cloud system has been rewritten from the ground up to improve performance, fix visual artefacts, and introduce fine details such as wispy cirrus clouds and dark, rain-laden nimbus clouds. In addition, cloud coverage variety has been boosted, varying significantly from planet-to-planet, as well as over time and in response to local weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Customize Solar Ships</strong> – The Starship Fabricator now supports the <a title="Genres > Crafting [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> of Solar-class starships.

Additionally, shadows cast by clouds are now calculated in relation to the sun position.</li><li><strong>High Definition Water</strong> – An astounding range of sights await explorers on water planets, as seas, oceans, and lakes now ripple and sparkle with realistic wave formations and foam generation. As well as these living, dynamic water conditions, a total overhaul of the water rendering technology also brings dramatic reflections and beautifully lit surface details.</li><li><strong>Otherworldly Life</strong> – Discover strange new creatures all across the universe.

Leaves and grass rustle in gentle wind while whole trees rock and sway during storms. Smoke effects, billowing dust clouds, rain, snow and other environmental effects all go through the same wind system, for an immersive and consistent exploration experience.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Water</strong> – Bodies of water respond to the weather—ranging from glassy lakes to turbulent oceans, depending on the stillness of the breeze and the depth of the water. Violent storms can generate dramatically choppy seas and huge ocean swells.</li><li><strong>Liquidator Combat Mech</strong> – Carve through the toughest enemies in a new heavy duty mech suit. All those who do their part in the Liquidators expedition will unlock these new combat-focused components for the Minotaur. As the community purge the vile brood from the universe, plans for these parts will become available at the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion for those unable to take part in the expedition.</li><li><strong>Sub-Zero Worlds</strong> – Frozen worlds have been transformed with ice-laden trees and glittering glacial rocks.

Rendering of environmental objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been moved to a GPU-based system, allowing for denser worlds with increased performance. Planetary flora, minerals and curiosities have improved levels of detail from further distances and a broader range of angles. Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, increasing loading speed, improving framerate and saving memory.</li><li><strong>New Interaction Labels</strong> – Labels for interactive and destructible objects in the universe have been restyled and made more responsive, providing critical information without obscuring the view.</li><li><strong>Beetle Diversity</strong> – A wide variety of new insect-like creatures can now be discovered scuttling across the universe.

Study their natural patterns, harvest their nourishing slime, or adopt them as companions.</li><li><strong>Dramatic Storms</strong> – Exploring a planet during a blizzard or thunderstorm is more exhilarating than ever. New ambient effects and atmospheric fog combine with wind-responsive particle effects to create dramatic storms that sweep across the planet’s surface.</li><li><strong>Twitch Drops</strong> – Watch experienced Travellers stream <em>No Man’s Sky</em> on Twitch, and earn rewards!

                <p>A two-year-old is dead after her father left her in a car in 100-degree heat as he was "distracted by playing video games," according to court documents obtained by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/16/arizona-hot-car-death-christopher-scholtes/74431098007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. Christopher Scholtes, 37, of Arizona, left his daughter in the car as he went inside to put groceries away and play video games.</p><p>Scholtes said his daughter was sleeping when they got back from running errands, and he didn't want to wake her, so he left her in the car with the air conditioning running. He told police he "wanted her to remain in the vehicle while she slept," but the air conditioning switched off after 30 minutes, the documents say. Police are now saying the child was left in the vehicle for about three hours at the home in Marana, Arizona.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2YPsrcmkZQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u2YPsrcmkZQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Scholtes did not realize he forgot about his daughter until after his wife Erika came back from work a few hours later, the documents state. Together, they found their daughter unresponsive in the car. They attempted life-saving measures before she was transported to a local hospital where she died.</p><p>While the toddler was on the way to the hospital, Scholtes is said to have texted Erika, saying, "Babe I'm sorry! ... Babe our family. How could I do this. I killed our baby, this can't be real."</p><p>Police seized a PlayStation 5 and other electronics as part of the investigation, while Scholtes' vehicle was also taken by authorities. Authorities are now examining the PS5 and Scholtes' laptop to attempt to determine what Scholtes was doing while his child was left in the vehicle.</p><p>Scholtes is facing charges for second-degree murder and child abuse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developers of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166275/no-mans-sky-adrift-update"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a> have announced their next update, which is dubbed Worlds Part&nbsp;I. According to Hello Games founder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11152396/no-mans-sky-preview-sean-murray-interview-ps4-pc">Sean Murray</a>, this update will be one of the game’s prettiest yet, literally changing the way players see the universe. “In <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, what you see on screen is generated by the computer,” Murray wrote. “The level of variety we are achieving is far beyond what was possible before.”</p><p>The update is largely graphical, adding a host of new weather and terrain features designed to make planets feel even more real. Water will produce waves and reflections, waves will now respond to different weather phenomena, and the game will finally let ships land directly on the water. Worlds Part I will add new atmospheric conditions as well. Lava flows will belch sparks into the air while fog, blizzards, rain, and clouds make the procedurally generated locations feel more like living planets.</p><p>According to Murray, creating realistic clouds presented a unique challenge to the team. With the Worlds Part I update, new cloud technology — no, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187164/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-app-fire-tv-stick-amazon-launch">not that kind</a> — will introduce even more variety to planets. He also shared that the update will have a <em>Starship Troopers</em> vibe featuring a new mech players are going to need to fight off enemies.</p><p>Murray wrote about how new technology and work on Hello Games’ next project, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990841/hello-games-light-no-fire-trailer"><em>Light No Fire</em></a><em>,</em> has allowed the team to go back and work on <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. “Over the last five years making the game, we’ve learnt new things, and we’re feeding that back into No Man’s Sky,” Murray said. </p><p>The update is available today, but with a name like World’s Part I, you can naturally be sure that a part two won’t be far behind.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's mysterious horror game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">glimpsed last week via a brief and bizarre teaser trailer</a> - is in fact a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series. 
</p>
<p>
Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will launch on 29th August, Nintendo confirmed today, showing off a first look at the game's artwork, featuring its creepy paper bag-headed villain.
</p>
<p>
If you're unfamiliar with the retro adventure series, this is a Nintendo-developed franchise originally released in the late 1980s. Two games were released, but only in Japan. And there they remained for more than 30 years, until a Nintendo Switch remake of the pair launched worldwide in 2021.

<p>
Nintendo veteran designer Yoshio Sakamoto, of Metroid fame, is returning to the series for Emio - The Smiling Man, Nintendo confirmed today. </p>
<p>
In a brief developer interview, Sakamoto said the game's creepy villain will pop up in-game after previously being thought of as an urban legend. It's up to you to investigate a murder and discover the truth behind the paper bag-wearing myth.
</p><p>

More concrete detail on the game from a Nintendo press release reveals that you will play the role of a junior private investigator aiding local police with a murder case. A student has been found dead, his head covered with a paper bag bearing the same smiling face as the legendary Smiling Man, who was also linked to other murders in the past. 
 
"Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man story, or the origin of it? Players will discover the answers and more as they investigate in Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club," Nintendo writes.

			<p>Nintendo has announced Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club - the first new game in the series in 35 years.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq_NGMM2FWE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo uploaded a teaser</a> for what looked like to be some kind of horror title. Some suggested that this teaser was related to a new game from Bloober Team, but as it turned out, this wasn't the case. Fast forward one week and Nintendo has now officially revealed a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series - Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club. We've included the official announcement trailer below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A Chat with Producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHBtMQaj7w0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>A student has been found dead! His head was covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it—much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man—a killer of urban legend who is said to place such a bag over his victims’ heads.</em></p>
<p><em>As an assistant private investigator, you are tasked with helping police solve this crime, which is reminiscent of a series of unsolved murders from 18 years ago. Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man story, or the origin of it?</em></p>
<p><em>Discover the answers to these questions and more as a member of the Utsugi Detective Agency in this intense story of suspicion, isolation, and fragility.</em></p>
<p>In the game, players take on the role of an assistant private investigator with Utsugi Detective Agency. Players are tasked with helping police solve a crime. Along the way, scrutinize the clues and testimonies you gather for potential connections to the gruesome events of the past.</p>
<p>Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club launches for the Nintendo Switch next month on August 29. As said, this is the first new entry in the series in 35 years - the most recent game (The Girl Who Stands Behind) was released in 1989.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-august-release-date-for-mysterious-emio-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1813560024750321730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Nintendo officially announced that Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club has a release date for August 29, 2024.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement included a very brief trailer, which again featured the titular Emio. However, the grainy footage transitions from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous teaser</a> into the art style fans might expect to see in-game.</p>



<p>It also confirms that Emio is part of the Famicom Detective Club IP. This classic Nintendo IP originally released in the late 80’s with two memorable games. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Currently, fans can play Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection, which released in 2021. The collection includes both The Girl Who Stands Behind and The Missing Heir. Both titles currently have strong user ratings on Metacritic, respectively 8.1 and 7.9.</p>



<p>Emio was just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/emio-has-been-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Australia</a> last week, signaling that the release date was coming soon. The existing trailer gained an enormous amount of interest from Nintendo fans due to its horror atmosphere and M Rating by the ESRB.</p>



<p>The Nintendo brand is often family-friendly, but its connection to Famicom Detective Club reveals the tone players should expect.</p>



<p>Nintendo recently held <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/">a massive direct</a> showcase that lasted about 40 minutes. It revealed many games coming in 2024, though Emio was not among them. Some highlights included Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s get the obvious out of the way: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate is an awful lot like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>. Instead of venturing through the Greek underworld as a demigod, you’re fighting through New York City as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. TMNT: Splintered Fate is a roguelike action RPG where each run is a little bit different, partly thanks to having four playable characters instead of one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIaR93sOHRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>TMNT: Splintered Fate’s story begins with Leonardo training, only to be ambushed the Foot Clan and Shredder, who breaks the news that Splinter has been kidnapped. This starts a chain of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles facing off against the Foot Clan, as well as some other groups that have it out for the Turtles.</p>


<p>As a roguelike, progress is made through repetition. At the start of a run you can choose which of the four turtles you want to play as, with each having their own unique specials and skills. Michelango has the largest attack area size and has the most chance to deal multi-damage. His tool is taunting, which damages enemies and briefly stuns them when they are hit. Leonardo has a master strike that hits at the end of a combo, and his base tool is throwing three shuriken. Raphael has increased chances to deal critical hits, and his tools are a turtle line that pulls enemies towards him while dealing damage. Finally, Donatello has a shield blast that deals damage and briefly makes him immune to damage. His tools also charge 80% faster than the others, and at the start of each level he regains some health.</p>
<p>While all of them have these unique abilities and own weapons, the basic combat remains the same for all. That is getting in close and dealing damage to multi enemies in various ways. Even so, my personal preference was Donatello purely because of the health advantage, and being able to use tools faster than others.</p>


<p>Of course, picking your Turtle of choice is just the first step. Every run is different due to the random nature of the bonuses you can acquire. You may get bonuses that deal flame or water damage, and others that allow you to move faster. Some of the elements, which are flame, water, electricity, ooze, astral light, and astral dark, can be combined together to improve the damage you deal. However, there are also times when one selection can replace another bonus. This could be a good or bad thing. For example, I had an unstable ooze container tool that dealt decent area damage, and accidentally replaced it with a shuriken storm, which dealt less overall damage. If you get lucky, you will have higher powered versions of these abilities appear at the end of each level, which can lead to attacks becoming more powerful.</p>
<p>Like any roguelike, you lose all of your acquired abilities at the end of a run, but can unlock permanent upgrades through the Dragon and Dreamer bonuses. These unlock after a few levels, once you hit that skill brick wall where you cannot advance without permanent buffs. Dragon bonuses focus on direct effects, like increasing attack power, health, and improved rates for critical attacks. Dreamer bonuses impact the intangible aspects of the game, increasing chances of various drops and items appearing during a run. To unlock these you have to collect Dragon and Dreamer coins, which can then be spent back at base.</p>
<p>On top of these, there are artifacts which are unlocked for completing specific events and tasks in a run, like beating specific bosses. You can change which artifact you want to equip between attempts. Some artifacts increase the likelihood of specific element ability options appearing for you to select while others increase odds of dodging an attack.</p>

<p>There are four stages within TMNT: Splintered Fate, with these being The Sewers, The Docks, The Streets, and The Rooftops. These areas follow the same pattern with rooms of enemies to power through, with a miniboss battle taking place halfway through, and a boss battle at the end of the stage. What TMNT: Splintered Fate does well is mix up the mid boss and boss level fights. The mid bosses switch between each run, and a couple of the bosses grow stronger following the end of a successful run. Completing your first successful run is satisfying but it also really marks the true start of the game.</p>
<p>At the end of this run optional Dreamer and Gauntlet challenges are added to the game. Dreamer portals grant boons but can require some sacrifice to obtain those bonuses. Gauntlet challenges are the true tests of TMNT: Splintered Fate. These challenges are available for midboss and end boss fights for every stage, making bosses stronger and introducing additional strong enemies. For example, in one boss fight, the boss gains more powerful elemental abilities while also being accompanied by elite enemies that are essentially mini bosses themselves.</p>
<p>One of the issues with TMNT: Splintered Fate is that while it is entertaining, it starts to feel repetitive and the story is really not that gripping. The voice actors do a very good job, but the story feels elongated to pad the game out. After my fourth successful run, April exclaimed we were likely halfway through the process to rescue Splinter. It is supposed to come across as encouraging, but instead I asked out loud if the game was serious. There is only so many times you can go through the same four stages and bosses, even if they have tweaks each time, before wanting to stop.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Entertainment System is a true industry icon, but has a somewhat more diminished role in the memories of many British gamers. Unlike in the US and Japan where it reigned supreme, the NES was less ubiquitous over here, and I personally found myself more immersed in the Amiga and Atari wars, before Mario-mania took over with the Super Nintendo. I did have a mate with a NES and so had some time with the little grey box, but not enough for it to be deeply embedded in my childhood memories. However, Nintendo’s focus on legacy franchises and rereleasing its most famous titles has resulted in a kind of second hand nostalgia.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wW3rNlfRgyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Inspired by the occasional real world championships, Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition brings a competitive tilt to retro NES gaming on the Switch as you are challenged to take on bite-sized sections of the console’s most famous titles and complete them in the fastest possible time. With a sizeable line-up of games and dozens of individual missions across each, this is a veritable playable museum of Nintendo’s first console.</p>


<p>Booting up Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition brings you to a menu offering solo and local multiplayer modes. The former contains three main game modes – Speedrun, World Championships, and Survival. The latter two here require a Nintendo Switch Online membership, and with servers only opening at the start of the week, the bulk of my time with the game has therefore been spent on the Speedrun mode. There are 169 micro challenges here to challenge and master, serving as training for the online sections as well as being compulsive in their own right. These challenges are spread across 13 games but not equally as some have over 20, whilst poor Ice Climbers and Excite Bike only have 6 each.</p>
<p>The lineup includes most of the system’s iconic titles, but the lack of games by Capcom and Konami is a missed opportunity. Instead we have Nintendo’s first party range fully represented with four Marios, both Zeldas, Metroid, Kirby, Kid Icarus, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight and the aforementioned Ice Climbers and Excite Bike. Throughout each set of challenges, you’ll be taking on timed boss fights, tricky platforming sections or even micro tasks befitting a WarioWare game, like collecting the first mushroom in Super Mario Bros in the quickest time possible. The thrill and addictiveness comes from refining your technique to shave off milliseconds each time and aim for the coveted S ranking.</p>


<p>After unlocking all of an individual game’s challenges, your final obstacle will be a more lengthy and involved Legend level. These vary depending on each game but include completing the whole first Mario game using the level skips and completing the first dungeon of Zelda. For anyone outside the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Games Done Quick</a> crew, the Legend challenges include a useful Classified Information page that looks like a guide straight out of an Official Nintendo Magazine. To further encourage replayability (if beating your own time was not enough) every task is ranked and an in-game pin is awarded if you get an A rank or higher. As I write this review I’ve successfully finished all the main challenges and am working on the Legend ones.</p>
<p>One aspect of the game I found a little unnecessary was the coin system. Finishing a challenge opens up the opportunity to purchase the next one for 100 coins (300 for the Legend ones), but while coins are plentiful to begin with there aren’t enough to unlock everything, even if you succeed each time, meaning some grinding is needed. With a handful of levels taking less than two seconds to complete, this grinding isn’t hugely time consuming but it takes away from the feeling of progress.</p>

<p>Online modes are where you’ll be testing your skills against players around the world. First up in Survival you’ll be taking on ghost data uploaded by other players in a series of three challenges randomly picked from the full range. The first round sees eight players whittled down to four and then a final head-to-head for victory. These are fun and there are silver and gold divisions to offer varying levels challenge. If nothing else, seeing how the very best scores are obtained is useful training for your own skills even in defeat. That being said, the default view has eight individual screens showing all your competitors and that is very difficult to focus on when playing on handheld.</p>
<p>World Championship mode contains 5 missions and you can continuously repeat these with only your best time being recorded. New Championships take place every week but there is no indication of how well you are doing until the results come in. This means that there is a nagging compulsion to go back and try and get the time down a little bit more, but doesn’t have the same effect as a traditional high score table.</p>
<p>The other nagging feeling, though, is that it’s a bit rich to demand a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play these modes. There’s no direct online head-to-head competition, so you’re always just playing against ghost data in glorified leaderboards. Locking fairly minimal online features behind a subscription is pretty cheeky.</p>

<p>Finally there is a local multiplayer mode that allows for up to eight players to take on levels competitively. Obviously I’d recommend only doing this hooked up to a TV as visibility becomes an issue with more than two players. This mode really brings back the glory days of playing with/against my brother and triggered waves of nostalgia, even if the actual games were different from my own experience. My kids enjoyed the micro challenges and I’m hopeful that this will be a gateway into them trying some of the full original games too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/4365760492630422412" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Shiro looks ahead to major&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>content drops for August and October, with more to come in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. Suffice it to say you're eating well if you're a&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<p>First up, if you felt like&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-dlc-the-tavern-opens-release-date">recent tavern DLC</a> was too combat-light for your tastes, you'll be pleased to know a more battle-focused DLC pack is coming in August.&nbsp;<em>The Pits&nbsp;</em>promises 25 uniquely-designed battles across five distinct locations, and you'll need your wits about you to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-new-combat.jpg?itok=AE-EDLl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-new-combat.jpg?itok=Ps_C0WhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales</em>' new&nbsp;<em>The Pits&nbsp;</em>DLC will offer plenty of new combat challenges.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that, a fourth community update will arrive in October, bringing lots of new additions to the game. Unlike&nbsp;<em>The Pits</em>, the update will be free for all players.</p>
<p>Community Update 4 will offer the chance to engage in drop-in, drop-out co-op with your friends, so you can join an in-progress&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>game whenever you feel like it and leave when things are getting too hairy for you.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can look forward to a new champion and several new places of interest to explore, as well as some balance changes to smooth out your&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>experience.</p>
<p>Beyond that, another DLC is apparently planned for the fourth quarter of 2024, although Shiro is remaining quiet as to what you can expect from that DLC. We'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>As such, you can expect a gritty story filled with gray morality, as well as tough turn-based combat that will challenge your strategic planning and forward thinking skills.</p>

            <p>
England superstar Jude Bellingham makes the box art of EA Sports FC this year. 
</p>
<p>
Fresh from unpacking his bags after England's attempt at glory in the Euros, Bellingham was announced today as having taken the coveted cover slot. 
</p>
<p>
It's not a huge surprise. Bellingham also features on the EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition cover, alongside football/product placement legend David Beckham and Spanish star Aitana Bonmatí. Zinedine Zidane and Gianluigi Buffon also appear.

<p>
"I played this game with my brother all the time growing up," Bellingham said of the series once called FIFA. "I've always thought about how incredible it would be to one day be featured on the cover. 
</p>
<p>
"There have been so many iconic players on the cover over the years, and I am delighted to be the most recent English player to be bestowed with this honour since 2011."
</p>
<p>
2011 featured Wayne Rooney, if you recall.
