            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Friends, you might not know it by scrolling through my author page here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but there were a few years where I was really disillusioned with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>. For a few generations, I played the games, but I wasn’t living and breathing Game Freak’s monster-catching RPGs like I am now and did as a kid. This wasn’t because the games weren’t resonating with me, but because I’d been kind of annoyed by the types of competitive-focused fans I suddenly found myself surrounded by in my high school years. All these years later, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has you encountering a group of similarly snobby, pretentious, gatekeeping </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>battlers, and putting the smack down on them was one of the most karmically satisfying moments in the game for me.</span></p> <p><span>As the kids around me grew up in my small Georgia hometown, it seemed like their relationship to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>changed. They stopped caring about who their favorite little guys were and started crunching numbers and making spreadsheets, suddenly becoming very concerned about the competitive viability of these monsters above all else. I tell a guy Beautifly is one of my favorite Pokémon and he starts preaching to me about how she’s a weak point in my team because she’s a frail bug. Bro, I don’t give a fuck, look how pretty she is. Eventually, the constant competitive-focused conversational detours those people insisted upon became so obnoxious, they pushed me out of the space. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>was always a social outlet for me, so to feel like I couldn’t really connect with other people through our mutual love of the world and its mysterious creatures soured me on it almost entirely.</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, I found my way back. The </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>game was the first step back in the door, as its mystery adventure mechanics and hopeful view of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe struck a chord with me in 2018. Then the movie came out, the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games and </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span> had me tethered to my Switch, and I could not have been more back. I watch competitive play at arm’s length, but I’m still hankering to go to the World Championships some day. By and large, though, I play these games for the worldbuilding, the story, and to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>hang out with Raichu</span></a><span>. Don’t tell me how to make my Pokémon better for a hypothetical tournament I’ll never compete in. I do not wish to know.</span></p>

  <p><span>I’m not the only one who feels this way, either, as evidenced by a group of kids in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> who call in Lumiose City’s mob equivalent to, with your help, get some competitive snobs to leave them alone. Lumiose City has a group called the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, which is led by the fairy-type trainer Jacinthe, a rich socialite who has a large amount of influence in the Paris-inspired metropolis. She is also, as you will come to find out, someone who insists upon herself, shows up uninvited, and puts literal barriers up to trap people into doing what she wants, and she seems to be involved in some kind of odd, fetishistic relationship in which she makes Lebanne dress up as a maid as some kind of humiliation ritual. That insistence seems to trickle down to the rest of the SBC members, as our first encounter with them is during a quest in which the player is running errands for the Rust Syndicate. A pair of these elites has started hounding a group of children, probably aged between five and eight, about how to make their Pokémon the Very Best Like No One Ever Was. Are you feeding your Pokémon the right supplements to ensure they’re competitively viable? If not, the SBC will come find you and pester you in broad daylight.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637287">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>So these poor kids call in for backup, and because I am indebted to the Rust Syndicate, that backup is me. The kids run up to me with distressed looks on their faces, and say they were just having battles on their own before the two people dressed way too well to be hanging out on a battle court started “lecturing” them about the importance of competitive viability. “I bet they’re just trying to show off to us because nobody their own age will put up with them,” one says. And despite all their insistence upon their own competitive superiority, my team wipes them out, and they go running off to their homebase with their Slowpoke tails between their legs. It was cathartic.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is such an expansive franchise that it can mean different things to different people. Some fans only engage with the games, others with the anime or card game, and some may just like having plushes on their desk. A series this big and broad is never just one thing to everybody, and trying to insist that it should be is the kind of toxicity that pushes people out. There will always be bad apples in the community that want everyone to conform to their vision of things, but at least I got to send my own personal </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>snobs packing.</span></p>

<figure data-uuid="b51b6ca716c9a"><a title="3DS Virtual Console" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b51b6ca716c9a/3ds-virtual-console.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time to talk trademarks again, as Nintendo of America has had a new filing for 'Virtual Console' bumped up to the pending phase. But let's be clear right from the jump, it <em>probably</em> doesn't mean what you're thinking.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT" tabindex="-1">@MikeOdysseyYT</a> on X, the <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=79425775&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademark</a> was initially submitted on 21st April 2025, and got boosted up to the pending phase last week on 17th October. The application pertains to two different goods and services classes: IC 009 for "Recorded electronic game programs; downloadable electronic game programs; recorded video game programs" and the like, and IC 041 for "Providing non-downloadable online electronic publications, namely online journals and interactive online blogs featuring user generated or specified content in the field of video games and online publications in the nature of e-books in the field of video games" amongst other things.</p>
<p>NOA currently has two other trademarks for Virtual Console (one renewed in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77975875&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2018</a> and one in <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77014121&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">2020</a>), each of which is only linked to one of the two 'Goods and Services' classes outlined above.</p>

<p>But does this mean that Virtual Console will be making a comeback? Probably not, honestly. Trademarking is a long-running game of protection, and Nintendo is <em>always</em> on top of it. The company issues renewals all the time, ensuring that its wording, names and IP all remain under the same legal umbrella — some of them turn into something, but most of them are just to keep everything on lock.</p>
<p>That said, this <em>isn't</em> a renewal. The application in question is for a new trademark, with the two pre-existing Virtual Console ones staying where they are. The fact that the newbie compiles the Goods and Services classes of the two others makes us think that this is just a pre-emptive way to move everything into one neat TM, but excited speculation is bound to lean in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Even putting the typical behaviour of trademarks to one side, we can't imagine that Nintendo would be considering bringing back the Virtual Console program while it continues to put Nintendo Switch Online front and centre. Sure, it would be lovely to get the chance to buy some of these classics on modern hardware, but why risk NSO subs in the process?</p>
<p>So yes, there may soon be a new trademark in town, but let's not get those hopes up, eh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile on January 20, 2026, with the game set to receive a final update today (October 20) followed by a series of limited-time events from now until just before the shutdown on January 20.</p>



<p>The Sims Mobile first launched on March 6, 2018, and by January 21, 2026, after seven years of updates and content that players paid for, the game will be rendered entirely unplayable. A post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/515222130291376715?l=english">official X (formerly Twitter) account announced the news</a> of the game's shutdown, but <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">a blog post on the official EA website</a> further dug into what this shutdown means.</p>



<p>Unlike previous examples of games being shut down where they will available to players who still have the game downloaded and on their device, not only will The Sims Mobile be unavailable for players to redownload from their library after January 20, it won't be playable for those who have it downloaded. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey Simmers,</p><p>We have some sad news today. After seven years and more than 50 updates, The Sims Mobile is releasing its final update. From January 20, 2026, at 1:59 PM UTC, TSM will no longer be accessible to play and will be sunset.</p><p>From today, all in-app purchases have been… <a href="https://t.co/quUA1UcPzF">pic.twitter.com/quUA1UcPzF</a></p></div>— The Sims Mobile (@TheSimsMobile) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSimsMobile/status/1980122238981665180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The game's servers are shutting down as of 1:59pm UTC, making the game entirely unplayable and players saved data inaccessible. The game will be delisted from digital stores tomorrow, October 21, and as of today, players can no longer make in-game purchases for The Sims Mobile. On January 6, 2026, the entire content library for the game will be unlocked for players, giving anyone still around free reign with all of the game's content for two weeks, before it disappears forever.</p>



<p>There's no explanation or even a suggestion as to why The Sims Mobile is shutting down after seven years. The blog post concludes with the development team writing, "<em>On behalf of the entir</em><em>e Sims Mobile</em> team, thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us. We hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims."</p>



<p>What might be a reason for its departure, however, is the coming of a new Sims mobile game to take its place. Last year, per a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/ea-only-plans-to-make-concentrated-bets-in-mobile-following-a-flurry-of-cancellations/">MobileGamer.Biz</a>, EA briefly spoke about a new Sims mobile game in the works codenamed "<em>Project Stories</em>." A release window was not shared, but it could be the case that we'll see a full reveal for this new title in 2026, hence the shutdown of The Sims Mobile at the start of next year.</p>



<p>Or, it could also be that this is the first of what could be multiple project shutdowns as EA finds a way to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">pay the $20 billion in debt from its $55 billion buyout</a>, and in fact the aforementioned unrevealed Sims mobile game is also set to be cancelled, with development teams waiting to learn if they've been laid off or not.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-simpsons-hit-and-run-futurama-mod</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/theres-a-simpsons-hit-run-futurama-mod-and-you-can-play-a-demo-right-now.1329601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of modders calling itself Slurm Team has created a mod for the classic 2003 open-world game&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Futurama</em>, and you can check out a demo right now.</p>

<p>As spotted by the good folks at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-simpsons-hit-run-modders-have-made-their-own-futurama-total-conversion-with-future-and-ramas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>,&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s demo is available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">download now</a> from Mod Bakery, and it's got a pretty significant slice of the final mod for you to take a look at as well.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>requires you to have a copy of the original game on PC, and you'll also need the Lucas'&nbsp;<em>Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>Mod Launcher program, which, as the name suggests, allows you to launch mods for the game (as well as adding various other improvements).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=-t_qDKBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=qrOBjT7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>has a demo for you to check out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The demo comes complete with four story missions and a bonus mission, as well as a wager race and three street races by way of side activities. It's also got four costumes and six vehicles for you to drive.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to nine "gags" and one "secret gag", as well as 25 wasps that serve as the mod's collectibles.&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>even comes with a custom version of&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s map based on New New York, as well as custom music.</p>

<p>There is one caveat, though. Slurm Team says&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>comes with generative AI-based voice acting for now; the team already has "professional voice artists" lined up for the full mod release, but for now, you'll hear AI voices. If that's a deal-breaker, you may want to wait for the mod's full release.</p>




<p>This is probably the closest thing you're going to get to an actual&nbsp;<em>Futurama&nbsp;</em>video game in the near future (assuming you're not content with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skins</a>, that is), so if you're a fan of the futuristic animated comedy series, I'd recommend giving the mod a look.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-mobile-shutdown-january</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down early next year, and that the update being made available today will serve as the game's final patch before shutdown.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>website, EA says the game's servers will be closing down on January 20th next year. Since this is an online-only game, that means you won't be able to play it anymore, and it doesn't sound like there will be any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a> either.</p>

<p><em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s final update will offer the chance to experience several seasonal events between now and January, including today's Eerie Autumn event, Season's Greetings in December, and the New Year's Dock and Roll treasure hunt towards the end of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=OhGJm3Rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=efPDojjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>isn't sticking around for much longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's update also marks the end of the ability to purchase in-game currency for real cash in&nbsp;<em>The Sims Online</em>. Any SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets you still have in the game can be used until the date of the game's shutdown.</p>

<p>Additionally, EA is awarding all players unlimited energy to "complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play", and on January 6th, all of&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s in-game content will unlock for all players, which EA says will help you to "experience everything&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>has to offer" before it disappears.</p>

<p>If you've already downloaded&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>but you've deleted it from your device, you can download and play it again until January 20th, but after that date, both the game and any save data you might have will be deleted for good.</p>

<p>EA doesn't clarify a reason for&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>being delisted, but it's pretty easy to guess that the game isn't pulling the kind of player numbers the publisher wants in order to keep the experience alive.</p>

The game will be delisted from those storefronts tomorrow, so you've got until then to download it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which may shed some light on why ill-fated third-person shooter&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>flopped so disastrously when it launched earlier this year, and the reasons are probably going to sound pretty familiar to you.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> for the BBC, reporter Tom Richardson spoke to former staff who worked for developer Build a Rocket Boy (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">underwent a hefty round of layoffs</a> earlier this year following&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s release).</p>

<p>An ex-developer known as "Jamie" (which isn't their real name) told Richardson that <i>Everywhere</i>, the user-generated content sandbox which was BARB's initial focus, was "quite special", but that once the studio's focus shifted to&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, boss Leslie Benzies "never decided what game he wanted to make".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=CVb_3x0x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=uUDg0txO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A former Build a Rocket Boy developer described sandbox project&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>as "quite special".</figcaption></figure><p>Jamie says there was "no coherent direction" on&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s development, and that Benzies would routinely request huge changes to features or missions in the game. Jamie says the team referred to these bug and feature requests as "Leslies", and that they "had to be taken care of" immediately.</p>

<p>Additionally, former staff at Build a Rocket Boy allege that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was developed under crunch conditions, with staff routinely working additional unpaid overtime hours during the week in order to finish the game.</p>

<p>Former employee Margherita Peloso, known as Marg, says they attempted to raise concerns regarding the state of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, but that they were "laughed at" by management. Marg says staff felt they were "commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return".</p>

<p>According to Richardson, ex-Build a Rocket Boy workers are "pessimistic" about whether&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>can be turned around, despite assurances from BARB that this is the studio's intention.</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to a decidedly negative reception from both players and critics alike (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye" rel="nofollow">ourselves very much included</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">game's launch</a> resulted in players requesting refunds over what they perceived to be unacceptable bugs and performance issues, as well as a sponsorship for streamer CohhCarnage being pulled at the last minute as reports of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s many problems poured in.</p>

<p><em>MindsEye</em>'s launch was so bad, in fact, that it appears to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">reconsider its entire relationship</a> with third-party publishing, although that didn't stop UKIE boss Nick Poole from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ukie-nick-poole-mindseye-scottish-gaming" rel="nofollow">seemingly citing the game</a> as an example of the strength of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

            <p>One of the actors starring in the rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-zero">Resident Evil 0</a> Remake has seemingly been unearthed, via a codename listed on his resume. In case you're wondering who it is, he played various characters, possibly including a mine-dwelling cultist, in FarCry 5.</p>
<p>As a refresher, this is the Resident Evil 0 remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">Twitterer Dusk Golem claimed to be in development</a> alongside a Code Veronica remake last year. Those claims were corroborated by VGC. Dusk Golem's <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362">since asserted</a> that the "broad goal we're roughly looking at" for the two projects are early 2027 for Code Veronica and 2028 for Resi 0.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to today and the CV of Canadian actorman Jon McLaren. <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">MP1st</a> report that the codename for the Resi 0 remake is 'Chamber' and the <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren">version of McLaren's online resume</a> listed on casting profile site Actors Access cites him as having nabbed a lead role in an "upcoming AAA video game" with that same codename.</p>
<p>His work on Project Chamber's also listed as having taken place at <a href="https://www.beyond-capture.com/beyond-projects">Beyond Capture Studios</a>, a casting and capture studio who've previously worked on Capcom's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> and its Separate Ways add-on. It's hardly the only game they've worked on though, with credits on stuff ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a>.</p><p>So, who is this actorman? Well, he's previously provided the voice of Star Lord in Marvel's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, as well as the voices of "various" FarCry 5 characters. I decided to do a bit of digging into the latter, and found that his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_McLaren">Wikipedia</a> only lists him as having voiced the Ubisoft shooter's Catamount Mines Cultist. An attempt to put the matter to bed by scanning the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6967966/fullcredits/">credits on IMBD</a> has only yielded an error message, so I'm choosing to believe McLaren voiced every single living thing in Montana, including all of the animals.</p>
<p>Outside of that, McLaren earns maximum Canada points for having starred in a TV movie called '<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweet_as_maple_syrup">Sweet as Maple Syrup</a>' and lists "SAXOPHONE, DRIVERS LICENSE" among his special skills. Whether the latter means he has a special drivers' license which allows him to play the riff from Baker Street while motoring along at 70 miles an hour remains a mystery.</p>

              <p>Your beloved older laptop’s biggest problem might not be that balky spacebar you’ve already replaced twice, or the big scratch on the lid. If it’s been sort of gasping and wheezing along, it could just be an issue of storage, or lack thereof. An overstuffed hard drive in a PC laptop or desktop is an unhappy hard drive, and an unhappy hard drive can bring everything to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>You could replace the whole thing, obviously, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/">you could give the old fella a new lease on life for as little as $55 by hitting Amazon for their deals on the Samsung 870 EVO 2.5-inch SSDs</a>, ranging in size from 500GB all the way up to a monstrous 4TB. It’s like a brain transplant, but far less expensive, and with no bonesaws needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Faster, Better</h2>
<p>We’ve established that replacing an older, smaller internal SSD with a Samsung 870 EVO doesn’t require a pile of money, but it also doesn’t require a mastery of IT skills. Once you back up your old drive to a reliable external storage device, swapping it out for the Samsung 870 EVO is a fast, easy procedure. Restore your files to the new drive, and the difference in performance will be immediately obvious. That’s due in part to the vastly superior speed of the 870 EVO — sequential speeds of up to 560/530 MB/s.</p>
<p>Unlike your old drive, the 870 EVO is up to the heaviest of tasks, including 8K video processing, and it’s built with durability and length of life in mind — the 4TB model is guaranteed by Samsung for up to 2,400 TBW (terabytes written). And, while it is absolutely recommended that you do a little research beforehand to ensure the Samsung 870 EVO is compatible with your laptop or desktop PC, it’s been compatibility-tested for a massive array of host systems and applications, including chipsets, motherboards, NAS, and video recording devices.</p>



<h2>Who Knew?</h2>
<p>Samsung has been renowned for so many high-quality tech products over the years, from TVs to smartphones, home appliances to tablets, laptops to wireless earbuds, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Samsung has also been the world’s leading brand for flash memory for over two decades, all the way back to 2003. Whether you’re opting for the 500GB model of the 870 EVO for just $55, going all the way up to the 4TB for $260, or somewhere in between, you’re getting an internal drive from the world’s leading brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/">The current Amazon deal is for the 500GB model of the Samsung 870 EVO — it’s 27% off right now, bringing its price down from $75 to $55</a>. The 1TB ($95), 2TB ($180), and 4TB ($260) models are currently listed at full price. But even if you’re looking to replace a 500GB hard drive, the Amazon deal for just $55 delivers a far faster, more advanced drive than your current one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has revealed that the announcement for Starfield’s PS5 port will not arrive until 2026. </p>



<p>Starfield’s PS5 port is something players have been hearing about since the first lot Xbox titles made it over. We have already heard rumours about the space-adventure title releasing for PS5 in 2026, and now new rumours about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 port</a> have surfaced as well. However, it seems none of this will be officially announced this year. </p>



<h2 id="h-starfield-s-ps5-port-will-be-announced-in-2026">Starfield’s PS5 Port Will be Announced in 2026</h2>



<p>NateTheHate was recently asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), whether he had any new information to share about Starfield’s PS5 launch. The insider replied stating “believe the announcement will be in 2026 unless plans change.” The insider had previously confirmed that the game is indeed releasing for the PlayStation 5, and the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-its-once-again-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intent</a>” of releasing the port should be announced in 2025. However, now it seems that players won’t see an announcement until next year. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/">report</a> from another source had stated earlier this year that Starfield and it’s new expansion should release for PS5 by Spring 2026. Moreover, a Starfield port for PS5 has never been ruled out by Microsoft. When Phil Spencer was asked about this specific topic, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “here’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda teased Starfield ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post. Additionaly, the developers have mentioned the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next DLC three times</a>, but haven’t confirmed any details.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fallout: New Vegas celebrated its 15-year anniversary on October 19, 2025. Below, we take a fond look back at the flexibility and humor that helped define it as one of the best Fallout games, and an enduring classic RPG.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Fallout: New Vegas released back in 2010, there was an air of confusion. Fallout 3 had released in 2008 and Bethesda had successfully resurrected the somewhat-dormant series from a quirky isometric role-playing game to a first-person exploration game akin to its success with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. After a successful run of downloadable content, Bethesda Game Studios moved on to work on its next Elder Scrolls project. But like a deathclaw to radiation, the wasteland started calling players once again.</p><p dir="ltr">Enter Obsidian Entertainment, a studio formed from the ashes of Black Isle Entertainment. Filled with industry veterans who had a hand in creating acclaimed role-playing titles such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Baldur’s Gate, the prestigious studio was recruited by Bethesda parent company ZeniMax to craft a new experience in the post-nuclear wasteland separate from what Bethesda Game Studios had done with Fallout 3.</p><p dir="ltr">The result was Fallout: New Vegas, a wholly original experience that used Bethesda’s engine and framework from Fallout 3 but tapped into the quirkiness and deep role-playing elements that were found in the original two games. So while on the surface, many could mistake New Vegas for a glorified expansion of 3, under the hood was an RPG experience that was far deeper and more complex than anything presented in its predecessor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586938-ss_ac7dbb6b5d1353ec1e66110fe652883b957a70e3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586938-ss_ac7dbb6b5d1353ec1e66110fe652883b957a70e3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586938"></a><figcaption>Fallout: New Vegas</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586938-ss_ac7dbb6b5d1353ec1e66110fe652883b957a70e3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Fallout: New Vegas follows The Courier, a delivery person trudging through the Mojave wasteland of Eastern California, Northern Arizona, and Southern Nevada. When they get an order to deliver the mysterious Platinum Chip, they’re ambushed by Benny (played by the late Matthew Perry) and left for dead in a shallow grave. When they’re rescued and resuscitated by local townsfolk, they set out through the wasteland to figure out what happened to them.</p><p dir="ltr">While Bethesda’s take on open-world RPGs encourages exploration in any direction, Obsidian decided to curate the player’s experience. Unlike in Fallout 3 where the player’s story and memories were made out in a virtual field, New Vegas guides players along a set story path, peppering in vignettes where their actions and decisions will affect more than their personal outcomes. Sure, one could make a beeline straight for the bright lights of New Vegas, but they would miss the stories in the surrounding Mojave and be forced to face over-leveled enemies. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas isn’t afraid to get brutal and unforgiving with its RNG-based combat system, where every pull of the trigger is a roll of the dice. Every combat encounter was a fight for survival, though silver-tongued players could use the dialogue system to get out of sticky situations too.</p><p dir="ltr">This helps hammer home perhaps Fallout New Vegas’ most interesting quality: The Courier is not the main character. While The Lone Wanderer and their story to find their father was the main focus in Fallout 3, The Courier is but a small piece of the Mojave pie. The Mojave Wasteland is under siege from numerous factions such as the New California Republic, Caesar’s Legion, and Mr House: the leader of New Vegas himself. There are also numerous smaller factions such as the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel that have stories in the Mojave that the player can influence.</p><p dir="ltr">These major factions also were unique in their aesthetics and beliefs. The NCR believed in a governing system much like our modern "democratic" system featuring soldiers decked out in military fatigues and with a standard arsenal to match. The Legion dressed as ancient Romans and believed in the supremacy of their monarch Caesar, no matter how flawed he was. Mr. House well … Mr. House wanted full control of everyone, resulting in ultimate power. Players could choose which of these factions to help out or pit against each other, and there was never a right or wrong answer. Always murky shades of gray (or in New Vegas’ case, murky shades of brown). The faction system made players have a small but influential role in a larger world and governing system that helped decide the fate of the Mojave. Helping one faction would lower your standing with another and sometimes players would even need to wear disguises through certain territories if their standing was too low. The faction system has never quite returned in the series though Fallout 4 attempted to recreate the system to little success that was riddled with less complex choices and consequences.</p><p dir="ltr">That’s not to say New Vegas was all serious business as the game reintroduced a healthy amount of quirky humor evocative of early entries in the series, even dedicating a perk called “Wild Wasteland” that when chosen would introduce more humor events into its world. Whether it be an Indiana Jones reference with a fedora stored in a derelict refrigerator or the presence of a UFO, or a gang of grannies that rob you the moment you hit the strip, there was no shortage of humor in New Vegas’ world.</p><p dir="ltr">There has never been quite an entry in the Fallout series such as New Vegas. It was a melding of new ideas from Bethesda with the old philosophy of role-playing from the classic early entries. It wasn’t a game where the player was the hero but one where the player was an active participant, helping shape it with very small decisions made. New Vegas, even 15 years later remains influential today, inspiring countless RPGs from Bethesda’s own Fallout 4, to Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds, and you can even see influence from the faction system in games such as Star Wars: Outlaws. New Vegas is even inspiring television, as Amazon Prime’s Fallout series is set to have New Vegas as its central setting and even feature Mr. House as a major character. Fifteen years later, Fallout: New Vegas remains one of the most captivating role-playing experiences in gaming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anjali-bhimani-talks-puppy-role-2-new-and-returning-characters-and-how-to-dm-d-d-as-a-dog.1329565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forming the perfect mix of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, puppies, and supporting a worthy cause, we got to sit down this week to discuss Puppy Roll 2, an upcoming charity livestream being hosted by Anjali Bhimani with special guests that fans of the actual play world will be more than familiar with.</p>

<p>"The Puppy Roll is a livestream charity that I started last year along with the good folks at Petco Love," Bhimani launched into an explanation of the event, "This charity is all about helping other animal shelters and adoption initiatives across the country."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//JcU7yj99uxY"></iframe></p>

<h2>Players And Their Pets</h2>

<p>"The conceit of the event itself is that you will see familiar faces from your screen, whether that be TV and film, or the TTRPG Actual Play spaces playing D&amp;D as our pets. It is delightful chaos, I will be the DM - the Doggie Master - and I can't wait to do it again.</p>

<p>The full cast of The Puppy Roll is as follows:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Anjali Bhimani &amp; Charley as The DM</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Matthew Mercer &amp; Omar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Aabria Iyengar &amp; Suvi</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashley Johnson &amp; Sully</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Maggie Robertson &amp; Cricket</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Jonathan Graziano &amp; MIlton</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ginny Di &amp; Pablo</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Emily Axford &amp; Bruce</li>
</ul><p>Hearing that Axford would be joining the table I did want to see how Bhimani was feeling knowing that who that AP scene has coined as a chaotic player would be at her table. "The thing that I find remarkable about her, and remarkable about so many players is that despite the fact that what we see as viewers is chaos there is also this virtuosic ability to understand that what the story might need at that moment"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-some-players.jpg?itok=6hmK62DO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-some-players.jpg?itok=ZCxs_vcr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bhimani complimented the ability that a lot of the players at this table have to funnel the chaos not to be disruptive but that it supports it. "I never feel like Emily is taking out DM in the wrong direction, it might surprise your DM and any time she can surprise Brennan Lee Mulligan I support it because that's one of the smartest men aline, I don't even know how you can surprise him."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They may seem like they're taking crazy choices, but they're choices that are supporting the story"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to the mention of cats in this year's title there are cats getting brought into the picture. Ginny Di and Emily Axford will be joining the table of dogs as their pet cats.</p>

<p>Focusing on the idea of the Puppy Roll starting as dogs, before expanding Bhimani spoke a bit about the relationship she had with her own dog Charley. "I had such an incredible relationship with our dog Charley, he was so much of who I am and many of the parts of myself that I like came from loving him and learning how to love him better."</p>

<p>"That connection that we have with animals, whether they're our animals or other people's animals, but there are so many relationships that are extraordinary between humans and animals"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They give us so much healing so with them giving us so much it means so much to be able to return that to them."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Em-BARK-ing On An Adventure</h2>

<p>The Puppy Roll is going to be a direct sequel to the original adventure, picking up with the same heroes as they continue to adventure. Talking more about the plotline Bhimani explained "We will be in the land of Doggo and some of the locations within Doggo, but we will also be exploring outside of Doggo." That's where Bhimani cut me off for fear of spoilers…</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-dm-anjali.jpg?itok=mLKfZ1e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-dm-anjali.jpg?itok=V86oFLka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To create an adventure of dogs means that the world also has to be filled with dogs. Discussing the ways roleplaying people and pooches differ Bhimani was able to shed some light on the situation "It's so much fun, the Puppy Roll last year was the second time I've DM'd and I think there's some freedom to 'I don't know what I don't know'." One thing that she did want to make clear was that these dogs aren't anthropomorphic dogs, but instead the pets as they are in real life.</p>

<p>Bhimani shared a fascinating anecdote about sitting on a plane shifting between writing her published adventure, The Malady of Minarrh, while also working off the different Dungeons &amp; Dragons source books to find what spells and magical items would fit into a world of puppy puns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I had two windows and one of them was like demon possession, and the other one was about puppy puns and I was like 'this is the extraordinary thing that is my life'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing to discuss the idea of translating your own pet into a D&amp;D character Bhimani was firm on the idea of creating characters that were accurate to the real life counterparts. "Cricket, the cleric, worships Maggie Robinson, that is her deity. What these players have been able to do is think 'if I'm still here what is it about my pet that makes them a particular class.'"</p>

<p>Honing in on one example she talked about Omar, Matthew Mercer and Marisha Ray's corgi. "He's such a perfect Paladin/Barbarian. He is so noble, he is such a protector, he also kinda has this crazy energy. When you see Matt playing it you totally will understand it."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-petco-love.jpg?itok=l_tgq8hN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-petco-love.jpg?itok=VBjtc-li 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you're planning on watching the stream then you can also donate to a good cause not just to change the lives of animals with the support of PetCo Love, but also alter moments in the game. There are donation incentives and wars that will allow you to gift the players or DM ins-paw-ation or advantage.</p>

<p>For those who aren't able to catch the stream live there will be additional waves of giveaways and chances to donate too. Bhimani jokes that the only reason they even took down the tiltify for last year's Puppy Roll is because they wanted to put up the one from this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can check out The Puppy Roll II live on October 20, 2025, at 6 pm PST on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgOvCVQ5U3nNeoka-GroeQ" rel="nofollow">Anjali Bhimani's YouTube channel</a> where the VOD will stay available to watch at any time.

            <p>A number of former staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developers Build A Rocket Boy have offered some more details on alleged mismanagement at the company. They claim that director Leslie Benzies "never decided what game he wanted to make" during development of both dodgy action-adventure MindsEye and the umbrella game creation tool Everywhere. The former developers also paint a picture of disruptive micro-management, with issues Benzies spotted being named after him and forced to the top of the priority list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo">the BBC</a>, which follows 93 current and former staff at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-devs-accuse-studio-execs-of-disastrously-mishandling-redundancies-and-enforcing-unbearable-crunch">signing an open letter</a> accusing the studio's senior leadership of having "consistently mishandled the redundancy process" when laying off between 250 and 300 staff. The letter signees also claim BARB mandated "unbearable levels of overtime" around the game's launch.</p>
<p>These developers have also filed legal claims against the studio, with help from the Independent Workers of Great Britain union. Build a Rocket Boy have said they handled the redundancies "with care and transparency, meeting all our obligations", adding that they're "listening closely to feedback from former employees and are committed to learning and growing from it".</p>
<p>"Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make," said 'Jamie', an anonymous former Build a Rocket Boy developer who left the company in 2022. They described the studio's initial pitch for Everywhere - an online game creation tool organised around a city hub, which BARB have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/">shelved</a> while they work on fixing MindsEye - as "something quite special". The studio managed to pull in a lot of cash in those early days, accruing more than £233 million of investment by 2024, but were still posting losses.</p><p>Mismanagement was rife at BARB, former employees say, with former associate producer Margherita 'Marg' Peloso alleging their attempts to raise concerns about issues were "laughed off". Benzies in particular is singled out as having made things worse with his approach to highlighting problems in the game, with the devs citing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ztKumy2bpk">YouTube video</a> on Build a Rocket Boy's channel that shows the director playing the game while instructing folks to pen down issues with the likes of fire extinguishers and raindrops.</p>
<p>The ex-staff say these fix requests were known as "Leslie tickets", with Jamie saying they were also dubbed "Leslie bugs" or just "Leslies". The issue, they claim, is that such bugs or sometimes requests to scrap entire missions were all expected to be shunted straight to the front of the queue. "It didn't matter what else you were doing, what else was being worked on," said former lead data analyst Ben Newbon. "The Leslie ticket had to be taken care of."</p>
<p>Further in, Newbon cites the studio's quality assurance team as having been particularly badly affected by crunch in the run-up to MindsEye's release from mid-February to May. According to ex-Build a Rocket Boy audio programmer Isaac Hudd, "mistakes started piling up" as the devs were pushed harder, with previously fixed bugs being accidentally revived amid attempts to swat others.</p>
<p>That brings us to the current state of play, with the remaining staff at Build a Rocket Boy saying they're still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-director-reportedly-says-the-studio-will-relaunch-the-game-as-around-300-staff-are-at-risk-of-being-laid-off">committed to improving MindsEye</a>, while the former devs take action. "We all know each other, and we know how much we're worth," Peloso said of the reason they chose to speak out. "We need to stand together."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reolink-solar-powered-outdoor-security-camera-is-selling-out-fast-at-its-lowest-price-yet.1329541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Something simple you can do to your home to feel a bit safer is install a home security system. One or more outdoor cameras can bring you peace of mind, allowing you to monitor your home and keep it safe from unwanted intruders. Heck, even just having a visible camera attached to your house can be enough to deter someone from stepping onto your property. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4873/">Reolink as both a 5MP and 8MP security camera that’s solar-powered and happens to be part of an Amazon limited time deal. Right now, you can get either of these outdoor cameras for 27% off.</a> That brings the 5MP model down from $120 to $88, saving you $32 and the 8MP camera down from $150 to just $110, saving you $40.</p>
<p>The 5MP Reolink security camera is capable of recording in a detailed resolution of over 2K while the 8MP can capture even more details, recording in full 4K. The cameras work both day and night as they have support for night vision. And this isn’t that crappy kind of night vision you see in the movies. This records in full color even after dark.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4873/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 2K+ and 4K security cameras can pan and tilt, able to survey nearly a full 360 degrees. You’ll be able to view the the full extent of your property right from your laptop, phone, or tablet.</p>
<h2>Security Camera That Powers Itself</h2>
<p>The Reolink security camera system is solar-powered, which of the three ways to power a security camera is clearly the best. Lots of wireless security cameras are battery powered, so over time you’ll need to get the ladder out of the garage and up high to replace the batteries. A wired solution will never run out of charge, but you’re now limited in where you mount it to somewhere nearby an outdoor outlet. Solar power is the best of both worlds. The freedom to install it anywhere you need with the convenience of setting it up once and letting it just do it’s thing.</p>



<p>Just 10 minutes of daylight is enough to power the Reolink security camera systema full 24 hours. Five hours of sunlight will give it enough juice to run for up to four months, so no need to worry about a cloudy or rainy day every once in a while.</p>
<p>Installation is easy as pie. It’s wire-free and just clicks into place inside its mount. Should take your no more than five minutes of your day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Today, we’re talking about a viral misquote from Mario’s dad, getting an update on the<em> Sleeping Dogs</em> movie, finding out why <em>Dead Cells 2</em> was never made, and checking out the duck-themed extraction shooter that is also the latest Steam sensation. Oh, and it’s Monday. Boo! But hey, not every day can be as cool as Saturday. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <h2><strong>An Inaccurate Miyamoto Quote About Old Games Went Viral Over The Weekend</strong></h2> <p>On Sunday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social">video game collector and content creator Stealth40K</a> shared a quote from a recent interview with Mario creator and legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto about old games becoming unplayable and movies lasting forever. “Games eventually stop running when newer versions come out, but films remain forever,” was the quote shared by the account.</p>

 <p>The post, now deleted, quickly went viral online, as many thought it was very funny that someone from Nintendo, a company that has made it very difficult to preserve and emulate old games, would seemingly moan about retro titles becoming unplayable one day. Lots of takes were shared and jokes made. Except there was one problem: The quote was potentially inaccurate and possibly taken out of context.</p>

 <p>As pointed out by many, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erasu.bsky.social/post/3m3kwej7aqk2g">including Erasu on Bluesky</a>, the quote Stealth40K shared online was from a press release that seemingly pulled a quote from a longer answer from a <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/nintendomuseum-interview-240925/">September 2024 interview</a> <em>Nintendo Dream Web </em>conducted with Miyamoto that delved into Nintendo IP, preserving old games, and using movies and other media to keep characters like Mario around, even as old games become harder to access. Of course, the original quote has to be translated, so unless you natively speak Japanese or ask the designer himself, it’s impossible to fully understand what Miyamoto meant, but here’s a translation of the full quote:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Ultimately, what people remember are the IPs. Games become obsolete when new versions come out. But that’s incredibly sad. We started video production partly because of that sadness -seeing our creations become playable only on Virtual Console. Even making them playable in a museum has its limits, but video content can endure forever. I envision more and more of these things accumulating, making Nintendo itself a huge brand.”</p></blockquote> <p>And to be clear: I’m not 100 percent sure this translated version of the interview is exactly what Miyamoto meant, or <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/63038">if the quote included in the press release</a> was an accurate translation or a completely new quote from Miyamoto reiterating the point he made back in 2024. But what I can tell you for a fact is that you should be careful when you see a juicy quote from a famous person or creator, as it’s possible that it’s not accurate or that it’s taken completely out of context. Be careful out there, folks.</p>

 <h2><strong>New Report Reveals More About The Rumored <em>Resident Evil 0</em> Remake&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">A new report from <em>MP1st</em> corroborates</a> previous rumors and reports about Capcom’s work on a <em>Resident Evil 0</em> remake. The outlet claims that<em> Guardians of the Galaxy</em> video game voice actor Jon McLaren is involved with the project, which is codenamed Project Chamber. It’s believed he will star as Billy Coen, one of the game’s co-protagonists. The report also details some changes the remake is allegedly making to the source material, though the reported info is a bit spoilery, so I’ll let you read the full article if you want to learn more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This new Resident Evil Zero Remake leak/rumor is true, and I believe the first real details on RE:0 shared online outside me talking about it's existence, delay, change of hands on developer, &amp; 2028 release window previously:<a href="https://t.co/xMKCsDyyvI">https://t.co/xMKCsDyyvI</a></p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1980233514579845448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Dusk Golem, a well-known Capcom and<em> Resident Evil</em> insider who has a solid track record, shared the report on Twitter and claimed it was accurate. The unannounced<em> RE0 </em>remake is reportedly launching sometime in 2028, following a previously reported <em>Code Veronica</em> remake that is in development.</p>

 <h2><strong>New Duck-Themed Extraction Shooter Sells Half A Million Copies In 72 Hours</strong></h2> <p>Here’s a great reminder that you can’t predict what will be successful on Steam. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/"><em>Escape From Duckov</em></a>, a top-down single-player extraction shooter starring cute little ducks, has sold over <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/escape-from-duckov-crosses-500000-sales-in-3-days">500,000 copies in three days</a>. Wowza! Meanwhile, over on SteamDB, the game reached 180k concurrent players over the weekend. That makes it one of the most popular games on the platform, putting it above giants like <em>Rust </em>and <em>Grand Theft Auto V.</em> Will people still be playing the game in two weeks, or will everyone move on to some other new viral game? No idea, but for now at least, some cute ducks with guns have taken over Steam.</p> <h2><strong>The <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> Movie Has A Finished Script</strong></h2> <p>For nearly <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/03/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-neal-moritz-original-film-1201948700/">a decade now,</a> Square Enix and Hollywood have been trying to make a movie based on 2012’s open-world action game <em>Sleeping Dogs</em>. Over the weekend the film’s star, Simu Liu, posted a screenshot of the completed <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> script. So it seems like people are still trying to make a <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> movie. Good luck, I guess.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">in honour of our sleeping dogs script draft being done, here’s my sleepy dog 👍 <a href="https://t.co/l1KsFNDj5V">pic.twitter.com/l1KsFNDj5V</a></p> <p>— Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong><em>Dead Cells 2</em> Isn’t A Thing Because The Devs Ignored Fan Demands And Made Something New</strong></h2> <p>A lot of people love 2018’s roguelike platformer <em>Dead Cells.</em> A lot of those people would love a sequel. Instead, developer Motion Twin went and made a different follow-up game called <em>Windblown</em> that people seem to like as well, but not nearly as much as <em>Dead Cells.</em> And Motion Twin’s co-creative director and designer, Yannick Berthier, doesn’t seem to mind.</p> <p>“We are driven by what we want to make,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-cells/2-why-it-never-happened">Berthier told <em>PCGamesN</em> in a recent interview</a>. “If we were a ‘business,’ we would be talking about <em>Dead Cells 2</em> right now. We are not talking about <em>Dead Cells 2.</em> We are talking about <em>Windblown</em>, because we are a collective of individuals that are creative and want to create stuff. [If] we would have been [part of] another company, maybe the pressure to do a sequel would have been way, way stronger – I mean, internally. Externally, it’s super strong. Every post we do, we tend to have a few comments like, ‘OK, cool, when <em>Dead Cells 2?</em>‘ But it’s fine. That’s our reality.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mortal-kombat-mod-2000636690">Someone turned <em>Red Dead 2</em> into <em>Mortal Kombat</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reverts-conquest-ticket-change-48-hours-angry-backlash-2000636658"><em>Battlefield 6</em> reverted its big Conquest change after just 2 days</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-rog-xbox-ally-x-pc-gaming-handheld-comparison-2000636643">The Switch 2 stands toe-to-toe with the $1,000 ROG Xbox Ally X</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy's MindsEye is an unlikely candidate for the worst video game ever, but the closer we get to the end of 2025, the likelihood of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=15">it being regarded as the worst game this year</a> increases. To say the game has had a rough journey is an understatement, and following <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">an open letter from 93 Build a Rocket Boy (BARB) employees</a> calling out the studio's leadership for mismanagement, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo">a new BBC report</a> further details just how Leslie Benzies and BARB's leadership failed their staff and MindsEye's players.</p>



<p>BBC spoke to several former BABR employees, who offered new details about what made MindsEye's development such a poor process. One developer, who the report addresses as Jamie (not their real name) directly points to Benzies lack of direction, saying "<em>Leslie never decided on what game he wanted to make. There was no coherent direction</em>."</p>



<p>Two other former developers, Ben Newbon and Margherita Peloso, added what are arguably the most damning details with how Benzies and management responded when issues from the development team were brought up.</p>



<p>"<em>A lot of the points that we were hammering home on were just ignored and just never actioned,</em>" said Newbon. Peloso adds that when they or other employees would attempt to raise issues, management reportedly "<em>laughed at</em>" the raised concerns.</p>



<p>Issues that Benzies and management did care about, however, were ones that Benzies would spot himself during his own playtesting sessions, a process that BARB actually showed to the public in a promotional video for MindsEye.</p>

<iframe title="MindsEye - Quality Assurance with Leslie Benzies - Dev Diary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ztKumy2bpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In fairness, it's not an abnormal thing for the director of a game to playtest and point out issues that ought to be taken care of, as the above video shows Benzies doing. The issue that this video doesn't show, that Newbon and Peloso point out, is that the tickets Benzies would call out would suddenly take precedent over everything else. Developers even began calling these tickets "<em>Leslie tickets</em>," "<em>Leslie bugs</em>," or even just "<em>Leslies</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It didn't matter what else you were doing, what else was being worked on. The Leslie ticket had to be taken care of</em>," said Newbon.</p>



<p>Benzies demanding focus on whatever was most important to him in any particular moment also extended beyond quality assurance and playtesting, as Jamie regarded that, with what was meant to be BARB's first project, Everywhere, Benzies would demand new features be added into the game faster than they could be properly implemented.</p>



<p>This kind of haphazard working style, with no clear vision and new features being implemented before they've been given the necessary time to ensure they're ready is an unfortunately common story we've heard before regarding development cycles that burned out developers, whether the end product was a success or not. </p>



<p>The development of BioShock Infinite is a now infamous story of how Ken Levine was unable let anything be declared 'final,' causing a hectic development environment, to say the least. More recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a game that suffered from grave mismanagement</a> and a development process that lacked a solid direction.</p>



<p>In both those cases, as with MindsEye, the result was weeks of crunch time for developers. "<em>People just felt like they were being commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return,</em>" added Peloso. Another former developer, Isaac Hudd, added how in the run up to launch, everything piled up at once, with new bugs appearing the moment a different one was squashed. </p>



<p>"<em>And it does mess with you,</em>" Hudd said. "<em>You really do start to see the morale go down, the little arguments starting to happen. People are burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: 'What's the point?'</em>"</p>



<p>The report does add that Benzies and the leadership team of BARB "<em>take full responsibility</em>" for MindsEye, and added, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-commited-to-refininig-mindseye-major-update-4/">as we've heard before</a>, that the studio is working towards making it up to players and putting out "<em>the game we've always envisioned, and one that players are excited to play</em>."</p>



<p>Those former developers the BBC spoke to, however, don't think the game will ever actually get there. In July, BARB told players <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">that updates for MindsEye "<em>may be less frequent</em>."</a> It's last update arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/515222130291376715?l=english">September 25</a>, with no word as to when the next update will come.</p>

			<p>Barcelona-based independent developer Epictellers Entertainment came a bit out of nowhere with Starfinder: Afterlight, an upcoming cRPG adapted from Paizo's science fantasy tabletop franchise. Epictellers <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has sought funding through Kickstarter</a> and, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-80-mins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported earlier this month</a>, quickly reached the campaign's minimum goal. With sixteen days left on the campaign, they already gathered over €530K, unlocking multiple stretch goals.</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight already caught our attention, which is why I reached out to Epictellers and set up an interview with the two co-founders, Ricard Pillosu and Albert Jane Goset, to discuss this project, the ongoing Kickstarter campaign, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Tell me a bit about your studio, Epictellers Entertainment.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Albert and I founded the studio in 2023. We come from AAA companies, and we wanted a bit more of creating our own concept of a studio, smaller, and also doing a genre that is not receiving enough pay attention, which is cRPGs. Even after the enormous success of Baldur's Gate 3, not many studios are jumping into these kind of games, and we wanted to give it a try. We are fully independent, and we don't have a publisher; everything we do is by ourselves, and that was the idea.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have prior experience making cRPGs? Or did you use to make other types of games when you worked at triple-A companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> No, we have never done a cRPG. We come from very big studios with big productions like Crytek and Smilegate, where normally teams are on the hundreds and technology is very complex and so on. One of the main reasons is that we have always wanted to do a game like this. We always ended up doing shooters and things like that, which are cool, but not really close to our heart. Albert and I have known each other since we were teenagers, and we play tabletop RPGs weekly.</p>



<p>We have both been Dungeon Masters for tons of different games and we always wanted to do it, even from the very first time that we saw Baldur's Gate 1, which was an enormous influence for us and probably one of the reasons we joined the big game industry, but we never got the chance to do one because there are very few studios that work on this genre. So in the end we said, okay, let's create our own.</p>



<p><strong>Like you said, there was kind of a milestone in the genre with the release of Baldur's Gate 3, you could say. After that launch, other cRPG developers said they were worried players would suddenly expect AAA-like values from the genre. What do you think about that? Do you see it as an issue, or are you more focused on the fact that such a big title made more people interested in this type of game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> We were asking ourselves the same question last week. We do not know if people are only now going to pay attention to Baldur's Gate 3 level of quality, which is absolutely unattainable for us. Because we are a very small studio of 30 people, of course. We were very clear about Starfinder: Afterlight. When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-pc-early-access-release-date-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced it in August</a>, we put up the screenshots quickly. We aim for the kind of games Owlcat has been doing with this quality, and we see that Owlcat is performing very well commercially. We talked to them, too. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader is a fantastic game</a>, and those are on the AA level. I think that if anything, Baldur's Gate 3's coming has been positive, because there are some things you can translate to AA level. Of course, we are not going to reach that level of audience, that's for sure, but I think there is still a big enough, underserved audience for it, and they are reacting very well, and the Kickstarter is proof of it.</p>

<p><strong>Awesome. And did you cultivate a community base through Discord prior to the launch of the Starfinder: Afterlight Kickstarter? Because it seems like a lot of players were immediately eager to help with the funding</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> Actually, no, we launched Discord when we started the campaign. No, what we did was announce the game at GenCon, where, actually, Paizo, the IP holders, released the second edition of Starfinder. Pathfinder had already had a second edition a long time ago, and Starfinder's second edition book was released this summer in August, so we announced it together with them. That actually pushed a lot of people already towards the Kickstarter pre-campaign. Then we started showing some bits of information, and with the help of our PR agency, we did some interviews with Polygon and other publications, so that actually helped just carry a little bit the ball forward. We were not expecting that level of contribution. But the idea of the Kickstarter was actually to build a community that can go with us during this journey.</p>



<p><strong>Several cRPGs, like Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin, Wasteland 3, and many others, were funded through Kickstarter for a while. Lately, it seems like Kickstarter is being used more rarely, I'd say. Were you nervous before going to Kickstarter with Starfinder: Afterlight? Did you evaluate other options?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> I mean, I think anyone not nervous about Kickstarter is lying. Kickstarter is a big milestone for us. We are fully funded, so Kickstarter was more about collecting that community and reaching the stuff we couldn't have. For instance, right now, we will add more voice acting because that's one key part of our game. The characters must feel alive, so we need directors to do that. We wanted as much as possible to have voiceover, and Kickstarter is helping. I think that one of the reasons why we did Kickstarter was actually because we knew that a big part of the cRPG community had a Kickstarter account. That helped us decide, okay, let's do that. Let's see how people react. Let's gather this community. That was a big hit. But I think that, being our first Kickstarter and everything, you get nervous because you never know what to expect. Even if you have like 7,000 followers, as we did, you never know what the result will be. So it's always a gamble. But yeah, we are super happy with the community. They reacted super well. We have over 9,650 backers. It's going great.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the partnership with Paizo? Did you consider making your own IP? How did you choose the setting, and how did you approach Paizo for getting the license?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Since we decided that we wanted to do cRPGs, we were looking into getting an IP that could resonate and we were looking for something that was different enough, that felt fresh, something that is a bit uncharted territory. We love Paizo products. We didn't know if they were going to want to work with us, so we knocked on the door, but from the very first meeting, they were fantastic people. They helped us look into all their IPs, not just Starfinder. It was tough to choose, but when we asked about Starfinder, they said, yes, why not? Pitch us, what are your ideas about it? So we went into the cave and crafted what we would like to do with this, showed it to them, and they liked it. The rest is history. We have known the IP since the first edition, and we loved it. At that moment, I think everything clicked with everybody on the team. Everybody's like, wow, Starfinder will be awesome. We were also lucky that they were launching the second edition, so it was a bit of a reset of the whole concept.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, most cRPGs are, as you know, based on fantasy settings. Do you think this will help you, as it is a bit of an underserved niche in sci-fi or science fantasy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> This was one of the reasons that we wanted to do Starfinder, but we were also scared of sci-fi. It's a niche inside the cRPG, which is already a niche because you normally do fantasy. But this IP is really not hard science fiction. It's more of a fantasy moved into the world of science fiction. It's called science fantasy and allows you to blend magic. In this world, there are gods. There are priests who pray to those gods. But you also have interplanetary travel, spaceship combat, and things like this in the game. So you will have a lot of stuff that Starfinder brings to the table that is fresh, but also resonates with players who are used to fantasy.</p>

<p><strong>I guess it is more like Star Wars than Star Trek.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Yes, yes. It's more of an adventure. We really resonate more now with Guardians of the Galaxy, which is, again, craziness in space. Let's just have fun. Get our spaceship around and fight the bad guys. But it could be crazy stuff like big creatures roaming in space and magic and doing crazy stuff. It's this kind of tone.</p>



<p><strong>Are you going for a slightly comedic tone with Starfinder: Afterlight? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Yeah, which is quite hard because comedy is complex in video games. But when we play Starfinder ourselves, we have so much fun. It doesn't mean that it's a comedy game. It's the same as in the Guardians of the Galaxy movie. You would not describe it as an actual comedy. It has a comedy element, of course, but it's really an epic adventure in space. But it does not take itself very seriously. And that's what we are aiming for with this game.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the story premise for your game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Well, there are lots of things that are a bit too soon to speak about, but I can say, for example, that the name of the game is Starfinder: Afterlight. And the Afterlight is really a bad thing. It's something that happens that affects the whole galaxy. It's an extinction event you witness, yet somehow, without going into details, you will still have time to prevent. But nobody believes you. So you are there like, this is going to happen. People think you are crazy. So you need to find a new crew and try to see how to ensure it never happens. This involves undead people from a planet called Eox, but that's as much as I can say. At the beginning of the game, you will experience this kind of epiphany and then you get some time to prevent it before it happens. Then you land on a planet called Aquiton, and you need to find a crew there.</p>

People think you are crazy. So you need to find a new crew and try to see how to ensure it never happens.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I see here on the Kickstarter description that you mention branching narrative and choices. How do you approach this common CRPG feature? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Carefully. That's a lot of work. We have invested quite a lot of time in creating a set of tools for the narrative team to iterate very fast. They normally iterate with the game open. They keep writing and rewriting and adding new lines and removing lines until it feels good. We do a lot of playtests internally until everything is understood and clear. And we make sure that we do, besides the main story, then we do runs expecting other kind of characters and other events. Like, I do this quest first and then this dialogue here changes. If I am a Borai, for example, or I am a soldier, then I have this option and then we do a pass on, okay, option for the soldier, option for this new ancestry. Until it has a lot of variety and every time somebody plays, it feels a very personalized experience. So, long story short, it's just a lot of work. It's really like that.</p>



<p><strong>Will it be possible to complete quests in multiple ways in Starfinder: Afterlight? For example, sometimes without having to fight, via persuasion and stuff like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Yes, we have some internal rules for all the quests. You need to have quite a few spots to enter the quest, not only one, so you could find four or five sources to get the quest, and then the quest normally needs to have at least three ways of being finished. Fighting your way through is one of the obvious ones, but then we always try to have one that is about talking, that it's about maybe buying something, that it's about maybe circumventing the problem, and going and talk to someone, or complete another quest that will help that person align with you. So we want, as I said, people who will speak about their experience in the game with their friends, and they will be like, oh, you did that? Is that possible? Okay, maybe I will try in my next Starfinder: Afterlight run. We are actually creating more content than the players will experience. Hopefully, as much as time allows, and our budget stretches, we'll have so many options that the players will feel that each run is different.</p>



<p><strong>You estimate a 40-60-hour campaign. How much of that is the critical path, and how much is side content and stuff like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Compared to what we have worked on before, this type of game is very difficult to measure in time because there are so many ways to play it. The critical path can be done in 40 hours if you move forward very quickly, but it's difficult to move forward very quickly because it's a turn-based combat. You have to upgrade your gear. You need to raise your characters to a higher level and make a lot of choices. So it depends on where your interests are. If your interest is in the narrative, or is in combat, or is in optimizing, or you want to try combat a different way, or save and load again, the experience is going to be slower or faster. But we estimate that in around 40 hours, you will be able to finish the game, but we are internally building way more than that. We are building around 80 to 100 hours of content. Maybe you decide not to take any of the companions. Perhaps you choose to fly solo, maybe you decide to get a mercenary and two companions, and that changes the experience. So we are going to build lots of content, and you will experience around 40 to 50 percent of it.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that Starfinder: Afterlight is kind of like Divinity Original Sin meets Guardians of the Galaxy. So, with regards to the first part, are you perhaps referring to Larian's environmental interaction? Original Sin had a lot of that, where you could interact with surfaces and other objects in combat to make different reactions. Is that something that you have in the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> I don't think we will reach the enormous amount of variety that Divinity Original Sin 2 has, but we can do a lot, especially since the science fiction environment allows us many approaches to do things. So first, our game has longer ranges. When you are shooting, you have really long ranges, not like bow and arrow. And you have computers, you can sometimes control machines. We have some classes that allow you to handle magic and handle mechanics and hack computers easily. So there are many ways to do things that are normally not that intuitive in a fantasy setting. Our goal is that you will have as many interactions as we can, but it's our first game and we want to be realistic with the scope.</p>



<p>Let's see how much we can get. For example, one of the things that we sadly need to cut from the scope is flying. In science fiction, it's common that you go into areas without gravity or you have jetpacks and things like this. But again, we're a small team, humble, doing our first game. We decided to keep it to levitation only. Also, bear in mind that we aim to drop a set of modding tools shortly after launch. So if people can expand that and add more variety, they will be more than welcome. But I think that we will ship with a decent variety for the game. One thing that, after Baldur's Gate 3, will be totally unacceptable to ship without is the ability to push people down. Sometimes it is a shortcut to actually kill someone who is very powerful, but if you manage to push them off the cliff, you actually immediately kill them. This is one of the things that absolutely will be there in the game. But others, we are discussing how much we can get there because those are quite complex. </p>

Our goal is that you will have as many interactions as we can, but it's our first game and we want to be realistic with the scope.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Was it hard to adapt the triple action system from the tabletop to Starfinder: Afterlight? Did you have to make any big changes, or just small tweaks?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Actually, no. One of the things that we loved about Starfinder is that the second edition was going to use Pathfinder second edition rules. When we tried them on tabletop, we always thought those rules are meant to be in a video game because they are well-balanced, they are well-thought, mathematically make a lot of sense, and just moving them into a video game, it's actually not that difficult, especially the three-action system. But there are other things that are complex, especially things that are funny to play around in your imagination when you're in tabletop, but in video games are very difficult to handle. For example, the Ysoki, which are like rat-like folk ancestry, at some point there is one ancestry feat that they can have their tail handle guns. This is actually very simple to just write it, and in tabletop it's very funny to imagine. But the moment we look at it animation-wise and for the rig, that's quite a lot of work. Now we need to have some sort of tail that can handle guns. How do we handle that? Suddenly this could explode into a lot of work. So what we are doing is evaluating what is more feasible, what is less feasible, and then deciding which battles we want to fight. But the core of the system, it actually was fantastic. I prefer to adapt this one than the first edition or, for example, old versions of D&amp;D.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a reaction system similar to D&amp;D or Baldur's Gate, where anyone who faces a foe entering gets a free reaction?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> In Starfinder 2nd Edition, not everybody gets an opportunity attack, you actually need to have a feat, or you need to come from a class that can do it, but yes, we do. And in this case, we are going the Baldur's Gate 3 route, which I think is the best one, which is, by default, you can configure which kind of reactions you want to trigger automatically, which ones you want to ignore, and which ones you want the combat system to ask if you want to use them or not. But yes, there is a full reaction system. </p>



<p><strong>You mentioned the mod support coming later to Starfinder: Afterlight. Do you think players will eventually be able to create full campaigns with this tool? Is that the goal? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> That's what I wish for. I miss the days where with the engine from Neverwinter Nights, you could do amazing things. Again, our scope still needs to be kept realistic, and modding tools are quite a bit of work, but we have been doing all our coding with this mindset. We are using an engine that is not traditional. We are using Godot for this game, and in the spirit of open source, we use Blender for most of our art pipeline. So we are aiming to have those tools that people could use and have some documentation out there so that people may want to add a new animation, a new character, a new thing. Modding goes step-by-step, you need to decide which areas you want to allow modding and then keep growing them. Even Larian added modding later, after shipping its base games, so it's a big, big endeavor, but we have been thinking about it from the start, so I think we will have an easier time. I cannot commit to a date, but our aim is that it will be as moddable as we can. If we can have it our way, people will be able to do a Pathfinder game with it if they want.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to make Starfinder: Afterlight compatible with Steam Workshop?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> That's the idea from scratch, to work with Steam Workshop and have the game basically connect directly with that backend and allow you to add mods into your game directly connected to Steam Workshop.</p>



<p><strong>Some other games, even Baldur's Gate 3 itself, have integrated with mod.io to allow cross-platform mods that also support consoles. Is that something that's out of your scope for Starfinder: Afterlight, or do you wish it would happen at some point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> I would say that, I mean, mod.io is fantastic, but it made a lot of sense for Larian because they already were multiplatform when they were targeting that. We are not multiplatform as of right now, we are very PC-oriented. Maybe if the game commercially makes sense, we could make a console version later on, and then we will need to, of course, have those modding tools, if possible, move to those platforms. But for us, it's too soon to look into it.</p>



<p><strong>What about controller support? Will it be available on PC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> I was shocked personally that people want to play on PC with controller. It seems that it's more and more common that people use this controller, maybe have a PC next to the big TV and then play games like that. We got asked that several times and we were like, no, we are not going to console. They were like, yeah, we know, but we want controller support on PC. Actually, it's not simple. cRPGs are complex with gamepads and we know how different cRPGs try their best, but still it's a difficult marriage there. One of the things that we have in mind is that Starfinder: Afterlight will be shipping on Windows and Linux. We will be able to do a native build for Steam Deck. I don't know when, probably after launch, we'll look into it, but it will be one of the easiest moves for us to make the game running on a Steam Deck. And if you go to a Steam Deck, then you need to make it compatible with gamepad, and that process probably will allow us to have a gamepad compatible mode into the PC version itself. So I suspect that, not for launch, but pretty soon after it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Romance is a way to go deeper into knowing that character, so we try to have it as an amplifier of certain emotional moments when you are completing quests that are about companions. If you have been romancing this companion, then they will talk to you as a romantic partner and ask you what we can do here, what you would be doing, and the emotion in that moment probably could be amplified because of that factor of the previous romance connection. Also, we try to have romance not in a simplistic way. We try to make them complex and each companion will have a way to judge the things you are doing, and they will be driven a bit by your decisions. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Can you speak a bit about your approach with romances in Starfinder: Afterlight? There are some developers that are not very fond of romance in cRPGs, for example, Obsidian's Josh Sawyer openly said that, but other games have implemented the romance very successfully for their player bases, so what's your take?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> The first take is that they are optional. You could even not take your companions, or you could take your companions and play through the game without romance being a thing in the game. It's very important that it feels optional. Then the second thing is, romance is a way to go deeper into knowing that character, so we try to have it as an amplifier of certain emotional moments when you are completing quests that are about companions. If you have been romancing this companion, then they will talk to you as a romantic partner and ask you what we can do here, what you would be doing, and the emotion in that moment probably could be amplified because of that factor of the previous romance connection. Also, we try to have romance not in a simplistic way. We try to make them complex and each companion will have a way to judge the things you are doing, and they will be driven a bit by your decisions. Romances will be starting in the first act, but you need to be with that companion up until the end when you really get to fully fledge that kind of romance. But we try to make them to take that thing very seriously and make sure that each romance feels different and feels very specific to their personality and even the ancestry of the character, because Starfinder has a big variety. Even yesterday we were still having a discussion on how we deal with a romance, for example, for the Shirren, which is an insect-like ancestry species. </p>



<p>That species understands romance and relationship in a totally different way, and how do you interface with that? Actually, you could be also a Shirren, you could be a different kind of character. Some characters are telepathic, so how does this influence romance? It's quite a big endeavor. But since we understand that cRPGs are an emotional thing, even if I am a very hardcore player of optimizing my characters and do very complex combats and I enjoy combat very much, you need to have this kind of connection with the game. And in that connection normally is the emotion that you beat up, how you imagine those characters in that world or how invested you are with them. Romance needs to be taking care of that factor very seriously and optionally. But I really cannot say much more about it because we don't want to spoil any of the romances in Starfinder: Afterlight. But it's not an easy thing. Let's see how we do it.</p>



<p><strong>One of the big topics nowadays for everything, but specifically with regards to game development, is the usage of AI. So, what's your take on this? Do you think it can be a valuable tool, and do you plan to use it in some ways?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it. </p>



<p><strong>Just another thing about the Starfinder: Afterlight Kickstarter campaign. Is there a limit to how many stretch goals you've planned?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> We have a finite number of stretch goals, and yeah, we are not that far off. So I think we still have some of them. We might reach them before the end of the campaign. And that will be like, okay, that's everything we wanted to have for this game, at least for now. So yeah, there is a limit to it.  We don't want to keep adding things. But we wanted to have at least full voiceover, you know, all these kind of things that we are adding as a stretch goal. It's stuff that we feel like it's going to make Starfinder: Afterlight a better game and a full experience for the players. </p>



<p><strong>Indeed, one of the issues with some Kickstarter campaigns for games was that they kept adding a lot of stretch goals and then the project became bloated and everything.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> Exactly. It's a great thing to just keep pushing things and to get the people engaged, but I think we have a very clear idea of what we want to do with Starfinder: Afterlight, and keeping our scope and our milestones and roadmap in check, it's something that we don't want to change. That's why a lot of stuff will come after, actually, the game is released, and we already said, this is what we're going to ship with, everything else will come later on, but for now, that's what the game will have.</p>

              <p>There’s no reason for you to spend over $1,000, or even over $500, on a reliable everyday laptop. No, we’re not talking about a refurbished machine or one from a brand hardly anyone’s ever heard of.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, about 24 hours ago I had every intention of pitching a post for </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> about how I could finally forgive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-alolan-raichu-1851777665"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>, the surfing, psychic, pancake-loving regional variant of my favorite Pokémon, for its crimes. For many years, I have looked upon Alolan Raichu with disdain as it usurped the Kanto original as The Pokémon Company’s favorite Pikachu evolution. The Alolan mouse was featured in </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span>, is a playable character in the MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>, and received some significant promo in the anime and </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Meanwhile, my boy’s legacy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>has mostly seen him overshadowed by his own pre-evolution</span></a><span>, and this all began with an episode of the anime that painted him as inferior to Pikachu in battle decades ago. Then, Game Freak announced he was getting not one, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>two Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC</span></a><span>. For a moment, it seemed Raichu would finally get some respect put on his name. I’d decided I could finally forgive Alolan Raichu for stealing the spotlight and let the electric rats coexist in my mind…until this little shit showed up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with the audacity of someone who’s never been told “no” in his life.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re wondering where Alolan Raichu is in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, know it is only available in the post-game. I hadn’t given the regional variant much thought until I was heading to do a quest in Lumiose City. There I was, walking toward the Quasartico Inc. building minding my own business, Raichu by my side, when all of a sudden, I see this agitating, dopey, maple-syrup-smelling twerp hovering alongside a woman on the way in. “Pshaw!” I say in my mind as the side quest marker hovers above them, as if inviting me to inquire about this odd-looking rodent when I have spent 30 hours having only seen Raichus that are orange and have their feet planted firmly on the ground. I know who you are, Alolan Raichu, and you’re a war criminal. But then I think, maybe if I do this side quest, they’ll go away and I won’t have to see them next time I come to Quasartico’s office. So I speak to the woman. She introduces herself as Griddella, a member of CHARGE, or “Committee to Highlight Alolan Raichu and Generate Excitement.” I guess even serial killers have fandoms.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637260"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637260">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Griddella asks if our Raichus can battle, and she wants to make some ceremony of it. I have to remove all my other Pokémon from my party before I can complete the quest, so it’s just me and Raichu against Griddella and the Pocket Monster equivalent of Bizarro from </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>. The Alolan Raichu we face is decently powerful at level 64, but my guy’s at level 70 and we just finished the endgame, so we’ve faced much tougher foes than this imposter. Raichu smacks Alolan Raichu around the field a bit and then Griddella congratulates us on our win. Alright, cool. Kanto Raichu supremacy has been established. Let’s get back to what we were doing, Raichu. But no, Griddella’s not done with us yet, as she then asks a baffling question: “Let’s trade: your Raichu for my Alolan Raichu! What do you say?”</span></p> <p><span>What do I say, Griddella? I say “Hell fucking no, are you kidding me?” But the game only lets me say “No thanks,” so you will never hear the disgust with which I decline your insult of an offer. Not only have I gone to hell and back with this guy throughout </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, but he also just whooped your faker’s ass in the middle of a crowded area of Lumiose City. Why would I reward my king’s loyalty and strength by giving him to you for this second-rate phony? He’s been with me since Day One, and we have journeyed through every region of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe together, saving the day while this guy serves pancakes to people in Alola. When the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out, he’s finally going to undergo Mega Evolution like he should have a decade ago. The Pokémon Company may not respect him, but I do. I’ll never trade my OG for a pretender. Even if it means I’ve gotta see him every time I go to Quasartico’s building because they will not leave unless I make the trade. Guess that quest’s not getting finished. “Ken, just catch another Raichu and trade it.” No! It’s the principle!</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-year%E2%80%99s-cancellation-developer-says.1329496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Football Manager 26 wouldn’t have reached its current level of polish and quality if last year’s entry hadn’t been scrapped, so says Sports Interactive Design Manager Ant Farley.</p>



<p>The game marks a significant step for the franchise as it leaves behind the Sports Interactive Operating System engine in favor of the Unity engine. This change saw Football Manager 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/">suffer through</a> multiple delays <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and feature cuts</a> before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately being cancelled</a> to focus on making sure the game was up to the standards that players have come to expect from the 20+ year franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/interview-football-manager-26-definitely-benefited-from-fm25-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>, Farley says that canceling last year’s game wasn’t an easy choice to make, but it was necessary.</p>



<p><strong>“There’s no way we’d have been able to reach the same level of quality that FM26 currently has if we shipped FM25,” </strong>Farley said. <strong>“Some of the decisions where we rethought and changed direction, we’d have had to push them out there if we released FM25. And, once they’re out in the world, it becomes difficult to rethink it. We probably would have needed to fix them, rather than rethink them.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that instead of building a complete game, they would’ve been spending more time fixing bugs than anything else. But with the focus shifting towards Football Manager 26 instead, it gave them even more determination to make the best game possible. </p>



<p><strong>“The original disappointment [of the cancellation] “was tangible, but it quickly made way to an attitude of ‘let’s crack on now, we’ve got a chance to make something we are really proud of, ‘”</strong> he said. <strong>“We weren’t proud of FM25, we didn’t think it offered good value for money for our playerbase, and that’s our real motivating factor.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“When we had news of the cancellation, it gave us the determination to get it right for FM26.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launches on November 4. An open beta will be <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking place starting October 24</a>, with progress being able to be brought over to the full game post-launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 is Great, But There’s Still One Feature I Want Back]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-feature-i-want-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-great-but-there%E2%80%99s-still-one-feature-i-want-back.1329490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 continues to impress gamers, and there’s still an immense amount of life left in a roadmap that’s yet to deliver the game’s first multiplayer season and a free-to-play battle royale component. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated Battlefield 6 highly on account of its stellar multiplayer platform, but points were detracted for the less-than-desirable campaign portion of the game.</p>



<p>As I play Battlefield 6, I can’t help but find myself lusting after a feature from bygone days that hasn’t been seen in a Battlefield game since 2018’s Battlefield 5. It’s something I adored in the World War II shooter that added a layer of immersion and ownership, but it’s not present in Battlefield 6, and I mourn the loss of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-want-to-fortify-objectives-in-battlefield-6">I Want To Fortify Objectives in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>In Battlefield 5 (2018), users could take over an objective in a mode like Conquest or Breakthrough and set about <strong>fortifying it</strong>. They’d pull out their toolkit and construct everything from tank traps to sandbag walls. They could board windows, dig trenches, install machine gun nests, and set up barbed wire fences.</p>



<p>It was all pre-determined and linear, but it gave players a sense of ownership over an objective. They could capture the spot and then fully fortify it, preparing for the inevitable retake attempt from the opposing team.</p>



<p>It was also a nice way to earn an extra chunk of experience points, with the game’s support class having abilities that allowed them to craft fortifications faster.</p>



<p>Sadly, this feature was removed going into Battlefield 2042 (because the game lacked destruction), and it hasn’t resurfaced in Battlefield 6, which was released on October 10.</p>



<p>This is a shame, as Battlefield 6 has wonderful destruction that can see buildings razed to the ground, and I could imagine fortifications becoming progressively ramshackle as objectives crumble to dust under the weight of incoming fire.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/">What Should Battlefield 6 Take From Battlefield 5?</a></strong></h6>



<p>The idea came to me again while occupying objective ‘D’ on Liberation Peak, which is a site set in the middle of a road flanked by houses, all of which are begging for fortifications. It would be the best spot to lay some tank traps to prevent vehicular pushes from either end of the street, and the ruined houses are perfect for sandbagging and trenches.</p>



<p>I can fully appreciate why this <strong>isn’t</strong> a thing, of course. Battlefield 6 is a fast-paced game with immense destruction mechanics, and any fortifications would likely be taken out the second they’re built. It’s not worth the development time to implement something that can so quickly be destroyed.</p>



<p>Being an objective player, I’ll forever wish for the integration of fortifications. It’s the perfect way to gain a sense of ownership over an objective, and it’s a way for players less skilled in the gunny space to earn extra experience points and complete challenges.</p>



<p>Do you wish Battlefield 6 had fortifications? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

"Then in late December 2021, when I had like 550 crowns, I started grinding a show called Finals Marathon [...] I was playing every single minute of my free time, refusing to play other games even if a friend wanted to."</p><p dir="ltr">By April 2022, he had achieved the game’s Golden Knight costume, a symbol of prestige among fans. He quit the game several times throughout his journey, only to come back to the grind.</p><p dir="ltr">"I wanted to reach top 1 Europe or top 10 world," they wrote. "But deep down I was really dreaming of claiming the top-1 spot."</p><p dir="ltr">That dream turned into a grueling marathon of near-constant play. During one stretch in 2023, he played Fall Guys for 15 hours a day across the entire summer. His parents even grounded him after he went without sleep for two school nights. He came back to keep playing.</p><p dir="ltr">After submitting screenshots, videos, and leaderboard evidence, his Guinness record was confirmed on September 10, 2025. Yet when he shared the achievement on the Fall Guys subreddit, the reaction wasn’t all celebratory--many accused him of using in-game glitches. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/1nlzyzj/finally_got_my_guinness_world_record_after_9000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> includes a picture of his certificate and a number of comments that accused him of cheating.</p><p dir="ltr">"I used glitches," they wrote. "My main opponent who was #1 at the time used them too, so I had no other choice if I wanted to surpass him."</p><p dir="ltr">Though he says he’s since quit the game, he calls the journey "a phenomenon," adding that he's never been motivated like this before.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Communication Workers of America has announced that a "majority of video game developers" for the Hearthstone team have decided to unionize. More than 100 Blizzard Entertainment employees are joining the union, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/">following in the footsteps of the Overwatch 2 crew</a> earlier this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The unionization includes Blizzard employees who worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-rumble-will-receive-no-new-content-amidst-layoffs-at-blizzard/1100-6532929/">Warcraft Rumble, a game that went into life-support mode</a> in July. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">Microsoft announced mass layoffs</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#2">included a reported 100 Blizzard workers</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"Whether we are fighting for layoff protections, security for our remote workers, or reduced wage gaps, the pressures we face are making it harder to create the high-quality work we care about," said organizing committee member and senior 2D artist Uriah Voth in the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hearthstone-and-warcraft-rumble-developers-form-union-communications-workers-america" rel="nofollow ">CWA press release</a>. "Organizing gives us the opportunity to empower ourselves and challenge the instability and unfair conditions that undermine us."</p><p dir="ltr">The CWA notes that "Microsoft has recognized the union." In 2024, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/">World of Warcraft team started the unionization efforts at Blizzard</a> and inspired the Hearthstone developers, per CWA. Not even two months ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionize-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6534376/">the Diablo team voted to unionize</a>, as well. There are now over 1,900 Blizzard employees who are part of the union.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionize-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6534376/">Hearthstone will introduce the Across the Timeways expansion</a> on November 4.

<p>"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen," he said. "It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."</p><p>Marathon had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-alpha-update-allows-players-to-talk-about-the-game/1100-6530975/" data-ref-id="1100-6530975">an initial closed alpha test</a> in late April that resulted in a smattering of issues, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">an alleged toxic work culture at Bungie</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">stolen-art allegations</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">an indefinite delay out</a> of its September 23 release date. Meanwhile, Arc Raiders had a successful playtest, raking in 189,668 concurrent players and dominating Steam's top 10 most-played games during that "server slam" weekend.</p><p>For Watkins, the disparity between Arc Raiders and Marathon provided Embark Studios the chance to learn about the genre, player expectations, and the game the team is building. Of course, Watkins isn't dragging Marathon despite it not receiving a warm welcome from Bungie and extraction shooter fans. Instead, he's rooting for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny/" data-ref-id="5000-38799">Destiny</a> makers, saying Marathon's art style is "evocative" and that he wants to see more from Bungie.</p><p>"[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he said. "[...] I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."</p>
