					<p>Despite Deck13's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/">Atlas Fallen</a> showing much promise before release, the German studio's game failed to deliver a truly compelling experience. On paper, the mix of the combat mechanics of the Monster Hunter series and character action games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta sounded exciting, but a clunky execution of these concepts made the experience very middling despite a well-designed world with deep lore.</p>
<p>Not wanting to leave their game in a state that the studio itself did not find optimal, Deck13 has launched the Reign of Sand free <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>, which attempts to fix many of the base game's issues to present an experience that is not worthy of players's time. Does it succeed? Yes and no at the same time. While the enhancements are substantial, they go on to improve features that were already good enough to begin with, not addressing those core issues that impact the experience the most, namely the combat mechanics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atlas-Fallen-Reign-of-Sand-01.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Reign of Sand update doesn't introduce any major change to the Atlas Fallen story, as the studio opted to lightly expand it with new lore elements. So, once again, players will control a fated Unnamed who obtained the Gauntlet, an ancient and powerful artifact that grants them the power to banish the Wraith who have been plaguing the world that was once almost destroyed by the Sun God Thelos and covered in sand. With the mysterious Nyaal at their side, the Unnamed will get to meet all sorts of people on their journey, letting them learn more about the world they live in and the battle they are fighting.</p>
<p>While the update doesn't shake up the story a whole lot, Reign of Sand does bring some improvements that influence the narrative. For starters, the beginning of the game has been tweaked a bit to get the player faster into the actual adventure, which is a very welcome change, given how the first few minutes were probably the dullest part of the campaign. The biggest change, however, is in regard to voice acting. The original male voice for the Unnamed was replaced with much higher quality acting provided by Ben Starr, who rose to fame in the video gaming world by voicing Clive Rosfield, the main character of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Needless to say, the difference between the old and new voice acting is night and day, presenting dialogues in a more polished way and improving the experience considerably.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the Atlas Fallen gameplay saw mostly an expansion and some tweaking with the Reign of Sand update. The update adds a revamped progression system that makes it easier to enhance the Unnamed, new abilities, and new Essence Stones that grant players even more customization options. Having not played again after having reviewed it last year, I can't tell for sure, but I feel the game's balance has been tweaked as well, and I had far fewer issues achieving high Momentum, unlocking the ultimate form of the main weapons and unleashing the most powerful abilities, in the new version of the game. While these tweaks and quality-of-life improvements are very welcome and make the game slightly more enjoyable than at launch, they fail to address the core issues with the game's combat, which is still clunky and floaty.</p>
<p>The camera, at the very least, has been improved slightly, so it is a little easier to spot and avoid off-screen attacks, but blocking using the Sandskin ability or dodging attacks still doesn't feel as responsive or satisfying as it should have. Again, I find these issues weird for a studio like Deck13, which proved in the past with The Surge series it is more than capable of crafting weighty, satisfying combat. So, if you expect the combat to reach the heights of other games with the update, you will still be disappointed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atlas-Fallen-Reign-of-Sand-02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Rounding up the additions brought to Atlas Fallen by the Reign of Sand update are additional challenges. The long-awaited New Game + comes with Nightmare Mode, putting player skills and builds to the test, while those still in the middle of the adventure will find new combat challenges like the Source and Watcher's Challenges, which task players with defeating enemies under certain conditions, also giving them the chance to take control of Nyaal and use some brand new abilities. Again, welcome additions, especially considering similar content is usually added via paid DLC but hardly game-changing.</p>
<p>Deck13's commitment to improving Atlas Fallen is commendable, and, for the most part, the Reign of Sand update achieves what it sets out to do, enhancing the game enough to make it a little more worthwhile to players who might have skipped it at launch. Still, the update doesn't address what are, in my opinion, the game's biggest issues, so those who didn't like how the combat felt last year will not change their opinions with the game's updated version.</p>

<p>With welcome improvements, quality of life changes, and new content, Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand enhances the game developed by Deck13. However, the update mainly improves the game's existing strengths and fails to address the core issues with its combat system. As a result, the update delivers only partial improvements, leaving those dissatisfied with the game's floaty and unsatisfying combat still wanting more.</p>

Soon enough you get access to a giant drill , the Grinder — wow, that’s the other half of the title. The Grinder allows you to drill into different surfaces in each level, offering a unique movement mechanic that everything else in <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is built around. While moving through ground with the Grinder you feel like you are shooting through water, and you can pull off thrilling moves like jettisoning yourself out of the ground to make big leaps. When you pick up the basics of movement and get into the rhythm, stringing together jumps and drilling into the ground to pick up speed and rush through levels is an exhilarating feeling that never gets old. At its best times <em>Pepper Grinder</em>’s flow-state movement mechanics evoke the very best platformers.</p><p>The only place <em>Pepper Grinder</em> really puts the brakes on its fun movement-based adventure comes when combat becomes a heavier focus. There are boss fights sprinkled in and your average grunt enemy to take down across stages but combat isn’t nearly as thought out or satisfying as speeding through levels. However, the best additions to <em>Pepper Grinder</em> come in its later stages, where the levels amp up just enough to keep offering a new challenge. Once you get into the game’s excellent movement you’ll find yourself rushing through levels as fast as possible until suddenly the game is over.</p><hr><p><em>Pepper Grinder</em> is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover release date, as well as unmasking the killer and survivor you can expect to play as when it arrives.</p>
<p>Originally revealed as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">eighth anniversary celebrations</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive on August 27th, but you can check it out right now via the game's public test branch if you want to.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the killer being added to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as part of the&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover is none other than Dracula, and he brings with him the ability to shapeshift into three different forms with distinct abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-dracula.jpg?itok=rh1ec8Qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-dracula.jpg?itok=rnHqvc3K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dracula is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>-themed killer.</figcaption></figure><p>Dracula's Vampire form can use a damaging fire spell, while his Wolf form is capable of tracking enemies more effectively and moving more swiftly. He can also transform into a bat, giving him the Undetectable status and giving him the ability to teleport to vault points within 32 meters.</p>
<p>His survivor counterpart is none other than vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, scion of the Belmont clan and star of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>show (although not its newest spinoff, <i>Nocturne</i>, which stars Richter Belmont instead).</p>
<p>Trevor's perks allow him to see the killer when completing a generator, upgrade his items, and heal after opening chests, so he's a good choice if you're looking for a scrappy survivor who can fend for themselves.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Castlevania&nbsp;</em>trailer, which gives a glimpse of both Dracula and Trevor, right here.</p>

<p><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a long string of crossovers for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover"><em>Tomb Raider</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the recently-announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>, although that's not coming for a while yet.</p>
<p><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives for all players on August 27th. You can check out the full patch notes for the corresponding update <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/465" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

As the wait lengthens for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deviator">Deviator</a> last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perennial-order">Perennial Order</a>. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.</p>
<p>In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

The last boss rusher I seriously got into was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a> from The Game Bakers. This looks considerably less joyful, assuming you don't find joy in squirming egg sacs or nodachi-wielding toadstools. I will admit to deriving pleasure from the spectacle of a giant skeleton boss who plays chess with squelchy animate pieces, but only because I'd much rather fight a bony boardgamer than the bright-eyed, tentacle-nosed clot of darkness that pursues you elsewhere in the trailer. There are touches of bullet hell, too, albeit with roaches rather than bullets.
</p>
<p>
The developers cite Dark Souls as an influence, but don't expect nearly as much backtracking. Perennial Order lets you respawn right at the beginning of each encounter, so as to "spend your time fighting rather than walking". That said, there's apparently a world beyond the bosses, with NPCs to pester and lore to sponge from secluded nooks. More "boss rush focussed" than "boss rush", perhaps. You can get help from a friend, too: there's optional co-op throughout.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's out 6th September. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1411020/Perennial_Order/">a demo on Steam</a>, if you can't wait to sink your boot into this belching swamp of genre references.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/generative-ai-tools-have-created-a-clusterfuck-but-do-they-have-a-creative-future-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"2024 was a pretty fucked up year in games so can I get a 'fuck that shit' on the count of three," says Good Afternoon co-founder and executive producer, Sarah Brin, opening an electric slalom of Hyper Talks at AMAZE Sheffield. Those in attendance duly oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin briefly took the podium (Hyper Talk speakers only have five minutes to blitz through a topic) to discuss why AI has contributed to the "clusterfuck" that has become the video game industry. She suggests the technology itself isn't the problem, but rather the "overhyped expectations" that have convinced studio heads it can replace human creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"First of all, I want to talk to you a little bit about creativity–and creativity, just in case you didn't know, isn't something you're born with or not," says Brin. "Creativity doesn't just mean being good at art. It's a whole set of holistic skills that I do not have time to unpack for you, so I want to talk about once core concept, and that's the concept of theft."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin is specifically referring to the concept of theft as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/11/good-theft-vs-bad-theft/">described by artist and writer Austin Kleon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who explains that while "imitation is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;flattery. It’s&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>transformation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that is flattery: taking what you’ve stolen and turning it into something&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>new."</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"He explains that part of finding your voice as a creative is about borrowing and sampling and copying the people you really admire. As he outlines here's there's good stuff: honor, study, steal from many," Brin says. "[Then there's] bad theft: not giving credit, plagiarising, and ripping off. When it comes to AI, it's an example of bad theft. At least as it stands now, because there's no way of giving credit."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Offering up some evidence, Brin displays the work of D&amp;D artist Greg Rutkowski, whose work has been copied more than Picasso through AI tools like Midjourney without him ever receiving a credit (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-66099850">more on that here from BBC News</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because of the way the [Midjourney] LLM is set up there's no way to give Rutkowski credit or monetary reimbursement for the work that's been fed into the model. So where does that leave the artist and game developers?," she asks</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would say that many entry-level positions in the game industry as well as those higher up are at risk because of cost-cutting measures. So what do we do? First of all we need to start being responsible about how we put together datasets. We need more mechanisms for attribution. So, the question I want to pose to you today, rather than 'can AI replace human creativity?,' is can AI create with humans in interesting ways as part of the creative process–not a replacement for it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting a little bit philosophical, Brin leans on a theory of play that that emphasises a "dialogue between audience and content," and says we should emulate that dialogue when considering how to combine creative production, AI, and games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Creativity is interplay between humans and their tools, but we have to protect people and workers. We want to build a strong thriving economy in which we can enjoy the work we love to do but also not live in a robotic dystopia," she continues. "How do we protect and promote human creativity? We organize."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin is referencing the ongoing efforts of unions across a number of industries that are working to secure AI protections, preventing major companies from deploying the technology in unethical, debilitating ways. SAG–AFTRA's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-performers-to-hold-first-strike-picket-outside-wb-games">recent decision to strike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a bid to protect video game performers from AI tools is just one instance of how that collective power can manifest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our activism and protecting our creative practice and our craft [isn't just about what] we do in here together as a community. We actually need to get out there and push for legislation and policy recommendations to protect our economic and social futures," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Brin, it's on workers to "move the needle" as a collective and deliver the protections creative industries are crying out for. "If you're not already familiar or are part of a union, please join one." She closes by demanding a rousing "hell yeah" in favor of a better, brighter future for creativity in games. The roof, quite naturally, comes off.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

			<p>A Quiet Place is known for being a great horror franchise, with the premise revolving around staying as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the attention of Death Angels. The movie franchise is getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-a-single-player-horror-game-out-in-2024-made-by-stormind-games/">new addition</a>, but this time it's in the gaming sphere. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead launches 17 October.</p>
<p>This upcoming title is being developed by the Italian developer Stormind Games, the creators of games such as Batora: Lost Haven and the Remothered franchise. The game is being published by Saber Interactive, the publishers for games such as Vampyr, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Kingdom Come: Deliverance.</p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riegOv5eRuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 second trailer</a> has been released on YouTube, showcasing some of the survival horror elements that players can expect to run into. From doors slamming shut and alerting the Death Angels, to having to try and shuffle away from them as they are on high alert searching for you, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead looks like it'll be the perfect game for those who were fans of Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a spin-off from the movie franchise, where you play as a character who has asthma, which, just by using the inhaler is enough to alert the Death Angels to her presence. She is going through interpersonal family conflict, and must deal with her emotions of that while navigating an apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>For those that haven't seen the movies, the Death Angels use sound to locate their prey, and have a heightened sense of hearing, meaning they can hear every little noise you make. In this survival horror game, that may be the thing that makes or breaks her survival.</p>
<p>If you are interested in purchasing A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the game will be released on October 17 and will cost $29.99. Pre-orders for the game are currently available, which will allow those who have pre-ordered to get exclusive content in the game and get their hands on some digital art from the upcoming video game.</p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, the developers also released a 10-minute game play video in July, a video that is exclusive to IGN. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-10-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, you get to see the protagonist navigate Northwood Hospital, where she has to overcome her own fears in order to survive the horrors of the post-apocalyptic world she has been plunged into.</p>

<p>Descenders Next will feature a variety of different sports, adding both snowboarding and mountain boarding. Today’s new video showcased early alpha footage of both. Each additional sport will come with its own biome. </p>



<p>Descenders Next will introduce even more sports “as free updates.” The maps for each biome will feature larger maps, races, challenges, and some “boss jumps.” Procedurally generated nodes will also changed based on timelines rather than player entry.</p>

<p>Today’s reveal trailer also confirms that multiplayer will be available at launch, and players can group up in lobbies. However, solo will still be available anytime. </p>



<p>The trailer also teases Career and Parks modes merging, customization, and other central features.</p>



<p>No More Robots added that “we’ll be running test sessions in the coming months,” so players can sign up now. However, Descenders Next will also appear as a playable game at this year’s Gamescom, ahead of its 2025 launch.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the original Descenders game also has a new update, which is coming to consoles soon. There will also be more updates on Descenders Next via Discord “on a weekly basis.” </p>



<p>No More Games only confirmed PC and Xbox platforms for Descenders Next in today’s trailer. It also teases the Xbox Game Pass, hinting it may join on day one. The original Descenders did join the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-xbox-game-pass-core-game-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass core tier</a> in 2023.</p>

It will be available via the Steam public test build on August 6. <span id="more-903831"></span></p><p>“We wanted to create a fluidity in the way players can have Dracula change between his different forms and have it feel seamless,” said Dead by Daylight creative director Dave Richard in a press release. “When I first played <em>Symphony of the Night</em>—which is one of my favorite games of all time—having vampiric powers like these was absolutely amazing. Being able to put players in the shoes of The Dark Lord in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> was an alluring and unique opportunity for us.”</p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>An Immortal Franchise</strong></p><p>It’s difficult to think back to a time in gaming without Castlevania, one of the most iconic series from <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,073 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami Digital Entertainment</a>‘s (Konami). First released in 1986 on the Famicom Disk System in Japan, then on the <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,558 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System in 1987 and going strong ever since, the <em>Castlevania</em> franchise boasts a legacy almost as enduring as that of its main villain.</p><p>For many—those on the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> team included—the original <em>Castlevania</em> in all its 8-bit glory represented an early introduction to <a title="Genres > Horror [447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> gaming. Countless titles, a hit animated series, and decades of intricate lore later, <em>Castlevania</em> continues to ascend the pantheon of horror with its arrival in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dracula’s powers and those of his castle are inextricably linked, and The Entity has brought both into its realm. Any time Dracula is the featured Killer in a Trial with an Original Map, players will see the ominous castle looming over the proceedings, perched on the horizon of that Map. The powers it bestows upon its master are enough to make even the most grizzled Survivor’s blood run cold.</p><p><strong>Deadly as the Wolf. Swift as the Bat.</strong></p><p>With Castlevania’s Dracula, Dead by Daylight welcomes both its first shapeshifting Killer, as well as its first vampire to The Fog. Regal, imposing, and wholly terrifying, Dracula’s disdain for humankind is matched only by his bloodlust—making The Entity’s Realm a perfect hunting ground for the nightwalker.</p><p>It is said the Dark Lord can take many forms, each one proficient in tracking and killing victims. As a Vampire he stalks his prey, able to conjure flames that sear flesh and render bone to ash. The Bat is as quiet as a creeping shadow, approaching at a moment’s notice and gaining ground with a blink. The Wolf is a relentless hunter, with a keen nose for fresh blood—even that which has yet to be spilled…</p><p><strong>Survivor’s Bloodline</strong></p><p>Tormented, exiled, and even cursed some say, the Belmont bloodline has stood between humanity and the forces of darkness for countless generations. Yet perhaps, no descendant of this clan is better equipped to take on The Entity’s Realm than new Survivor, Trevor Belmont.</p><p>First introduced in 1989’s <em>Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</em>, Trevor may not be the brawniest Belmont, but his unique skillset serves to set him apart. From an innate ability to seek out allies and work as part of a team, to his unmatched skills as a vampire hunter, his values and will exemplify what makes the Belmont clan who they are.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dead by Daylight</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,775 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,013 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,745 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dead-by-daylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dead-by-daylight-windows/9nms4sfnbgbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Castlevania</em> Chapter Official Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Castlevania | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQWEWR4V-m0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It'll likely make a great addition to bookshelves too, as its colorful, abstract cover is a gorgeous piece of artwork. Absolution is the longest novel in the Southern Reach series by nearly 100 pages.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                                                                                          <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.tkqlhce.com\/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/books\/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books">Jeff VanderMeer's Weird Worlds Humble Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.tkqlhce.com\/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/books\/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/jeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books">Get 11 books for only $18</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fjeff-vandermeers-weird-worlds-southern-reach-series-and-other-works-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fjeff-vandermeer-absolution-southern-reach-annihilation-preorder-guide%2F1100-6525451%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff VanderMeer Humble Bundle</a> supports a great charitable cause and comes with 11 books for $18.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-promises-marriage-new-biomes-and-more.945903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fields-of-mistria-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NPC Studio has released the first&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>roadmap, showing off what you can expect from the nostalgic pixel-art life sim as it undergoes its Early Access journey.</p>
<p><em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>was only released in Early Access yesterday, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2142790/view/4373643059887209361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam post</a>, developer NPC Studio shows it's not resting on its laurels and that there's plenty of content coming to the farming sim in the future.</p>
<p>There's already around 35-40 hours to enjoy in the game, according to NPC Studio, but&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>'s first update is already scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024, although its exact date has yet to be determined.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-first-update.jpg?itok=nyKCyOox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-first-update.jpg?itok=ghNzTe4X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>update is due to arrive later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's first update will raise the NPC heart progression cap and add new NPC dialogue, and it'll also bring new enemies and cosmetic loot for the monsters in the mines and dungeon.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new renown rewards and board requests in town, as well as a raised skill cap level, new perks, and new upgrades for your home, plus more. All of that is coming to the game in its first update.</p>
<p>In the future, NPC Studio says it wants to further raise the heart cap and add new events for romanceable NPCs, and that new mine and dungeon biomes, perks, and home upgrades are also on the way later down the line.</p>
<p>As if all of that wasn't enough, you'll also be able to ride large animals and keep pets, so if you're an animal lover, just hold on a little longer and all of your dreams could potentially come true.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>, it's a bright, nostalgic pixel art-based life and farming sim with an anime-inspired aesthetic. It's a deliberate homage to the farming sim-style RPGs of the 90s and beyond, so expect shades of&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>(now&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory</em>, and more.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Fall Guys Crossover Brings Wacky Fun to Battle Royale and More]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-brings-wacky-fun-to-battle-royale-and-more.945900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the chaotic jellybeans into the battle royale game's world via a brand new obstacle course and the chance to make&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed maps in Creative mode.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Where We Fallin' event sees a new&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed obstacle course appearing in the skies over the game's map. To access it, you'll have to find a golden Bean Idol, several of which are "hidden" in the Classy Courts area.</p>
<p>Once you've found one, you'll be transported to the&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>obstacle course. Completing it in time will give you the chance to earn Locker items like a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>jellybean plushie. Awww.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-jellybean-plushie.jpg?itok=XUPZOPT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-jellybean-plushie.jpg?itok=lAxXFqGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could have one of these for your very own.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, it wouldn't be much of an obstacle course if your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character didn't morph into a cute little jellybean, and certain outfits, like Brite Bomber and Jonesy the Secondst, will even have their own custom jellybeans. Sadly, if you're not an original&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you'll just be a default bean.</p>
<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, you can now also <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/create-fall-guys-islands-in-fortnite-with-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create and publish</a> your very own&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed islands in Creative mode and UEFN using "a massive selection of&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>obstacles and props".</p>
<p>To kickstart your creativity,&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developer Mediatonic has made three of its own maps, which you can play with the following codes.</p>
<ul><li>Falling Up: 4185-8103-4745</li>
<li>Tumble Towers: 1985-3300-5865</li>
<li>Blunderdome Blast: 7671-9041-8194</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, three extra&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed stages have been created by Mediatonic in conjunction with Studio 568 and Spiral House, and the codes for those are as follows.</p>
<ul><li>Hex-A-Gone Unlimited: 2214-7960-2047</li>
<li>Bean Circuit: 0057-3389-4313</li>
<li>Pegwin Pickup: 7485-7322-4774</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>' appearance in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>makes a certain degree of sense considering that Mediatonic was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-developer-mediatonic-acquired-by-epic-games">acquired by Epic Games back in 2021</a>, but it's far from the only crossover to be featured in the phenomenally popular battle royale game.</p>
<p>Other properties to have made the jump include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024"><em>Star Wars</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-fortnite-my-hero-academia-crossover"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover"><em>Futurama</em></a>, plus many, many more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s penchant for crossovers is also arguably the reason for the existence of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early"><em>Minecraft</em>-style survival-crafting experience</a>&nbsp;that recently <a href="https://x.com/LEGOFortnite/status/1820763375757893718" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got an update adding fast travel</a>&nbsp;to its massive blocky world.</p>

            <p>Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings III</a> is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Simply put, you’ll be able to create a custom "Landless Adventurer" character at the start of a campaign, just like designing a normal ruler (you might also find yourself landless mid-game following some classic political turmoil). At this point, you'll be expected to play the game a little differently than normal. </p>
<p>"Crusader Kings is a game about marriage, inheritance, and complex realm politics; none of which really apply to wandering characters with nary a vassal to call their own," say Paradox in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-151-landless-adventurers-part-i.1697815/">a lengthy developer diary</a>. "Well, simply put, we think of [adventurers] as the ultimate underdogs: outsiders with no land or prospects, but also no responsibilities or restrictions...</p>
<p>"We wanted to reflect this philosophy with a play style focused on travel and roaming, encouraging you to experience the map in a different way by moving across and spectating it — occasionally stopping to influence this realm or that when you have to proverbially sing for your supper."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That travel takes the form of making camp. You pick a region and set up camp there, at which point you'll be offered "contracts" - various odd jobs that range in difficulty and payout. Some contracts will see you help out in a war (provided you have the soldiers trailing along with you). Others might have you assisting the local ruler's councillors in some scheme or plot, or collecting taxes from reluctant locals, or educating a noble's child. </p>
<p>"Some require no travel, some require you to travel the length of the map, while others might involve a small tour of a character’s realm," say the developers. "Naturally, a core part of this is servicing the fantasy of forming a strong, mobile mercenary army, but we also didn’t want players to be restricted to just this. For every Roger de Flor, there’s an Ibn Battuta or a Marco Polo, after all."</p>
<p>Having read Ibn Battuta's travels, I love this idea. I, too, want to upset a despotic Sultan in India. I, too, wish to be mugged on the road an inconceivable number of times. (The developers say that the "travel safety mechanics" will be the same as those introduced in previous expansion Tours &amp; Tournaments.) To generate new contracts, you'll have to stay on the move, hopping from one de jure region to another in search of the next gig. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"If you complete a contract to your employer’s satisfaction, you’ll receive resources like gold, prestige, sometimes piety, and the new Adventurer-specific provisions... Prestige is needed to advance your fame, which both governs the tier of rulers who’ll offer you contracts (kings and emperors won’t hand them out to just anybody)."</p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it feels a lot like the mercenary wandering of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade</a> games, throwing your lot in with a distant duke before upping sticks to go charm the neighbouring Khan's daughter. Just like those games, you'll also need to keep a healthy stack of food and supplies (those "provisions" mentioned above). If you start running low, followers will start to lose their opinion of you, and starvation will eventually kick in. But it may not come to that. You may become a prestigious wanderer, prompting the chance to earn yourself a landed title.</p>
<p>"Landing yourself should be possible (especially if you’re willing to take the indignity of an impoverished, remote county somewhere), but not something you can do with a click of your fingers and no prep work," say the devs.</p>
<p>"We do expect some players to want to be adventurers for as little time as possible, and others to want to be them for centuries at a time. Off-ramps are provided at various stages for players who decide they want to leave the life of an Adventurer. It’s up to you if you’d be happy taking a back-water county somewhere in exchange for a huge sum of cash, building an army to try retaking your throne, or simply drift around the world making your mark in a half a dozen small ways."</p>
<p>The post shares an example of exactly that, detailing a playthrough featuring a landless Kashmiri schemer called Shirin who "longs to explore far from home". It's worth a read if you still want finer details of how certain contract types will play out (a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDl-F0OYOP8">video version is also available</a>). At one point, she takes a transport contract, meaning to escort a Baron westwards, only to discover that Persia is in the midst of the Iranian Intermezzo, a huge and prolonged struggle that probably will not clear up by tomorrow. </p>

<p>"Along the way," the dev explains, "danger events bedevil us, [my follower] Lalit manages to lose some provisions and get beaten up in a tavern fight, and I caught typhus."</p>
<p>Yes. YES. This is exactly the kind of stuff I long for in a CKIII game. Travel! Excitement! Accidentally dropping all your food into a puddle of excrement at the side of the road! </p>
<p>There are a bunch of other contract types, including ones based on intrigue and stewardship. But there are also jobs allowing for criminal actions like arson, murder or robbery, essentially making you a travelling bandit. At some point you'll be able to "wipe the slate" clean with a donation of gold and prestige, should you want to clean up and go straight again.</p>
<p>There are a lot more differences in playstyle when compared to a landed noble. Skill trees will be different, for example, and the grandiose feasts and weddings of the gentry are replaced with campfire revelries. You'll also have to invest in camp upgrades, in order to unlock other traditionally available features. Like creating a portable shrine to allow for converting religions. And, perhaps most importantly, succession becomes far more "informal" and simple: your oldest child or closest relative will take the lead. Failing that, whatever follower in the camp has the highest "prowess". </p>

</figure>
<p>"Adventurers don’t really experience succession politics in the same way that even the smallest realm does," the developer explains. "There are no laws binding them save their own will, and comparatively little to be divided or fought over anyway..." </p>
<p>The post goes deeper into the mechanics and says more details will be covered in a later dev diary. Considering the length of this post alone, I'm excitedly afraid of what constitutes the "individual nuts and bolts" yet to be discussed. But that's Crusader Kings' simulation for you. Why be merely complex, when you can be a ferociously intricate labyrinth of tiny cogs?</p>
<p>All in all, it's getting me excited for CKIII in a way I haven't been for a while. And it's not even the flagship feature of the Roads To Power DLC (that's all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-is-getting-two-new-expansions-in-2024">Byzantine stuff</a>). Adventurers previously existed in CKII, but mostly as pesky randos who would show up in your country with an army and a shit-eating grin. Here, players will actually be let loose into the chaos of CKIII's fully simulated nonsense, without any of the trappings of the nobility. I hope it'll be as disastrously good as it looks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Developer RageSquid has unveiled Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to  2018's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, which is aiming to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need" when it comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a> and Game Pass sometime in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The original Descenders was all about exhilarating mountain biking across a procedurally generated world. Descenders Next, though, is doing something a little bit different, expanding its scope to include as many extreme sports as it possibly can over the coming years.
</p>
<p>
As per its reveal announcement, RageSquid's goal with Descenders Next is to capture the "same feel, the same sense speed" as its predecessor, but across numerous disciplines, beginning with boarding sports on release.

<p>
"Players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding action," the studio explains, "before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport will feel and handle completely different to the others, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of Next."
</p>
<p>
All this plays out across procedural off-piste mountains chaining into "tight, winding parks and vistas", where players can attempt speed challenges, trick-focused challenges, even scavenger hunts. There's talk of "multiple huge biomes", as well as full multiplayer support, and players can earn rep used to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles, and more as they play. RageSquid even promises a "banging" soundtrack form Monstercat.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Descenders Next's release in 2025, RageSquid will be running a number of online Test Sessions later this year, and interested parties can sign up via the game's website.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/abathor-volgarr-viking-barbarian-games-retro-1851614316<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a time of legend long past, when video games were still emerging from the primordial mists and magic still flowed through all things, there were games of ultimate power. These games didn’t concern themselves with Italian plumbers or sad surrogate dads, but with fierce warriors who shirtlessly strode into battle, their muscles on glorious display, to cut down their foes with swords and prove themselves the strongest and manliest of all. I speak, of course, of barbarians. And though, in recent decades, games focused entirely on the heroic exploits of barbarians have been few and far between, we now find ourselves in the midst of a mini-renaissance of barbarian games! To quote the 1982 film <em>Conan the Barbarian</em>, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Oo9buo9Mtos?si=ct8qc-L71YoFr2vb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Oo9buo9Mtos?si=ct8qc-L71YoFr2vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That is good.

Then, of course, there’s <em>Barbarian </em>for the Amiga, a fighting game that made a friend and I laugh endlessly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C4Ii_YfJNvw?si=ayzcLHjJVSuivLFu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C4Ii_YfJNvw?si=ayzcLHjJVSuivLFu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we cut each other’s heads off again and again</a></span>. (Here in the U.S. this one was called <em>Death Sword </em>but it will always be <em>Barbarian </em>to me.) If I list every barbarian game of the era, I’ll be here all day, but other notable ones include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoI9NH5GlQw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoI9NH5GlQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sword of Sodan</em></a></span><em> </em>(avoid the Genesis version at all costs) and perhaps the most legendary of them all, <em>Rastan</em>, Taito’s tough-as-nails 1987 arcade game with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and a barbarian hero to rival the likes of Conan himself. Behold it here in all its glory.<br></p><p><br>In addition to being arguably the most famous barbarian game of the 1980s, <em>Rastan </em>is also the one whose influence on the two brand-new barbarian games that are giving the genre a mini-renaissance is most clear. First of all, there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jandusoft.com/abathor/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jandusoft.com/abathor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Abathor</em></a></span>, a side-scrolling action game available on every current platform. <em>Abathor </em>lets you and up to three friends embark on an epic hack-and-slash quest across dozens of stages, and while at first things may feel a bit easy and ordinary, rest assured that as you progress, the intensity ratchets up mightily. Thus far I’ve made it to the game’s fourth zone, and I’m really impressed by how it’s now starting to throw constant surprises at me, all manner of new perils and new situations that are keeping me on my toes. If anything, I’d urge you NOT to watch the trailer below, because I think it’s better to discover what the game has to offer yourself. However, if you want a peek at the game’s gorgeous pixel art and old-school gameplay, look no further. <em>Abathor </em>is definitely a worthy successor to the barbarian games of old.<br></p><p>And then there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/volgarr2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/volgarr2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Volgarr the Viking II</em></a></span>. Now look, <em>Abathor </em>ain’t exactly a walk in the park, but <em>Volgarr II</em>, like its 2013 predecessor, leans into the difficulty of the 1980s games that inspired it—<em>hard</em>. Volgarr may be a muscular viking warrior but he still dies in one hit by default, and playing it, you <em>will </em>die, <em>a lot. </em>This is the kind of game that demands that you study, memorize, and master it, remembering where enemies spawn and how they behave so that you know how to tackle them and ultimately emerge from the level triumphant. Maybe that sounds like a chore to you, but let me tell you, my time with <em>Volgarr II </em>has reminded me just how immensely rewarding games with this kind of difficulty can be.<br></p><p>I can see myself in real-time figuring out how to navigate the challenges it puts before me, and developing that kind of mastery is immensely satisfying. Also, if you played the original ten years ago and decided it wasn’t for you, don’t write off this sequel just yet. In every way that counts, it’s just as challenging as its predecessor, but it also gives you a few more tools that just might give you the encouragement and support you need to succeed—things like mid-level checkpoints and one helpful feature I refuse to spoil, it’s so twisted and inventive. I still have a long way to go in <em>Volgarr II</em>, but I know it offers the kind of satisfaction I’ve rarely experienced from a game since the likes of <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>and <em>Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts </em>were commonplace. Like <em>Abathor</em>, you can now find <em>Volgarr II </em>on pretty much every platform that still gets new video games.<br></p><p>Okay, so two games may not seem like a lot, but for a subgenre that has seen so little activity in so long—specifically tough, side-scrolling hack-and-slash action games about barbarians—two great entries landing at right around the same time feels like a veritable feast of riches. For people like me who’ve been longing for a return to the glory days of <em>Rastan</em>, feast well, my friends. Valhalla awaits. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The part of the announcement that’s going over less well is the remaster’s retail price tag: $45. Some fans seem to think that’s the price of the digital version, but my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading of the announcement</a></span> from producer Yoshimi Yasuda is that it’s for the physical editions, which often tend to be slightly higher for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://limitedrungames.com/products/ps5-limited-run-111-lollipop-chainsaw-repop&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/ps5-limited-run-111-lollipop-chainsaw-repop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limited runs</a></span>. </p><p>Even at $40, however, the price strikes some as a little high considering <em>RePOP</em> is a remaster rather than a remake, and that it’s seemingly missing the original’s licensed soundtrack, which included Skrillex, Dragonforce, Sleigh Bells, and many others. Another Grasshopper Manufacturer game, <em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, came out a year before <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> and its recent remaster is only $25. </p><p>The <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> remaster was originally going to be a full-blown remake, but the company behind it said it was walking that back <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gematsu.com/2023/10/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-game-design-changed-from-remake-to-remaster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/10/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-game-design-changed-from-remake-to-remaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at the request of fans</a></span>. While the original game was co-written by James Gunn and co-directed by Suda51, neither are involved in the remaster at all, leaving some fans worried about how faithful it will be to the feel and spirit of the 2012 version. </p><p>To deal with that skepticism, Yasuda keeps promising fans an “uncensored” version of the game’s outfits, a seeming nod to the recent obsessions with sexy outfits in <em>Stellar Blade</em>. It’s not entirely clear if he’s being facetious or trying to capitalize on that movement to juice sales. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
