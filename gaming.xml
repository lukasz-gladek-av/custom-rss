<p>If you can believe it, it has been almost a year since the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sid_meiers_civilization_vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>. To mark the occasion, Firaxis Games Creative Director Ed Beach has shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYry-kvC8u4">special anniversary message</a>, outlining what's next for the game and teeing up today's brand-new update.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.3.2 patch is rolling out today, adding a new peppering of 'nestled tooltips' to help get your head around complex in-game terms on the fly, a lens to make locating high-Happiness tiles a bit easier, and a handful of balancing tweaks for the French Empire and Dai Viet. It also reintroduces fan-favourite ally Gilgamesh back into the leader roster, complete with a free anniversary profile badge, banner, and title.</p>
<p>Beach also shared some details on the upcoming massive 'Test of Time' update, which the team plans to launch this Spring. This update — described as "similar in scope to an expansion in terms of gameplay systems and functionality" — will introduce the option to play as one civ through all ages, reworks how Victories are achieved, and introduces a new 'Triumph' system to replace Legacy Paths. We're sure we'll hear more about this one in the coming months, but you can read a detailed rundown of everything we know so far about the Test of Time update on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/anniversary/">Civ VII website</a>.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to <em>today's</em> update. The full patch notes were shared in a recent <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">Civ VII blog post</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below. Be warned, it's quite a long one!</p>
<h2>Sid Meier's Civilization VII Ver. 1.3.2 (3rd Feb 2026)</h2>
<h3><strong>Gilgamesh Returns</strong></h3>
<p>Your best friend and King of Uruk, Gilgamesh, makes his comeback to <em>Civilization</em>! This leader is free for all <em>Civ VII</em> players with the 1.3.2 Update as a thank you for all the support we’ve seen from players over the last year, along with a free anniversary profile badge, banner, and title.</p>
<p>Whether he was your favorite ally in <em>Civ VI</em> or if you've never met the legendary demigod of Uruk face-to-face, Gilgamesh is best known for his prowess in battle. In <em>Civ VII</em>, his emphasis on Endeavors helps him maximize their value with Allies. If you're playing as Gilgamesh, make sure you form those alliances quickly, and if you're not, becoming his Ally first may benefit you greatly.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh is most effective when he invests in befriending one primary Ally. Not only does entering a war while having exactly one Ally garner him additional War Support, but his Mementos reward this one-Ally approach as well. Check out his kit below!</p>
<dl><dt>Attributes</dt><dd>Diplomatic, Militaristic</dd><dt>Unique Ability - Once Mortal, Twice Divine</dt><dd>Gain War Support when you have exactly one Ally. When you defeat an enemy Unit, gain Influence equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength. All basic Endeavors are unlocked; Endeavors with Allies don’t count against the limit of having one Endeavor of a given type active at a time. Allies can support your Endeavors for free.</dd><dt>Agenda - Ally of Enkidu</dt><dd>Increase Relationship by a Medium Amount with leaders who have started or supported the most Endeavors. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with leaders in Alliances with others.</dd></dl>
<h3><strong>Nested Tooltips</strong></h3>
<p>With Update 1.3.2, we’re adding the first pass of a new feature we’re very excited about: nested tooltips. Nested tooltips are an upgrade to our current tooltips, allowing them to turn game terms into links that provide further information when inspected.</p>
<p><em>Civ VII</em> is a deep game with lots of concepts that are new to the series, like Warehouse bonuses, and concepts that have been around a long time which we often take for granted, like Wonders. With this update, we’re upgrading our tooltips so that concepts like Warehouses or Wonders can be inspected to get a new tooltip with a brief explanation of that concept. There’s still more detailed information to be found in the Civilopedia, but these brief explainers are easier to access in the moment when you need a quick introduction or refresher on what exactly something does. Being able to nest information helps us make our tooltips more concise, and we’ve taken advantage of this opportunity to graphically refresh the affected tooltips. These two changes together should make the tooltips more readable, and thus the game more understandable. We know that the game is more fun when it helps you understand things better, as we saw with the Production List changes in 1.2.5, and we’re committed to continue improving the UI to better support that.</p>
<p>This feature is something we’re still actively working on, but we want to get the first iteration of it into your hands right away so you can let us know how it feels. Unsurprisingly, <em>Civ</em> games have a lot of text, so we’re doing this in phases. For 1.3.2, we’ve focused on populating the Tech and Civic choosers as well as the Production List tooltips first, because those are places where having more information as you make those big decisions is the most helpful.</p>
<p>We’re aiming to strike the right balance between providing useful information while not inundating the player to the point where it detracts from understanding. Do you think we struck the right balance? Let us know! Also, please let us know which areas of the game you’d find it most useful for us to focus on next. For example, we’re experimenting with automatically locking a tooltip if it’s been open for a few seconds, and letting players configure that timing.</p>
<h3><strong>New Appeal Lens</strong></h3>
<p>As we continue to evaluate Happiness and set the foundation for bigger upcoming changes, we’re working to ensure players always have the information they need to read the game. With this update, we’re presenting a new Appeal Lens. This new strategic tool is designed to help you quickly identify which tiles are Breathtaking or Charming, and even help you spot Natural Wonders.</p>
<p>Along with this new tool in <em>your</em> toolbelt, we’ve added a new one to ours. Previously, tiles could either be Appealing or not. Appealing tiles provided Happiness, and the Yield for Happiness scaled by Age. Now, Appealing tiles come in two types: <strong>Charming</strong> and <strong>Breathtaking</strong>. Charming tiles provide base Happiness, while Breathtaking tiles provide increased Happiness, and this value no longer scales by Age.</p>
<p>We hope you use the Appeal Lens to help answer these questions throughout your empire-building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will I get the Happiness I need to support the Specialists and Buildings in my growing Cities?</li>
<li>Do I want to prioritize expansion towards high-value Natural Wonders?</li>
<li>Do I want to earn extra Happiness to trigger more Celebrations quickly?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Coastal Raid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coastal Raid action for Naval Units has been updated to behave more like the Pillage action.
<ul>
<li>Naval Units can still Coastal Raid the tile they are on, as well as adjacent tiles, but they no longer have the option to Pillage. Coastal Raid can still be used to activate discoveries at range and capture Districts.</li>
<li>Coastal Raiding now provides Yields based on the tile being raided, matching Yields gained when Pillaging that tile. (<em>Previously: Coastal Raid defaulted to granting Gold and Health.)</em></li>
<li>Coastal Raid now also benefits from abilities that increase Pillage Yields. Effects that are intended to only trigger on Pillaging on land will specify Land Units in their description.</li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> We made this change to reduce the redundancy and confusion when Naval Units had access to both Coastal Raid and Pillage. We also took this opportunity to refine how the two actions really worked!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To support this change, the following content was updated:
<ul>
<li>Iceland’s Dróttkvætt Tradition and Vikingr were updated.
<dl><dt>Dróttkvætt</dt><dd>Naval Units grant Culture equal to 50% of Pillage Yields and Healing. <em>(Previously: Coastal Raiding grants Culture equal to 50% the Gold gained.)</em></dd><dt>Vikingr</dt><dd>Iceland Unique Heavy Naval Unit. Grants Science equal to 25% of Pillage Yields and Healing. Has 3 Sight. <em>(Previously: Iceland Unique Heavy Naval Unit. Coastal Raiding grants Science equal to 25% the Gold gained. Has 3 Sight.)</em></dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Descriptions of Wonders, Social Policies, Commander Promotions, and Civ Abilities were updated to clarify whether they apply to Naval or Land Units.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new Appeal Lens.</li>
<li>Appeal’s effect on Happiness has been updated. The way a tile’s Appeal is calculated is unchanged.
<ul>
<li>Appeal is no longer binary, and now has levels. Tiles can be Average, Charming, or Breathtaking. Appeal level determines how much Happiness a tile provides, and Happiness from Appealing tiles no longer scales by Age.
<ul>
<li><strong>Average</strong> tiles continue to not provide Happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Charming</strong> tiles provide +1 Happiness when improved.</li>
<li><strong>Breathtaking</strong> tiles provide +2 Happiness when improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abilities that previously referred to tiles with a Happiness Yield or a Natural Happiness Yield have been updated to reference Appeal instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI behavior around Diplomacy gameplay has been updated.
<ul>
<li>Diplomatic leaders will more properly use the Military Sabotage Action unlocked in the Diplomatic Attribute tree.</li>
<li>Militaristic leaders will more properly use the Open the Gates Espionage during War, and put more Influence towards War Support.</li>
<li>All leaders befriend Independents slightly more often.</li>
<li>Individual leaders have had specific biases adjusted to better support their gameplay. (Leaders affected include Ben Franklin, Edward Teach, Harriet Tubman, Himiko Queen of Wa, Ibn Battuta, Jose Rizal, Lafayette, Machiavelli, Napoleon Emperor, Sayyida al Hurra, Trung Trac.)</li>
<li>Leaders with City-State centered gameplay more properly Suzerain and Incorporate City-States. (Leaders affected include Lakshmibai, Tecumseh.)</li>
<li>Leaders with Personas have had their personalities slightly differentiated to vary gameplay. (Leaders affected include Ashoka, Friedrich, Himiko, Xerxes.)</li>
<li>Civs have had specific biases adjusted to better support their gameplay. (Civs affected include Greece, Shawnee, Siam, Tonga, Prussia, America, Great Britain, Spain.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diplomacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players will now correctly lose the +1 Gold Effect from Pirate Haven when losing a Trade Route by declaring a War.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed “Rural District" to just “Rural” on various tooltips, effects, descriptions, and Civilopedia articles for better consistency with gameplay logic. These tiles are now simply referred to as “Rural” to avoid confusion with "Districts” or Urban tiles.
<ul>
<li>As part of this change, the effects of both Qajar’s <em>Qullarāqāsi</em> Tradition and Sayyida al Hurra’s leader ability, <em>Hakima Tatwan</em>, now match their descriptions and only apply to Urban Districts.</li>
<li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: We wanted effects like these to be impactful and easily understood, while also not creating odd incentives. As we ramp up to bigger changes, expect us to unify language, make things clearer, and occasionally change abilities such as these to better fit. As always, we will be monitoring balance for Qajar and Sayyida al Hurra and make adjustments when necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players no longer fail to receive +2 Culture from ongoing Diplomatic projects when the Ekklesia Mastery has been completed and a Diplomatic project has been started.</li>
<li>Added Production Adjacency from Wonders for Factories in Modern.</li>
<li><em>Riches of the Duat</em> will no longer provide a +20% production bonus when constructing a Wonder in a city not located in desert terrain.</li>
<li>The bonuses from the "Freyfaxahamar" Storylet are no longer given as a Global Yield when selected. The bonus now correctly applies only towards Settlements that are following the player’s Religion.</li>
<li>The Anjuvannam Unique Building no longer fails to receive Adjacency Bonuses from Coastal tiles when slotting the "Shusei Kokubo" tradition.</li>
<li>Ageless Fortified Districts no longer lose Health and Wall Defense bonus when transitioning to the following Age.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Military</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Communism no longer spawns Naval Ranged Units instead of Land Ranged Units when completed in the Civic Tree.</li>
<li>Naval Units with the Pirate ability are no longer able to be attacked through Fortified districts when targeted by neutral units.</li>
<li>Military Naval Units can now properly capture a Fortified tile when the tile has had all Buildings pillaged.</li>
<li>The Donjon Unique Quarter no longer gives an extra Chevalier Unit when the Normans reconquer a Settlement with a completed Donjon Unique Quarter.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported storylet issue causing Army Commanders to disappear after gaining the reward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved transition VFX for Naval Units.</li>
<li>Addressed a visual issue affecting Shawnee's Unique Unit "Hoceepkileni" model.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Leaders &amp; Civs</strong></h3>
<h4>Leaders</h4>
<ul>
<li>(★ - Community Influence Item) Added new leader Gilgamesh.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Civs</h4>
<p><strong>Mughal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Ability:
<ul>
<li>Paradise of Nations: +100% to all Gold Yields, -25% to all other Yields. (<em>Previously: Paradise of Nations: +75% to all Gold Yields, -25% to all other Yields.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> We’ve been wanting to lean into the asymmetrical nature of the Mughal ability harder and make this a clean 100% bonus for a while, but waited to tweak the whole kit to support this change, as well as get a better sense of how the Modern Age was played by the community. While some abilities technically got debuffed a bit, overall we’ve found this to be a decent boost to making the Mughals feel special.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unique Improvement:
<ul>
<li>Stepwell: +2 Food. +2 Food from adjacent Farms. Must be built on a Flat tile. Cannot be built adjacent to another Stepwell. <em>(Previously: +2 Gold. +2 Food from adjacent Farms. Must be built on a Flat tile. Cannot be built adjacent to another Stepwell.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Since we buffed the Unique Ability to carry the majority of the Gold Bonus, we took the opportunity to focus other parts of their kit on the Food and Rural aspects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traditions:
<ul>
<li>Mayūrāsana: +10% Gold towards purchasing anything. <em>(Previously: +25% Gold towards purchasing anything.)</em></li>
<li>Jins-i Kamil: +1 Food on Farms for each adjacent Plantation, and on Plantations for each adjacent Farm. (<em>Previously: +1 Food and Gold on Farms for each adjacent Plantation, and on Plantations for each adjacent Farm.)</em>
<dl><dt>Dev Note</dt><dd>This is another example of letting this part of the kit guide players to Mughal’s other strengths around Food.</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>Qilachas: +2 Gold on Quarters with Walls. <em>(Previously this ability wasn't working as intended and counted any District with 2 Buildings, instead of Quarters. Quarters are Districts with 2 Ageless or Current-Age Buildings)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Civic Tree:
<ul>
<li>Zabt Tier 1: Unlock the Stepwell. +1 Gold on Farms in Towns. Jins-i Kamil Tradition. (<em>Previously: Unlock the Stepwell. +1 Gold on Farms. Jins-i Kamil Tradition.)</em></li>
<li>Gardens of Paradise Tier 1: You can purchase Wonders with Gold, but they are more expensive. (150%) Mayūrāsana Tradition. (<em>Previously: You can purchase Wonders with Gold. Mayūrāsana Tradition).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dai Viet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Ability
<ul>
<li>Hịch Tướng Sĩ: When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 25 Culture for every Urban Population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed) (<em>Previously: When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 5 Culture for every Urban Population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed)).</em></li>
<li><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Sometimes, we like to just buff stuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unique Settler
<ul>
<li>Quận Vương: Unique Settler. When this Unit Settles receive 25 Culture for every Tropical tile within 3 of the City Center (Scales by Game Speed). (<em>Previously: When this Unit Settles receive 5 Culture for every Tropical tile within 3 of the City Center (Scales by Game Speed)).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>French Empire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced Militaristic Attribute for Cultural.
<dl><dt>Dev Note</dt><dd>The French Empire’s focus on Happiness and Government made the Diplomatic Attribute clear, but the rest of their bonuses split pretty evenly between combat and cultural focuses. With the other changes to their kit with this update, we felt it was appropriate to adjust their Attribute accordingly. As we ramp up towards releasing some bigger changes and making Attributes matter more in some contexts, we might adjust a few more civs in future updates. We plan to be very judicious about these shifts!</dd></dl>
</li>
<li>Changed the Grand Armee combat strength effect from Per Adjacent Unit to Traditions slotted in the Government.</li>
<li>Added a Tradition Slot to the French Empire’s final Civic.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[“That Sucks. What Are We Learning?”: New Report Reveals How Obsidian Looks to Bounce-Back After Two Commercial Misses in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/that-sucks-what-are-we-learning-new-report-reveals-how-obsidian-looks-to-bounce-back-after-two-commercial-misses-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>1424101</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Obsidian Entertainment</strong> was one of the busiest studios in 2025, releasing not just one, but <strong>three major titles</strong> last year. It began the year with <strong>Avowed</strong> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">February 2025</a>, followed by <strong>Grounded 2</strong> releasing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">early access in July 2025</a>, and capped off the year with <strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">October 2025</a>. Two out of those three games were  misfires in terms of sales, and a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy">Bloomberg</a> digs into how the studio is looking to bounce back and "<em>reinvent itself</em>."</p>



<p>If you can't guess which of the two games missed the mark on their sales, it was The Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, though Obsidian Entertainment studio head <strong>Feargus Urquhart</strong> is quick to note that they weren't complete bombs. "<em>They're not disasters. I'm not going to say this was a kick in the teeth</em>," Urquhart said. "<em>It was more like: <strong>'That sucks. What are we learning?</strong>'"</em></p>



<p>One of those takeaways is how long the studio takes on its projects. Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 both took over half a decade to make, and Urquhart (and the rest of the studio, seemingly) wants to cut that time down by half, within reason. When Avowed was initially pitched to Microsoft, it was initially envisioned as a massive, ambitious cross between <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> and <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. As the studio's design director, <strong>Josh Sawyer</strong> put it: "<em>I don't think there's a team on the planet that could execute on this</em>." </p>



<p>Obviously, that's not what Avowed ended up becoming, but by the time the decision was made to do away with the multiplayer portion and assign a new director to the game, it had been in development for <strong>three years</strong>. It took a total of <strong>seven years</strong> to actually get what we know Avowed to be out the door.</p>



<p>Regarding the time spent developing The Outer Worlds 2, which took <strong>six years</strong> between the release of the first game to the release of its sequel, game director <strong>Brandon Adler</strong> said, "<em>I don't think anybody really likes five, six, seven-year dev cycles. We've kind of grown into that</em>."</p>



<p>As for why Grounded 2 was able to come together faster than Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, that came partially from <strong>Eidos Montreal</strong> pitching itself as a support studio for Obsidian. With the help of Eidos, and the distance afforded by not developing the entire thing internally, Obsidian co-founder and one of the game's managing directors, <strong>Chris Parker</strong>, noted that it gave them the grace to make faster decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>I was like, 'If this was one of our internal teams, we would work on this for another two or three months</em>,'" when discussing the decision to abandon making the rideable bugs in Grounded 2 shared by two or more players at once. "<em>We made this call because we could tell them what to do. It feels like we still run around with our kid gloves on internally</em>."</p>



<p>Probably the most damning quote in the report, in terms of how the studio needed to take a hard look at its processes and work towards change, comes from Sawyer. Regarding the fact that Obsidian released three games last year, he said, "<em>Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out. It's not good to release three games in the same year. <strong>It's a result of things going wrong</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>Leaning on support studios seems to be one tactic the studio may use to make faster decisions, but a more reliable tactic will be reusing technology and systems where possible, instead of having to start from scratch all the time. "<em>We don't need to change everything every time</em>," Urquhart said. "<em>We've had this debate internally: Do people really care that we spent an extra hundred person-months on the inventory screen?</em>"</p>



<p>At the same time, Urquhart also noted that when doing a post-mortem on Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed, it can be minor differences that make a huge impact on a game's success. The trouble is figuring out which way those minor details are meant to go. "<em>Our job, all of us here, is to make games that people want to play and buy, and if we continue to do that, then we have a solid business</em>."</p>



<p>Cutting down development times with <strong>more outsourcing</strong> and <strong>reusing technology</strong> where possible are two of the key elements in Obsidian Entertainment's plan for the future. Also included in those plans are the growth of up-and-coming developers, with Urquhart mentoring <strong>Justin Birtch</strong> and <strong>Marcus Morgan</strong> to take his place one day at the studio's helm, and having <strong>multiple, smaller-scale projects on the go at once</strong>, instead of one big project that consumes the entire workforce. </p>

<figcaption>The Switch 2 is doing well, as is <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not only is the Switch 2 selling well, but the system's flagship racer <em>Mario Kart World </em>is racking up numbers for itself, too. Nintendo says the racing game has sold 14.03 million units, although that figure presumably includes bundles that pack the game in with the console as well.</p><p>In general, Nintendo's sales have risen by almost 100% when compared to the same period last year, although you'd expect that given the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released a major console</a> in the months between March and December.</p><p>All of Nintendo's profit figures have risen to varying degrees as well, so all told, it's been a pretty good period for the gaming giant, although once again, that's to be expected given the Switch 2's meteoric rise.</p><p>With regard to other releases, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>has managed to sell over 12 million copies between the Switch 2 and the original Switch, so that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d5d3818-49a2-4447-89bf-e19e298fa0df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another six million or so</a> since the game's initial launch window.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-pushes-hard-with-its-newly-released-action-camera-as-osmo-360-essential-combo-hits-a-record-low-2000665172</link>
            <guid>1424083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The DJI Osmo 360 Camera is designed to help you create high-resolution, immersive content by capturing a full 360-degree image using a 1-inch 360 imaging system that delivers native 8K 360 video and high-quality still images, wrapping every scene into a single frame. The camera also includes a new 180° invisible selfie stick and an extra battery, so you can keep filming creative third-person angles without stopping to swap batteries. The DJI Osmo 360 Camera Essential Combo includes accessories that make it easy for you to shoot spherical footage in multiple formats, including vertical videos for platforms like Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7016/">You can get the DJI Osmo 360 Camera Essential Combo on Amazon for $389, which is $210 off its regular price of $599, or 35% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7016/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A high-quality camera for capturing life’s every moment</h2>
<p>The DJI Osmo 360 Camera uses a larger 1-inch dual-lens sensor to collect more light and deliver improved low-light performance. It natively records 8K 360 video at up to 30 frames per second, allowing you to zoom, reframe, and refocus footage to suit social media platforms and standard widescreen formats. The camera also captures 120-megapixel 360 photos, giving you detailed panoramic images of your surroundings. With 10-bit color and D-Log-M support, you have plenty of flexibility to color grade your 360 footage.</p>
<p>You can choose from a range of motion and framing options to customize how your content looks. You can shoot in 4K at 120 FPS for slow-motion footage or use the 170-degree Boost mode for a wider perspective similar to an ultra-wide lens. The 1.2-meter invisible selfie stick lets you position the camera above or in front of you while remaining hidden during post-production. Quick-release magnetic mounts and a standard ¼-20 threaded thread allow you to switch quickly between helmet mounts, tripods, clamps, or vlog-style single-lens setups.</p>



<p>The camera and included accessories are built for extended use. You get 105 GB of internal storage, letting you record 360-degree footage continuously even without a memory card installed. If you need more space, you can expand storage using the microSD card slot. Depending on your recording settings, you can record for up to 190 minutes, and the extra battery included in the Essential Combo gives you enough power to keep filming after the first battery runs out.</p>
<p>Additional features include audio recording, editing tools, and intuitive controls. Four built-in microphones capture sound from all directions, and when paired with up to two compatible microphone transmitters, OsmoAudio helps keep your audio setup clean and efficient. The DJI Mimo app gives you pano dewarp tools and color grading options for editing your 360 footage. You can also control the camera and transfer files using the built-in touchscreen with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. With the camera, invisible selfie stick, extra battery, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7016/">and the Essential Combo’s discounted $389 price compared to the usual $599, this setup gives you a strong starting point for expanding your content creation library with 360-degree video.</a></p>

              <p><span>Copyright law nearly got in the way of whimsy, as a Spanish figure skater’s planned routine&nbsp; for the 2026 Olympics was in jeopardy. Why? The music his routine uses couldn’t be cleared for the event. The song in question? </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsas-7DcA6Q"><span>“Papaya” by the Minions</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté, a 26-year-old ice skater who has won many a gold medal across his career, has been performing a routine set to the </span><i><span>Minions</span></i><span> song throughout the competitive season leading up to the Winter Olympic Games, which are set to begin on Friday, February 6, in Italy. However, in an </span><a href="https://x.com/InTheLoPodcast/status/2018206034163073309"><span>Instagram story</span></a><span> posted yesterday, Guarino Sabaté revealed that he would not be able to do this routine, which has him dressed in blue overalls and a bright yellow shirt, because Universal Pictures refused to clear the song for the televised event.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“This season I competed with my </span><i><span>Minions</span></i><span> short program to bring joy and a playful style to the ice while still meeting every required element to show that skating as a male Olympic figure skater can be fun,” Guarino Sabaté wrote. “I followed all required procedures and submitted my music through the ISU ClicknClear system back in August, and I competed with this program throughout the entire season. Unfortunately, just days before the Olympic inauguration, I was informed that I am no longer permitted to use this program due to copyright clearance issues.</span></p> <p><span>“Finding this out last Friday, so close to the biggest competition of my life, was incredibly disappointing. Nevertheless, I will face this challenge head-on and do everything I can to make the best of the situation.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A music rights clearance issue means we will all be robbed of seeing this at the Olympics:<br> <a href="https://t.co/tgBhpCG13i">pic.twitter.com/tgBhpCG13i</a> <a href="https://t.co/Hn09Kqmphq">https://t.co/Hn09Kqmphq</a></p> <p>— Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/2018309613095960743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>You can see a short clip from the routine above, and while, yes, there’s some impressive figure-skating athleticism on display here, there are also some silly dance moves in the mix as well. It would have been a shame if a company as big as Universal got in the way of Guarino Sabaté doing this on one of the world’s biggest stages. Luckily, it seems like he’ll be able to perform the short program at the event after an outpouring of public support got the company to reconsider.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Huge THANK YOU to everyone who reposted, shared, and supported,” Guarino Sabaté wrote </span><a href="https://x.com/AnythingGOE/status/2018619222536904730"><span>in a follow-up story</span></a><span>. “Because of you, Universal studios reconsidered and officially granted the rights for this one special occasion. I’m so happy to see that the minions hitting Olympic ice is becoming real again!!”</span></p> <p><span>Bullying works, I suppose. Never thought I’d be hooting and hollering for a piece of obnoxious </span><i><span>Minions</span></i><span> music to appear at the Olympics, but I hate to see big business keeping a whimsical king down. </span></p>

            <guid>1424077</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new statement, the former Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies, has said the allegations in the ‘Epstein Files’ are false. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revelation</a> from a few days ago revealed that Leslie Benzies has been accused of sexual assault, and the current Rockstar president, Sam Houser, was at least aware of the situation. However, Benzies has denied all of the allegations, revealing a different story. </p>







<h2 id="h-ex-rockstar-north-president-states-he-never-visited-epstein-island">Ex-Rockstar North President States He Never Visited Epstein Island</h2>



<p>In a recent statement shared with <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> through a spokesperson, the former President of Rockstar North, Leslie Benzies, has denied all allegations related to the ‘Epstein Files.’ Benzies described the claims as false and stated that he had a “three-month consensual relationship” with the individual making the accusations. He further asserted that he has never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor has he visited Epstein’s infamous island, properties, or plane. Interested readers can find the complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These allegations are false, I had a 3 months consensual relationship with this person, and I have never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor have I ever visited his island, his properties or travelled on his plane. Any suggestion otherwise is misleading,” the statement reads.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Leslie Benzies left Rockstar in 2016 and founded Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the recent flop, Mindseye. It’s important to note that mentions of Benzies and Houser come from Rom Ransome’s personal perspective and do&nbsp;not directly&nbsp;connect either of them to Epstein or the crimes he and Maxwell committed.</p>







<p>In other news, Rockstar North was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-dev-rockstar-north-hit-by-reports-of-explosion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit with reports of an explosion</a>.

            <guid>1424050</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Longtime <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-north-boss-leslie-benzies-is-out-after-nearly-1752495562">former Rockstar North president</a> Leslie Benzies was one of the people whose name appeared in the recent trove of Epstein files released by the Justice Department. It included an allegation by an alleged Jeffrey Epstein victim who accused Benzies of sexual assault. He denied the allegation via a spokesperson in a statement shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p>“These allegations are false, I had a 3 months consensual relationship with this person, and I have never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor have I ever visited his island, his properties or travelled on his plane. Any suggestion otherwise is misleading,” the statement reads.</p>

 <p>The mention of Benzies appears in a 62-page file released by the Justice Department that includes allegations from Sarah Ransome, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/epstein-accuser-ghislaine-maxwell-chief-orchestrator/story?id=81589520">who previously sued</a> Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell for alleged sex trafficking. Ransome also released a book in 2021 titled <em>Silenced No More: Surviving My Journey to Hell and Back</em>.</p> <p>The released file was an alleged witness list Ransome appeared to be compiling. In it she accused Benzies of sexually assaulting her at one point. She also mentions Sam Houser, the current president of Rockstar Games, but not in connection with any allegation. There is no evidence that any of the claims in Ransome’s document were vetted by federal investigators. Ransom could not immediately be reached for comment. Rockstar didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

 <p>Benzies is currently working at Build a Rocket Boy, a studio he cofounded after leaving Rockstar in 2016 amid litigation over royalties. It released its first game,<em> MindsEye</em>, last year. The shooter was critically panned, however, and became the subject of reporting and speculation about its troubled development. One YouTuber who has released several videos about the game was recently accused by Build a Rocket Boy’s co-CEO, Mark Gerhard, of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097">being part of an effort to sabotage the studio</a>.</p>

 <p>Gerhard threatened legal action against the creator, Cyber Boi, minutes after the latter published a YouTube video about Benzies appearing in the Epstein files. The video has since been deleted as a result of the threat of litigation. Build a Rocket Boy confirmed that Benzies remains employed at the studio as it continues updating <em>MindsEye</em> and working on its metaverse project <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>

<p>During a new interview, the head of Obsidian Entertainment has seemingly mentioned Microsoft’s 30% profit target. </p>



<p>For those unaware, back in October 2025, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> revealed that Microsoft had set a target to achieve 30% “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox. Microsoft had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-30-percent-debunk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debunked</a> the report, stating that the 30% profit margin target was incorrect. Now, the profit margin has popped up again in conversation with Obsidian. </p>







<h2 id="h-obsidian-talks-about-xbox-accepting-not-being-at-30-in-terms-of-profitability-standpoint">Obsidian Talks About Xbox Accepting Not Being at 30% in Terms of “Profitability Standpoint”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Obsidian Entertainment’s head, Feargus Urquhart, appears to have mentioned Microsoft’s 30% profit target. While discussing Justin Britch and Marcus Morgan, Urquhart’s lieutenants at Obsidian, the profit target was mentioned as something the duo will have to handle if they take the head’s place. The aforementioned 30% target is stated, along with the fact that this has pressured Xbox into publishing games on PlayStation. </p>



<p>The target appears to be achievable for Obsidian, provided they are allowed to keep experimenting. Urquhart mentioned that Xbox is still open to investing in riskier projects, prioritizing creative achievements over strong sales. Xbox does that even if it means to accept that where Obsidian is “going to be from a profitability standpoint isn’t going to be 30%,” added Urquhart.</p>



<p>The report also highlights other important details from the studio, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/obsidian-have-no-plans-for-the-outer-worlds-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no current plans to make a third Outer Worlds game</a>, what Avowed’s original pitch was, Obsidian’s plan forward, and much more. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nearly Half of Nintendo Switch Games Sales Are Physical]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-half-of-nintendo-switch-games-sales-are-phyiscal/</link>
            <guid>1424041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo’s recent FY26 report had a lot of eye-opening statistics, but an interesting one shows that, despite the push to digital media, nearly 50% of game sales were still physical, giving hope to purveyors of tangible media.</p>



<p>The death of physical media has been prophesied for years. Fingers crossed it never happens, as it means saying goodbye to steelbooks, Collector’s Editions, and all other forms of gaming physical media. New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> sales data suggests all is not lost, and your shelves won’t accumulate dust from a lack of game cases.</p>







<h2 id="h-physical-nintendo-switch-game-sales-going-strong">Physical Nintendo Switch Game Sales Going Strong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Physical media?! Image via Nintendo </figcaption></figure>



<p>The February 3 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial earnings report</a> had a big headline: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 remains the company’s fastest-selling platform</a>.</p>







<p>It’s a fairly emphatic statement about the console’s success, but if you dig a little deeper, you’ll see a note during the presentation about digital sales for the Switch and Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Digital sales through the third quarter increased by 14.7% year-on-year to 282.0 billion yen and accounted for <strong>50.4% of total software sales</strong> for our dedicated video game platform, down 0.6 percentage points.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On one hand, this indicates a strong digital presence; however, there’s a clear message here that pretty much half of Nintendo Switch media sold is still physical.</p>



<p>It’s also pointed out that “Digital sales increased year-on-year mainly due to an increase in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software and add-on content.”</p>



<p>Meaning, without somewhat inflated numbers as a direct result of digital-only downloads in DLC and expansions, the digital percentage might be lower, and physical sales might be above 50%.</p>



<p>Physical media isn’t going away anytime soon. We learned this last year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sold-more-physical-copies-on-nintendo-switch-2-than-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 selling more physical copies on Nintendo Switch 2 than digital</a>.</p>

<p>Modders have revealed something players would never expect: the arrival of Pokémon in Red Dead Redemption 2, and it looks really interesting. </p>



<p>In the case of Rockstar’s hit title Red Dead Redemption 2, players have just one question on their minds: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-version-is-still-coming-insider-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when will the rumoured enhanced version release</a>? However, given how Rockstar operates, the enhanced edition has yet to be officially announced, let alone released. So what players can do right now is wait, but while they wait, PC players have an exciting mod to look forward to. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-pokemon-mod-will-allow-players-to-catch-amp-train-animals-along-with-battles-and-gym-leaders">Red Dead Redemption 2 Pokémon Mod Will Allow Players to Catch &amp; Train Animals, Along with Battles and Gym Leaders</h2>



<p>Blurbstv has revealed the Red Dead Redemption 2 Pokémon mod on <a href="https://x.com/Blurbstv/status/2018387967937544390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), and the teaser is a thing of beauty. We see glimpses of all the features available in this mod, starting with how capturing works. Just like in Pokémon, Arthur is able to throw Poké Balls at various animals from RDR 2, including bears, dogs, snakes, turtles, lions, horses, and so many more. </p>



<p>Then comes the next bit, where players will be able to battle NPCs with unique types of moves. In these battles, you will also have to face gym leaders, who are members of Arthur’s gang. The teaser also shows a battle play out, with very Pokémon-esque elements attached to this game feature. Attack moves such as ‘Confusion’, ‘Body Slam’, ‘Venom’, ‘Molt’, and more were seen in the video. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I turned RDR2 into a Pokemon RPG</p><p>– Catch &amp; name wild animals<br>– Battle NPCs with unique types/moves<br>– Arthur's gang as Gym Leaders</p><p>Release: Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/37AHSZPQaJ">pic.twitter.com/37AHSZPQaJ</a></p></div>— Blurbs (@Blurbstv) <a href="https://twitter.com/Blurbstv/status/2018387967937544390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>There’s also a full-fledged YouTube video showcasing how Blurbs is developing and how to play through the mod. Things like replacing the throwing knife with a makeshift Poke Ball, adding UI to add nicknames, and so on. Towards the end, Blurbs revealed they plan to release this mod even though it is a troublesome process; however, no timeline was provided. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A big sign of emotional maturity is owning up to your most embarrassing failures. For Nintendo, that past mistake is the Virtual Boy, and for the better part of three decades, the company has mostly ignored its most iconic commercial and critical fiasco, likely hoping we’d all just forget they ever released a tabletop headset that was known for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-virtual-boy-nintendos-most-famous-failure">causing splitting headaches and eyestrain with its limited red and black 3D graphics</a>. Nintendo has never rereleased any of the Virtual Boy’s comically small library of just 22 games (several of which were exclusive to Japan), even when they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/08/13/from-virtual-boy-to-3ds">launched a stereoscopic 3D handheld</a> that would have been the perfect emulator. But 30 years later, Nintendo is finally ready to reminisce and poke some fun at this ridiculous footnote by bringing Virtual Boy to Switch 2 and Switch, complete with a very faithful (and expensive) accessory that recreates the original look and feel. And after playing several games that will be available in the launch lineup on February 17, I’m thrilled to finally be able to discover this lost corner of Nintendo history, even if there aren't very many games to dive into.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though they’re finally bringing some of these lost games back, Nintendo still isn’t making it very easy to access them. Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics will be available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers (that’s the more expensive tier that costs $49.99 annually for an individual membership here in the U.S.), and you’ll also need one of two accessories sold through Nintendo’s website to play them. The first choice is the $100 replica of the original hardware, and the second is a $25 cardboard model you hold up to your face like Nintendo’s experimental <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/16/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-review">Labo VR set</a>. You can slide your Switch or Switch 2 into either of these hollow models to supply the screen, and according to the fine print of the latest Virtual Boy trailer, you can only play these games with one of these two accessories – you can’t play them regularly in handheld mode or on your TV. The forgiving view of this decision is that Nintendo aims to preserve the original Virtual Boy experience as closely as possible, while the cynical view is that Nintendo just wants to squeeze more money out of its most hardcore fans for a silly novelty that probably won’t actually provide much playtime. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only saw the cardboard version behind a glass case, but I did get to go hands-on with the replica and instantly fell in love. I pride myself on having played most games from across Nintendo’s entire history, but the Virtual Boy has always been a big red-and-black hole in my library. Secondhand Virtual Boys and game cartridges are simply too expensive, so I’ve never pulled the trigger even if I’ve been tempted several times by various Facebook Marketplace listings, always stopping short when I see the previous owner wrote their name on all their cartridges in permanent marker. So as a hardcore Nintendo enthusiast who enjoys learning about both the good and the bad of their history (and talking about it every week on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99PCYdTX-vc5oSnnIsUbuSJk6Bli4SpL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Voice Chat, IGN’s all-Nintendo podcast</a>), I’m the exact target audience for this bonkers release.</p><p>The replica unit itself is really high quality.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The unit itself is really high quality. The headset rests on a two-legged stand with a knob you turn to adjust the viewing angle. If you squint or see it from a distance, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was an authentic Virtual Boy. The design is undeniably weird and cool, and I can’t wait to display it in my office. I sat down, looked through the red lenses, and saw the monochrome display staring right back at me. I wear glasses, so often when I try on VR headsets a bit of light bleeds through the sides, but the Virtual Boy’s rubber eye shade was big enough to completely block out 2026 and let me immerse myself entirely in 1996.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Seeing Red</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I first dove into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtual-boy-wario-land">Wario Land</a>, one of seven games included in the launch lineup and the game I’ve easily heard the best things about over the years. After just one level, I can see why it has a strong reputation. Apart from the lack of a varied color palette, it looked and played just like the classic Wario Land games, with Wario’s aggressive dash attacks and destructive platforming. This is a sidescroller, but it makes use of the stereoscopic 3D with obstacles like swinging iron balls that move toward and away from you, where the added depth helps you judge their location. Having never played Virtual Boy before, seeing Nintendo games in 3D again made me oddly nostalgic for early 3DS games that made good use of the 3D slider, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/09/super-mario-3d-land-review">Super Mario 3D Land</a>. Wario Land made use of the feature in its platforming, too, with segments that launched Wario into the foreground and background, an idea used a lot in platformers we’d get later like Mutant Mudds, Kirby Triple Deluxe, and Donkey Kong Country Returns. After Wario Land, I hopped around some of the rest of the launch lineup, including Golf and the Punch-Out!!-like Teleroboxer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only played for about 20 minutes, but I thankfully didn’t get a headache like the original hardware’s reputation would suggest. I’m honestly not sure how long I’ll play in one sitting when my own Virtual Boy preorder shows up in a couple weeks, because even though Wario Land was fun, it’s still kind of a pain to play. The edges of the screen were tough to see when looking in the unit, and it’s not the most comfortable feeling to crane your neck to look inside. At least it’s that authentic neck pain I’ve always wanted, though. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Would I recommend the average Nintendo fan drops $100 or even $25 to play these games? No, probably not. There are only seven of them to play at launch, and they are more enjoyable from a historical perspective than an entertainment one. You could buy seven superior indie games for 100 bucks that come in more than just one color. But if you love exploring wacky bygones from past eras and want a really cool accessory to display in your game room, you’ll probably really like the new Virtual Boy like I did. And there are more games coming after launch, including a previously unreleased F-Zero spinoff called Zero Racers, which is unbelievably exciting as an F-Zero superfan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I walked away not sure which is crazier: the fact that Nintendo made this bizarre piece of hardware 30 years ago, or the fact that they are rereleasing it now. The Virtual Boy sold roughly 750,000 units worldwide, and I’m not sure the market for this retro rerelease is much larger than that. It’s incredibly niche, pretty expensive, and there are only a handful of games worth playing, but they still chose to bring it back. And that’s one reason I love covering Nintendo; they’re the crazy toymaker of the video game industry. Not every swing they take is a smash hit, and I’m so excited to finally learn everything about one of their worst misses.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">The Complete Virtual Boy Game Library</h3><p>Create your own playlist from this listing of every officially released Nintendo Virtual Boy title.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been many storylines to follow in the Switch 2’s first year, but there’s one specific thread that's bugged me since Nintendo unveiled its plans last April – and it’s only grown more bothersome over the last several months: the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. This series of enhanced Switch 1 ports have been wildly inconsistent across their price points, amount of new content, and quality of enhancements, and I’m frankly tired of Nintendo filling out its release calendar with slightly updated versions of games millions of Switch owners already played several years ago. These feelings were solidified when I attended a preview event to play Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (yes, that’s the full title, and it’s one of the most hilariously unwieldy names in Nintendo history), which is already the <em>eighth </em>first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition since the console launched last June.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say what I played was <em>bad, </em>it just wasn’t particularly inspiring, and complete indifference has been an unfortunate theme across these releases. I sat down with three other journalists to try out a handful of cooperative and competitive minigames found in Bellabel Park, Wonder’s new hub area that contains more than a dozen multiplayer challenges. After selecting our characters from the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition’s slightly expanded roster that now includes Rosalina, we dove into our first co-op level. This one had two of us use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls to place platforms for the other two characters to leap across. It felt like something you’d have seen the GamePad used for back in the Wii U era, and it did lead to some clever puzzles for the mouse users where we had to guide a rolling ball along to break a barrier that was blocking the way for our partners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other co-op mission we tried was essentially hot potato with a Bob-omb, where the four of us had to work our way through a level while also passing an explosive back and forth. A timer would tick down whenever the incorrect player was holding the Bob-omb, leading to a frantic rush to both get to the end as fast as possible while making sure the right person was in control. On the competitive side, one game had us battling to feed our personal baby Yoshi the most fruit, while the other ones we tried were pretty standard races that had us bouncing to the goal or flying on a flower propeller. Before the match begins, each player picks from a small selection of Wonder’s badges to try to get a leg up, which is a smart way to remix the lineup of special abilities that felt somewhat underutilized in the main adventure.</p><p>There's fun to be found, but Mario Wonder's new content is awkwardly straddling the line between 2D Mario and Mario Party.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each game certainly had some fun to offer, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like this concept is awkwardly straddling the line: if I wanted multiplayer mayhem with Mario characters, there are so many other, better options like Mario Kart, Party, or 3D World, just to name a few. And, if I wanted 2D Mario, I’d much rather play the traditional <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> campaign, which I adore. To be completely fair, there is more traditional content on the way in Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition in the form of Wonder Effect boss fights against the returning Koopalings and extra challenges that take place in pre-existing levels, but I didn’t get to try any of that at this preview event. Even so, none of this Edition’s additions currently feel as exciting as a couple of extra brand-new worlds likely would have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Problems with Nintendo Switch 2 Editions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">And nothing here comes close to justifying the $80 price tag attached to Mario Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Yes, there’s a $20 upgrade pack for folks who already own Wonder, but for new buyers, a visually upgraded version of a 2023 Switch 1 game with a few new Bellabells and whistles costs more than 2025’s Switch 2-exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which just feels completely out of whack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pricing has been a big problem across the lineup of Nintendo Switch 2 Editions. On paper, I understand the math Nintendo is doing. First-party Switch games notoriously almost never see permanent price drops, so the Nintendo equation is a $60 game plus a $20 content expansion equals an $80 product. But it’s hard not to look at that and just think that it feels kind of greedy. A new generation is the perfect time to discount the prices of your last-gen games, and if Nintendo knocked the Switch 1 version of Wonder down to $40 and priced the Switch 2 version at $60, I don’t think anyone would bat an eye. And Nintendo’s third-party partners aren’t following suit with this steep pricing model: Square Enix recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2</a> for just $40 – $20 cheaper than it was at launch six years ago, and with all of its DLC and post-launch updates included. That’s a much more enticing offer for prospective buyers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’d be easier to accept the price points if the additional content was reliably great, but that hasn’t been the case. Last July’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> (another mouthful, and another $80 game/$20 upgrade) launched in what I would consider an unacceptable state for an enhanced rerelease. Firstly, its new content was fairly throwaway, and mostly felt like a way to try and sell the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera accessory for its gimmicky minigames. But the bigger issue is that the enhanced resolution – a huge selling point of these upgrades – only applied to half of the game, while one half was quite literally a drag-and-drop port of the Switch 1 version, 1080p resolution and all. Nintendo eventually released an update that ironed out some of that messy edition’s issues, but it’s still a more misleading, clunkier, and overall worse product than the Switch 1 version that dropped a year earlier for $20 less.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance and graphical updates for Switch 1 games on Switch 2 have been a very positive part of this generation so far. Games like Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom, Super Mario Odyssey, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-switch-2-upgrade-is-massive-and-it-bodes-well-for-legends-z-a">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> all look and run way better now on Switch 2, and those patches were released for free! Which is why it’s all the more frustrating when Nintendo paywalls performance patches for the arbitrary games they happen to make more content for. </p><p>It's frustrating when Nintendo paywalls performance patches for the arbitrary games they happen to make more content for. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby and the Forgotten Land had some noticeable framerate issues on Switch 1, and on Switch 2 it now runs at a flawless 60 fps… but only if you buy the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> game ($80) or upgrade pack ($20). Sorry, Kirby fans, Forgotten Land was chosen to get a batch of new levels, which means you have to pay 20 bucks to get the improved performance that’s free across most of Nintendo’s other releases. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> didn’t get any new content outside of extra lore and quality of life updates only accessible through a Nintendo smartphone app, but those cost $10 more rather than being free upgrades. Those two are also included as part of your Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, but none of the others are. Oh, and Breath of the Wild’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition doesn’t come with its DLC, that’s still another $20 on its own. There's a lot to follow!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I may not be a game developer, but apart from things like mouse, microphone, or camera controls, there’s not much actual <em>content</em> in any of these expansions that appear to warrant being next-gen only. I’m sure most of these multiplayer minigames in Mario Wonder would work just fine on Switch 1, but for seemingly no reason other than to push people toward Nintendo’s next-gen console, they’re locked behind the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is actually the exception that handled this correctly, adding its new items and features in a free update for both Switch 1 and 2 players to enjoy, while keeping the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades limited to higher resolution, mouse controls, and other niceties that actually don’t work on Switch 1. That Nintendo Switch 2 Edition costs $65 standalone or $5 for the upgrade pack, if you’re keeping score at home.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation.

These two launched alongside their Switch 1 counterparts on the same day as cross-gen releases. They cost $10 more than the Switch 1 versions, and deliver higher resolution and framerates, but don’t feature any Switch 2-exclusive content. It’s still technically a paywalled performance update, but it feels slightly more acceptable when it’s a brand-new game rather than dusting off an old one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the grand scheme of things, this obviously isn’t the biggest deal in the world, and Nintendo has still put out plenty of <em>actual </em>Switch 2 games like Bananza, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and more. But in an era where being a Nintendo fan is the most expensive it’s been since the cartridge days of the Nintendo 64, the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions feel like the most egregious example of Nintendo squeezing its most dedicated fans for a few extra dollars. It seems Nintendo wanted to repeat its strategy from the last console generation of porting as many Wii U games as possible to Nintendo Switch to make some more money and make the wait for the next truly <em>new </em>thing feel shorter, but it just isn’t coming across the same way this time. There were barely any Wii U owners – as of this morning, Switch 2 has already passed Wii U's lifetime sales in just seven months – so enhanced ports like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</a> were basically new games to most of the audience. And even though it was unfortunate that people who already owned these games on Wii U had to pay full price again to get them on Switch because of the shift from discs back to cartridges, they didn’t cost $5, $10, or even $20 more than they did originally for people jumping in for the first time. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Surely we’re still in the first wave of Nintendo Switch 2 Editions that were planned before the Switch 2 launched, so it’ll be interesting to see if Nintendo continues pumping them out based on how the marketplace responds. It’s tough to get a comprehensive grasp of their success because of how Nintendo reports its sales data across upgrade packs and the two platforms, but it’s worth noting they've failed to provide updated numbers for Kirby at all in the last two quarterly financial reports, suggesting its totals were likely soft. It’s entirely possible one reason these Editions exist to train studios on how to develop for more powerful hardware on projects with a short turnaround time, and now those teams are onto the next <em>new</em> 2D Mario, Animal Crossing, Kirby, and Mario Party with a bit more knowledge. I hope all of Nintendo’s teams swiftly move on, because this is a pattern I don’t really want to continue for the rest of the generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also went hands-on with plenty of Switch 2 games that don’t have ridiculously wordy titles (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-a-first-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-game-boxes">and box art</a>, for that matter), so you should check out my impressions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-leans-way-harder-on-the-mario-than-the-tennis">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-is-horrifyingly-great">Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata on Switch 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">my lovely time discovering Nintendo’s greatest failure: the Virtual Boy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is one of the strongest third-party publishers on Switch 2 so far. It released an excellent port of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/street-fighter-6-nintendo-switch-2-edition-gameplay-treehouse-live">Street Fighter 6</a> on the console’s launch day, and it’s keeping the momentum going in 2026 by bringing most of its big games to the platform, including Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-is-flying-toward-nintendo-switch-2-next-year">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> (with dedicated amiibo figures for all three games!). I went hands-on with Resident Evil and Pragmata on Switch 2 in both handheld and docked mode, and was extremely impressed with how these two slightly scaled down experiences are shaping up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d reasonably expect, the Switch 2 versions clearly don’t have the same fidelity as their counterparts on PC or the other consoles, but if you only have a Switch 2 or really value bringing your games on the go, the versions I saw were perfectly viable and didn’t make me wish I was playing on one of my beefier machines at home. Plus, I really enjoyed both games separate from my evaluation of their performance, and think they will each make excellent additions to Switch 2’s growing third-party lineup.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem: Switch 2 Impressions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Resident Evil. The demo I tried on Switch 2 was nothing new if you’ve been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><u>following the lead-up to Requiem</u></a>. I controlled newcomer Grace Ashcroft as she woke up on an examination table in a medical bay. This section sees Grace tiptoeing around dark hallways that are occasionally illuminated by flickering lights or blinking red alarms. It builds a lot of tension in these opening moments, like when I turned a corner to see an unidentifiable mass in the distance, only to cautiously approach it and see it’s just a horse statue staring back at me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was immediately impressed by Grace’s character model and animations in the demo’s introductory cutscene. It opens with a closeup shot of her eye, and it looked very detailed and pulled me into the world right away. That strong first impression carried through the rest of the demo. Requiem appears to shoot for 60 fps on Switch 2, and I didn’t notice any drops throughout my session. Granted, this is not a very action-heavy portion of the game – Grace is completely unarmed for the entirety of this segment besides glass bottles she can throw as distractions – but it was still great to see the Switch 2 keeping up with Requiem so far. </p><p>Requiem shoots for a smooth 60 fps on Switch 2, and I didn’t notice any major drops.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I found a lighter that let me explore a previously pitch black hallway I’d skipped earlier. The lighting effects that the lighter projected onto the wall may not have been as complex as on the other platforms, but it’s certainly not bad, and if I weren’t looking at it with a very critical eye, I probably wouldn’t have noticed. This dark hallway led to the main confrontation of the demo: a game of cat and mouse against a towering, terrifying monster with long, disgusting fingers that chased after Grace for the remainder of my playtime. It was very intense, and the biggest compliment I can give Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2 is that I was so terrified by being relentlessly stalked by this monster that any concerns I had about the version I was playing instantly melted away. All I could focus on was Grace’s survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After wrapping up the demo on the television from Grace’s first-person perspective, I swapped to the slightly less stressful third-person perspective in handheld mode and was similarly enthused with what I saw. Honestly, I think Resident Evil is far more fitting as a big screen experience with the lights turned off, but if you want to play it in handheld, the Switch 2 delivered a solid experience in this demo. There’s a noticeable resolution difference switching from the 4K television to the 1080p Switch 2 screen, but it still looked great and maintained solid performance, too. In third-person, I really like how Grace stumbled and tripped over herself while initially running away from the monster. She’s clearly as terrified and stressed as we are, and that small detail really sold it. I didn’t get to play as Leon Kennedy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview"><u>but based on Dale Driver’s recent preview</u></a>, I’m excited to try the more action-heavy portions that will balance out the terror I felt after completing Grace’s demo. Resident Evil Requiem is coming to Switch 2 (and other platforms) on February 27, and on the same day, Capcom is releasing Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village on Switch 2 as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Pragmata: Switch 2 Impressions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem is bringing the newest entry in one of Capcom’s most historic franchises to Nintendo players. On the other side of the coin, Pragmata is Capcom’s newest IP that’s also debuting on Switch 2. This sci-fi third-person shooter stars a soldier named Hugh and an android he names Diana as they explore a lunar research facility filled with hostile robots. I played the Sketchbook demo, which is the same slice of the game currently available to try on PC and coming to consoles at a later date. It covers Hugh and Diane’s introduction all the way through the first boss encounter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata on Switch 2 was similarly impressive, but I did notice a few more rough edges and fuzzier details compared to Requiem. My theory is that’s because Pragmata takes place in far brighter, bigger areas than Resident Evil’s claustrophobic hallways, exposing some more of its shortcomings. But with that said, it still ran very well and felt great to play, even in its more action-focused combat scenarios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I really like the spin Pragmata puts on third-person shooting. Hugh and Diana have to work together to take down enemies, as Diana hacks into the androids to deal damage, slow them down, and expose weak points. Hacking is represented by a grid minigame that appears when you target an enemy, where you press the face buttons to navigate a cursor to the goal as quickly as you can, passing through damage multipliers on your way. It’s snappy and satisfying to pull off, made better by the fact that the action doesn’t stop when you’re hacking as Diana, meaning you still have to aim, shoot, and dodge as Hugh at the same time. It’s immediately fun to split your attention between the two objectives, and I’m excited to see how Pragmata builds upon its unique foundation deeper in the campaign.</p><p>It’s immediately fun to split your attention between Pragmata's hacking and shooting.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running around the space station and solving light hacking puzzles was fun, too, and the heft of Hugh’s armor was sold by Switch 2’s HD rumble, as I could feel each footstep on the proper side of the controller. Just like Requiem, Pragmata was downgraded in handheld mode but still totally playable. Responsiveness is very important in Pragmata because of all its quick-time events, and the Switch 2 didn’t miss a beat in this demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom was the only third-party presence at the Nintendo Switch 2 preview showcase I attended last week, but I also got to go hands-on with a lot of Nintendo’s upcoming first-party releases.

            <p>Epic has released its usual stream of annual stats for the Epic Games Store, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-still-biggest-game-in-the-world-but-playtime-dropped-in-2025">a big increase in third-party spending and a confirmation of a notable drop in Fortnite playtime</a>. But alongside that the publisher-developer, engine-maker and storefront owner is also promising some major improvements to the oft-maligned store itself.</p>
<p>The headline improvements come in the form of much better speed, more features - noticeably social ones from player to player - and a cross-platform library between your PC and your mobile phone.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of things we need to fix," admitted Epic Games Store vice president and general manager Steven Allison said, during an interview with Eurogamer. "We have needed to fix them for years. We've been really focused on developer tooling and all the things we do there. But last year, we finally started to point more of our resources towards player experience stuff, all the things that our players have needed, wanted, and all critics rightfully take us to task on.</p>
<p>"We got a lot of stuff out the door last year, and this year is going to be probably the best year for that stuff on the 'big rocks'. And the big rocks are: the launcher sucks. Let's call it what it is. It's really slow," he continued.</p><p>"It makes calls to our back-end services to refresh every time you click around, and depending on your connection, you'll have to wait a couple seconds. And that just doesn't feel good, especially when people are comparing and contrasting and dual using one that doesn't do that."</p>
<p>Work on the architecture started in November 2025, he says, and is making "great progress. We're basically pulling the guts out, putting new guts in." Those speed improvements should appear for players around May or June, according to Allison, and Epic's official press release states "this summer".</p>
<p>"It should start to feel good, be faster and people be like, 'Holy shit. It doesn't suck so much.' And that will be a win for us."</p>
<p>It was a pretty candid acknowledgement from Allison, who seems well aware of the criticisms Epic has faced for its user experience. Another of those, in the Epic Games Store's lack of functionality compared to its main rivals such as Steam, is also now finally being addressed. He went on, "We have no social framework in the store, like other stores - even console platforms - [which] have the ability to communicate with your friends, and we just kind of stripped that out during Covid and never brought it back."</p><p>As a result, Epic is set to bring 'community spaces' to the Epic Games Store, adding avatars, player profiles and private messaging to cross-platform text chat, and adding voice chat and game independent parties from Q2 this year (Allison noted this is coming in May, to be precise). A cross-platform library will come in the autumn, along with new 'library management' functionality, region-specific storefronts, and a launch of the store on iOS in Japan in March and Brazil in June.</p>
<p>All this marks the first proper step towards addressing some of the many player-facing issues that have been raised by users over the years, from those lacking social functions to wider community features such as user reviews. One more that's set to arrive per Allison, that should go down especially well amongst internet users of a specific age missing the bygone era of static, non-instant-messaging communication: "a kind of forum-type experience," as he put it, which is set to arrive in test form later this year.</p>
<p>The prevailing question at this point is: what's taken the company, by no means short on resources, so long to pull these seemingly foundational features together?</p>
<p>Allison's answer was that it was "a two-sided marketplace," and "super complicated and hard" at first, as the store's sheer number of users on launch - approximately 30m users in the first 14 months - meant primarily focusing on the developer side. "We've got to get developers in the door, they are not going to deal with a back end where we have to do everything manually with them," and so "we really focused on that because free games was so powerful at the beginning," as an incentive to get the players to match the developers.</p><p>The store itself, Allison is keen to mention during our conversation, was ultimately launched as the "tip of the spear" for getting developers to a much higher revenue share of 88 percent to 12 percent, vs. Steam's infamous 30 percent cut (something currently the subject of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-steam-users-could-receive-compensation-after-uk-rules-valve-case-can-proceed">£656m consumer lawsuit here in the UK</a>).</p>
<p>"It isn't that we ignored it," Allison said, "but we had to get out of the super manual onboarding of important titles. We had to build the tools for self-publishing, and that took us, like, almost three years. It was a major focus of our engineering."</p>
<p>At the same time, Allison seemed very much cognizant of the issues players have had with the storefront. Now, the company is spending "the majority of our engineering time, focus and capacity on player facing features that we know we have to get to," he said.</p>
<p>"The criticism is all fair…" he continued. Citing a particularly blunt subreddit. "r/fuckepic - there are people that feel that way, and we respect that. But we know the players are going to be happy when those features show up, and we just gotta knock them out.</p><p>"And so I hope, like, two years from now, we're not really having this conversation anymore. The multi platform stuff is cool, the social stuff maybe is better than anyone's doing." The goal, within that period, is that Epic is no longer "in a deficiency [compared] to expected features."</p>
<p>"We're trying to attack all the big buckets of things that are fair criticisms, and we have to do the work. We just have to do the work."</p>

			<p><strong>Funcom</strong> has announced that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune: Awakening Chapter 3</a></strong>, the game's <strong>biggest update yet</strong>, is <strong>live now</strong>. This patch continues the main story following the events of Chapter 2 and <strong>significantly revamps the previously lackluster endgame content</strong>, introducing numerous new locations, systems, and gear. Wccftech watched a remote presentation by the developer to learn the key details and features of Chapter 3; you can read our in-depth report below.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-this-article">In This Article:</h3>



<ul>
<li><a href="#landsraad-overhaul">New Landsraad Mission System</a></li>



<li><a href="#new-pve-dungeons">New PvE Dungeons(Imperial Testing Stations)</a></li>

<li><a href="#raiders-broken-lands-paid-DLC">New Raiders of the Broken Lands Paid DLC</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="landsraad-overhaul">New Landsraad Mission System</h2>



<p>To start, <strong>the Landsraad system has been completely overhauled</strong>. It is now a contest between the Atreides and the Harkonnen to gain support from minor Houses. Previously, players gained standing by manually submitting resources, but this has been replaced by the new Landsraad Mission system, where missions are grouped into five distinct categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Crafting</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gathering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Exploration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Combat</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sabotage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These missions will lead Dune: Awakening players to various maps and reward them with a new type of Experience Point (XP) specific to their category. Upon accepting a mission, <strong>players can choose which noble house will receive the standing gained from their success</strong>.</p>



<p>The XP earned through Landsraad missions opens a new endgame progression path called <strong>Specializations</strong>. Players can unlock and purchase various traits using a small amount of <strong>Refined Spice Melange</strong>. These Specializations serve the purpose of allowing players to customize their characters based on their preferred playstyle, such as increasing headshot damage in the combat track or yield rates in the gathering track.</p>



<p>These upgrade tracks go up to level 100. Upon reaching level 75, players receive a unique helmet to show off their expertise in that field. Progression is capped at 35 missions' worth of specialization XP per week, effectively allowing for up to five missions per day.</p>

<h2 id="new-pve-dungeons">New PvE Dungeons(Imperial Testing Stations)</h2>



<p>Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 also expands the world of Arrakis: several new locations have been added, including the <strong>Ardent Garrison</strong> and <strong>Smuggler's Run</strong>. Another side of the endgame improvements is the long-anticipated introduction of five new <strong>Imperial Testing Stations</strong>, which function as themed PvE dungeons. Each station is centered around a specific hazard or element:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Darkness</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radiation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Electricity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Poison</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These dungeons are instance-based and can be tackled solo or in a group. <strong>The number of enemies scales with party size</strong>, and players can manually adjust the difficulty level. Higher difficulty levels scale enemy health, damage, and environmental hazards (such as increased electrical damage) while increasing drop rates for high-quality loot.</p>



<p><strong>Each testing station features a unique boss with distinct mechanics</strong>. For instance, Funcom showed that the boss in the electrical dungeon uses a disruptor pistol, and the combat arena features increasingly difficult environmental puzzles as the fight progresses. Boss health bars are split into four phases; the boss becomes immune during phase transitions as the room's hazards shift.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>I specifically asked whether there were any group mechanics, and the developers replied that there aren't</strong>. Which makes sense, I guess, since the dungeons are soloable. It is, however, disappointing for those specifically looking to get a PvE MMORPG-style experience; since they are fundamentally designed to work with just one player, they are unlikely to pose a serious challenge to a coordinated group, even if the number of enemies scales with the group size.</p>



<p>PvE players who are going to be exploring these dungeons can expect to find schematics for <strong>Augmentations</strong>, a new system for improving gear. These Augments can be applied to <strong>Tier 6 (Endgame)</strong> melee weapons, ranged weapons, and armor. The ability to apply multiple augments is tied to the <strong>Crafting Specialization</strong> level. For example, a level 10 crafter can apply an augment to their armor, with more slots unlocking at higher levels. Furthermore, Augments can be traded with friends, shared within guilds, or sold on the Exchange at social hubs.</p>

<h2 id="story-weapons-qol">Story Progression, New Weapons, and QoL Tweaks</h2>



<p>As briefly mentioned earlier, Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 also advances the plot as players pursue a murderer revealed to be a <strong>Face Dancer</strong>. Their investigation eventually leads to a <strong>Harkonnen Dueling Ring</strong>, where the Face Dancer is suspected of being the arena champion. Players must fight through various bosses, such as <strong>Thrax the Flamer</strong>, to reach the top of the ranks. The story will also introduce the leader of the <strong>Smugglers</strong> at their headquarters on Arrakis.</p>



<p>The patch also introduces two brand new weapons, the <strong>Pyrocket</strong> and the <strong>Dual Blades</strong>. The former is an area-of-effect (AoE) weapon dropped by the fire dungeon boss, while the latter is a fast melee weapon with a unique move set that consumes less stamina. Moreover, the Rapier weapon type has been completely reworked with new animations, flourishes, and a fencing-style parry-and-reposte mechanic.</p>



<p>The developers then highlighted that they've also introduced several quality-of-life (QoL) improvements, most of which were requested by the community. First and foremost is <strong>the complete removal of the tax system that required players to pay a tax to maintain their bases in the game</strong>. Additionally, players can now use the Base Backup Tool to store their entire base, allowing them to take a break from the game and redeploy it upon their return. Players can now also apply house swatches (color schemes) to crafting machines, containers, vehicles, and wind turbines, showing their allegiance more clearly. As a way to entice some of the lapsed players to return, the developers are also giving away the free <strong>Welcome Back Pack bundle</strong>, which provides resources, gear, and vehicles based on the player's previous research progression.</p>

<p>Going live with the free Dune: Awakening Chapter 3 update is the premium DLC<strong> Raiders of the Broken Lands</strong>, which is priced at <strong>$9.99</strong> (alternatively, it's included in the <strong>Season Pass</strong>, which costs <strong>$24.99</strong>) and provides access to the following items:</p>

<p>During this presentation, Funcom <strong>provided no updates on the console ports</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they previously said would be released around a year after the PC launch</a>. If that's still the case, they're only about four months away, but they could still slip a bit. We'll let you know once Funcom shares an official release date.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> won't be <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">toppling <strong>Steam</strong> anytime soon</a>, but the numbers shared by Epic in its <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review">Epic Games Store 2025 Year in Review blog post</a> clearly show that the digital storefront is growing. The digital storefront best known for giving away <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/">free games</a></strong> also saw quite a few players doing more than just claiming a free title each week, spending more time and money in third-party titles.</p>



<p>2025 was a year of record-setting for the EGS, as player spending on third-party games grew by <strong>57% compared to last year</strong>, reaching a record-high <strong>$400 million</strong>. Epic also added that the $400M number doesn't even include what players would've spent in third-party titles that process their own payments, like <strong>EA Sports FC 26, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, </strong>and <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>. </p>



<p>Developers behind those games, and any other that has its own payment processing, receive 100% of the revenue made from those purchases. Which, frankly, is what you would expect, seeing as how Epic spent <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/">years in litigation against <strong>Apple</strong> over the issue of not being able to process its own payments in <strong>Fortnite</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Other record-setting numbers include the <strong>2.78 billion hours players spent in third-party games</strong> through the Epic Games Store, an increase from 2024's 2.68 billion hours in third-party titles. That said, when looking at gameplay hours spent overall, players logged only <strong>6.65 billion hours,</strong> a decline from 2024's 7.72 billion hours.</p>



<p>It also reached a record-setting high in <strong>monthly active users (MAU)</strong>, hitting <strong>78 million MAU on PC in December 2025</strong>. Overall, player spending was up by 6%, reaching $1.16 billion, up from 2024's $1.09 billion. There are now over <strong>6,000 games</strong> available on the Epic Games Store for players to purchase. </p>



<p>When it comes to the Free Games Program, which seems to be driving a fair amount of engagement on the storefront, Epic gave away <strong>100 games</strong> in 2025, with players claiming a total of <strong>662 million copies</strong>. The value of the games claimed, in US dollars, totalled <strong>$2,316</strong>. The post also notes that the free games increased engagement in those titles on Steam, which feels like a nod towards a story from last month, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">an indie publisher noted that having their game go free on the EGS was great advertising for Steam sales.</a></p>



<p>Lastly, the EGS grew from 2024's 295M users to a whopping <strong>317 million users on PC</strong>. If you want to compare all of the EGS's numbers from 2024 to 2025, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/">you can check out its 2024 report here.</a></strong></p>



<p>As for what Epic has planned in 2026, the Fortnite company says it will focus on "<em>delivering long-requested features and deeper platform improvements</em>," specifically citing that the company is in the process of "<em>rebuilding the underlying architecture of the Epic Games Store Launcher</em>," with plans to ship these changes in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The changes promise a more responsive launcher that feels "<em>good to use</em>," with better stability and faster load times. It also promises community spaces in the Epic Games Store and the enhancement of the EGS's social capabilities, even adding voice chat and game-independent parties. It'll also add cross-platform libraries between PC and mobile games, and the introduction of regional storefronts with localized discovery systems.</p>



<p>"<em>In short: we're building a fairer, more open marketplace for players and developers</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>As we move into 2026, we remain committed to empowering developers and delivering the best possible experience for players, wherever they play</em>."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-for-xbox-drops-to-all-time-low-officially-licensed-by-microsoft-2000665101</link>
            <guid>1423975</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For most of us, Guitar Hero and Rock Band are just those gimmick games that were briefly popular for a couple years back in high school. But for some of us, it is life. The dream of peripheral-based rhythm gaming isn’t as long dead as you might think. The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is seeing a hefty sale on Amazon at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/">Normally sold for $150, it’s now down 33%, saving you a whopping $50. That’s brings it down to an even $100.</a></p>
<p>There are three models of the PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller, each designed for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. The controller is suitable for Rock Band games, as well as Fortnite Festival, though I’m sure there’s someone out there attempting to beat <em>Bloodborne</em> with this thing. Each model is officially licensed for the system its designed for. The Xbox one is also compatible with PC if that’s where you’re looking to play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7014/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve only ever played any of the Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using the controllers that came with the game, then you’ll find this one to be more closely resembling the Rock Band’s guitar controller. The five main buttons take up the entirety of the frets, and they’re also all duplicated higher up on the neck of the guitar if you want to switch up the way you play. The strumming trigger is also more akin to its Rock Band counterpart than it is the Guitar Hero one.</p>
<h2>Designed for Everyone</h2>
<p>The PDP Riffmaster wireless guitar controller is also designed for both righty and lefty guitarists, having a strap attachment available on both sides of the guitar. The buttons being the whole fret also support make playing righty or lefty feel more closely aligned. The strap itself is included with the controller as well.</p>



<p>Built into the front of the guitar controller is both a D-pad as well as a traditional analogue stick for easier navigation. The analogue stick is actually built into the neck of the guitar, while the D-pad is found on its face, beneath where you strum. The controller even has integrated volume controls so you can adjust on the fly, mid-song. And of course, gotta have the whammy bar.</p>
<p>Being a wireless controller, it works off a rechargeable battery. That battery should last you a solid 36 hours of playtime per charge. When playing, it has a 30-range of low latency wireless connection to work with, so feel free to rock out all across your friend’s basement.</p>
<p>When you’re done playing, the controller can even be collapsed for both easy transportation and for more flexibility when it comes to storage.</p>

<p>There's a lot of bangers in that list, as well as some day-one Game Pass launches that are certainly worth checking out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-2-given-february-2026-release-date-and-confirmed-for-xbox-game-pass">High on Life 2 is a big new release this month</a>, with skateboarding as a major new addition to the typical humour-focused FPS gameplay.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">You've got Kingdom Come Deliverance</a>, the historical RPG that kicked off the story of Henry and his rough and rowdy quest across Bohemia. It received a critically acclaimed sequel last year, but if you've not played the original now may be the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">There's also Avowed</a>, the latest big-budget RPG by Obsidian Entertainment. A first-person action RPG with a lot of love poured into it, it's perhaps the polar opposite to Kingdom Come Deliverance, but matches it in terms of quality. A big month for RPG fans for certain.</p>
<p>As with all prior months, Game Pass is also waving goodbye to a number of games. This month, it's just <em>Madden NFL 24</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Preview: Five Takeaways From My Time With Virtual Boy On Nintendo Switch Online]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Given that fans were expecting (or perhaps hoping, to be more accurate) to see DS games added to Switch Online, the upcoming inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> on <strong>17th February 2026</strong> is quite possibly the biggest surprise from Nintendo in recent years.</p>
<p>Did anyone really ask for this? Probably not. Is it pretty neat regardless? Definitely. Although the Virtual Boy's small library of games have been widely playable through, shall we say, 'unofficial' means, the headset itself isn't the easiest piece of hardware to come across these days.</p>
<p>So to finally go hands-on with the upcoming NSO variant of the Virtual Boy headset was both surreal and thrilling. I didn't get a great deal of time with it, but I managed to play enough to come away with five key takeaways. Needless to say, it reinforced my admittedly rash decision to pre-order the full-fat headset at <strong>£66.99 / $99.99</strong>, and I can't wait to get stuck in.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196709 @ 1770133824 -->
<h2><strong>The headset feels high-quality</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="751314974af8a"><a title="Virtual Boy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/751314974af8a/virtual-boy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is probably a given when you consider how much this thing is, but the Virtual Boy headset is really impressive from a build point of view. I was only able to handle it with a Switch 2 console already inserted, but it feels pretty weighty (while not being too heavy) and the dial you use to adjust the headset angle is strong and durable.</p>
<p>Even if you wind up not playing the NSO app all that much, the headset will make for a really eye-catching decoration to place on your desk or shelf. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>If the replica is a little pricey for you, there is also the cardboard version coming on the same day — though I didn't get to try that one out.</p>
<h2><strong>The lack of a Virtual Boy controller sucks</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="d58b52299d9c7"><a title="Virtual Boy Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d58b52299d9c7/virtual-boy-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see Nintendo add this later down the line (gotta squeeze every penny, y’know?), but I think it’s a real shame that the proper Virtual Boy headset doesn’t come bundled with a matching controller. I can understand the cardboard variant not including one, but I really wish we could get the complete Virtual Boy experience if I’m paying top dollar for it.</p>
<p>My hands-on session utilised the Joy-Con 2 nestled within the grip, which wasn't ideal. I suspect using the Pro Controller will provide a better experience, but man… I need a proper Virtual Boy pad.</p>
<h2><strong>Once you fine-tune the screen view, it looks incredible</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="778d140af7dd2"><a title="Mario Odyssey" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/778d140af7dd2/mario-odyssey.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I first wiggled my face into the Virtual Boy’s display, everything looked a bit off. The screen was tiny, and the focus was completely out of whack. I don’t know what the person testing it out before me was doing, but goodness, what a mess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, small software tweaks via certain prompts on the controller (similar to adjusting the controls in other NSO apps) allow you to customise the view, so you can shift the image left or right slightly to increase the focus, and you can increase the size of the screen so that it fits your entire viewpoint. Once you do this, the edges fade out slightly, almost as if they’re exceeding the boundaries of your peripheral vision. It looks really cool.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you wear glasses like I do, you'll probably be absolutely fine using the Virtual Boy. Unless they're massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heston_Blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a>-style frames.</p>
<h2><strong>You’ll need a really specific environment in which to play</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="54fbf2b353c10"><a title="Virtual Boy 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54fbf2b353c10/virtual-boy-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is true for the original Virtual Boy too, but if you want to play this thing for a reasonable length of time, you’ll need to set up the right environment. You can’t play it without placing the VB accessory upon a flat surface, and you’ll need to make sure you’re at the right height so that you’re neither stretching up or crouching down.</p>
<p>Case in point, the Virtual Boy I tried was set upon a counter while I was sat upon a pretty basic high stool. The height of the stool meant that I had to curve my back forwards in order to get low enough to use the headset. If you've ever popped your chin on one of those tonometer machines at the opticians, it's a similar setup. I’m getting old, man, it hurts to do this stuff!</p>
<p>I suspect the ideal solution would be to set it upon a desk, then use a height-adjustable chair to get in the right position. Angling the Virtual Boy to the optimum position does help a lot too, naturally.</p>
<h2><strong>Many of the Virtual Boy’s games are genuinely great</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="3c21836befda5"><a title="Virtual Boy Wario Land" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c21836befda5/virtual-boy-wario-land.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a> is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a> is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to try <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a>, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive.</p>
