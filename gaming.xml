			<p>Fellowship, a multiplayer online dungeon adventure game, or "<em>MODA</em>," as its developer Chief Rebel calls it, will launch in Early Access on Steam this coming October 9, 2025, developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced during the Future Games Show 2025 presentation. You'll be able to try it out ahead of that launch, though, as it'll have an open beta for players next month, from September 18-23.</p>



<p> "<em>All dungeons, all the time</em>," the trailer from today's Future Games Show boasts as it showcases new gameplay from the co-op adventure game, and that really is Fellowship's whole pitch. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo played the upcoming MODA earlier this year</a> ahead of one of its public playtests, he noted that "<em>strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like."</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to a press release, Chief Rebel plans to keep the game in early access for six months before reaching its 1.0 launch next year. While the early access version will include all the dungeons you might've already seen during public playtests or that you will see in the upcoming open beta, Chief Rebel is planning to have more playable content arrive as part of the 1.0 version. </p>



<p>The studio will also launch a cosmetics store with the full-game launch, though these cosmetics will remain optional and will not have an impact on gameplay. </p>



<p>Fellowship will be available for $24.99 USD on PC when it launches on October 9.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft doesn't have the biggest presence at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, but it's not entirely absent from the festivities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">The Rogue Prince of Persia was shadow-dropped</a>, and now a new province coming to Anno 117: Pax Romana has been debuted at the convention, alongside the news that fans will get their first chance to play it next month with a free demo launching on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The new province is Albion, bringing its wet lands and expanding on Latium, the province that was first shown off and the one that houses Rome. </p>



<p>Albion is a Celtic province, and it'll be your choice whether you want to keep and encourage Celtic traditions or assimilate the province under Roman customs. Either is viable, but whatever you choose will require its own unique approach and will further shape your own journey in Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo coming next month, it'll only be available for a limited time, from September 2-16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and of course, Ubisoft Connect. So if you want to check it out ahead of its launch this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">November 13</a>, then make sure to clear your gaming schedule for those two weeks, since there's no limit on how many times you can replay the demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-path-of-destiny-review-when-theme-is-only-skin-deep" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Path of Destiny</a>, and while we were unimpressed by its lack of strategic depth and paper-thin&nbsp;<em>The Witcher </em>theme, we persevered with the available expansions to see if they added anything more to it. Some of these expansions are crowd-funding only, and we'll specify which are available and retail and which aren't.</p>

<p>We previously covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-review" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Old World</a> and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-expansions-review" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/unmatched-witcher-realms-fall-and-steel-and-silver-review" rel="nofollow">Unmatched sets</a>, featuring characters from <em>The Witcher</em>. You can also read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-new-benchmark-for-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Witcher 3</a>, and check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">news</a> for the upcoming <em>The Witcher 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=ELtz6eF_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=rDRLM61Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny</em>&nbsp;Stretch Goals boxes includes more of the same from the core box, but also with some fantastic legacy elements.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Stretch Goals</h2>

<p>In <em>The Wticher: Path of Destiny</em> Stretch Goals box from the crowdfunding campaign, there are several new characters, stories, and extra play options, some of which will be available at retail eventually, and some are exclusive to the crowdfunding.</p>

<p>The <em>Path of Destiny</em> stretch goals box includes:</p>

<ul><li>5 new characters</li>
	<li>5 new tales</li>
	<li>Companion and Villain additional play options</li>
	<li>Voice of Reason additional play options</li>
	<li>A new solo opponent board</li>
</ul><p>The 5 new characters offer more of the same from the core game. They're a welcome addition, providing multiple options, including for solo opponents, but they still lack the depth and feeling I'd like in order for them to feel like real characters. Dijkstra and Letho feel the most thematic, with Dijkstra's initiative interaction and card selection abilities, and Letho's messing with other players, but they're all still let down by the once-per-game abilities that don't have a consistent enough impact to make you feel any different from any other character.</p>

<p>The 5 new tales offer a huge amount of replayability from those in the core set, giving 8 in total when all combined, but they all suffer from the core mechanics' lack of depth. The Skellige tale is the most stand-out, with a built-in mini-game where you try to work out who the killer could be.</p>

<p>The Companion and Villain cards add some more interaction with a companion card being placed by one of the face-up card drafts and offering use of their ability if the player picks those cards. 5 companions are available, each with 5 cards (except Zoltan, who has 6, including the crowdfunding exclusive Field Marshal Windbag card). The villains are all crowdfunding exclusives, with 2 of them, Leo and Vilgefortz, having 3 of their cards suffed into the normal card deck, gaining the players victory points when they're defeated, and Gaunter offering a pact, with a victory point bonus or loss if its condition is met or not.</p>

Once the conditions on the envelopes are met, they can be opened and their components added to your game. We won't spoil any here, but it is very cool to have elements permanently added when playing through new tales, especially if you're playing with the same group, or through a solo play-through campaign.</p>

<p>The stretch goals also include a double-sided solo board for playing against the Crimson Avenger/Crimson Asshole, which adds a bit more variety on top of the 5 extra solo boards for the new characters in this pack.</p>

<p>The first retail release that includes the strech goals products is Triss A Grain of Truth, which has the Triss character, the Grain of Truth tale and the miniatures for both in the pack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=pIUNfgm2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=AsjAYn7u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Legendary Monsters pack remove the tales cards and as a result, improves its grasp of theme and makes it more fun.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Legendary Monsters</h2>

<p>The Legendary Monsters expansion for<em> The Witcher: Path of Destiny </em>feels like what I wanted the core game to be. The focus is on fighting 1 of 4 available monsters, Ancient Leshen, Hym, Katakan, and Aguara. There are no tale cards, and the sole symbol is the fight symbol, with players needing to convert the other symbols to deal damage, or keep them to meet condition cards to gain experience.</p>

<p>This focus feels like it should have been the core gameplay all along. It doesn't even need to be monsters, the story cards could have contained the element players needed to work towards, chipping away at the target number, rather than the disconnected focus of trying to get symbols and work out what others might be getting. It's such a simple change, but the Legendary Monsters expansion completely changed my <em>Path of Destiny</em> experience and brought the theme to the front. The characters still don't feel unique or thematic enough for me, but the end experience was much more rewarding, it's just a shame it focuses on combat and not the other elements that make <em>The Witcher</em> so great.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=JoCwos2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=G6CmsxGm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Wild Hunt makes the core game 1 v many, and again improves the gameplay considerably.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Wild Hunt is another great <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> expansion that changes the gameplay to either 1 player controlling the Wild Hunt vs all the other players, or a solo player playing against the automa Wild Hunt. It uses the expansions' own Tale and follows mostly the same rules as the core game, only this time you are competing directly against the Wild Hunt, with their own character board.</p>

<p>On top of their character board, there is also a general's play mat that each of the 4 Wild Hunt generals advances on a track, gaining effects as they do. Each general also has an ability card that usually causes issues for the other players. These abilities, combined with the standard abilities on the player board, go some way to making the Wild Hunt feel thematically worthwhile, which will leave the other player feeling pretty jealous with their bland characters with limited in-game effects.</p>

<p>As with Legendary Monsters, it's such a shame that this is an expansion, and not the core gameplay, because it locks you into the single tale in this pack, rather than being able to take the most thematically feeling parts of the expansions, and use them in the core game. This means that while both of these expansions are fun, the replayability is limited, while the core, more lifeless game, has 8 tales for a lot more replayability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-6.jpg?itok=f7ga5e3x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-6.jpg?itok=0oY6SPtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Naglfar expansion adds to the Legendary Monsters and Wild Hunt expansion sets.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Naglfar</h2>

<p>The Naglfar mini expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding excuslive expansion for the Wild Hunt, or Legendary Monsters expansions, and requires the core game and one of those expansions to use.</p>

<p>In the Wild Hunt, the Naglfar ship protects a general from the players, and the players get access to the Broken Sextant cards to offset that, which do things like ignore the ability of the general protected by the Naglfar. In Legendary Monsters, you can use the Naglfar expansion to make the Wild Hunt a monster against which the players battle.</p>

<p>It's a nice expansion, adding another dynamic to the game, but if you missed it at crowdfunding, it's not an essential gameplay inclusion, unless you love Legendary Monsters, in which case this adds more than it does to the Wild Hunt expansion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-7.jpg?itok=08UKpNpN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-7.jpg?itok=xLXMJznG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Geralt on Roach <em>expansion&nbsp;</em>adds a mounted Geralt option to your game, but only really adds some randomness to the once-per-game abilities and nothing more.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Geralt On Roach</h2>

<p>The Geralt on Roach expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding-only expansion and won't be available at retail. Luckily, it doesn't add much to games, so if you missed it, you're not missing out on much. The expansion includes a miniature, a player board, and 5 starting cards for Geralt on Roach.</p>

<p>The miniature, as you would expect, shows Geralt mounted on Roach, drawing one of his trademark swords from his back. The player board changes Geralts' once-per-game abilities from the core set, adding in some randomness, allowing you to reveal a random card for an effect. The 5 starting cards are exactly the same as those in the core set, just with different art.</p>

<p>The one area that would have made this expansion interesting would have been a change to the starting cards. They're what gives you the most strategy in game, and differentiate the characters the most from each other. The once-per-game effects have little serious effect, and Geralt on Roach's are completely random, so beyond using the expansion once for fun, you'll be back using the core set Geralt.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-8.jpg?itok=VnvQn4H1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-8.jpg?itok=FYJKYBSd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny Ronin </em>looks absolutely glorious on the tabletop, it's just shame it won't be out much.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin</h2>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin</em> isn't an expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny,</em>&nbsp;it's a standalone game that uses most of the rules from the core game, with a few subtle differences. The main difference in the mechanics is that between each player, an alliance board is placed. These boards allow players to unlock their partner's abilities for use, which is done by playing matching symbols on the cards used in the draft, which include teacups facing different directions. Players need to play these cards facing each other to progress on the alliance board.</p>

<p>The other difference is that the tale cards don't have any text on them, the chapter cards simply detail which symbols are the active symbol for that chapter, and 2 of the 4 active symbol cards are put on the board. Victory and experience points are also reversed from the core game, with players now scoring victory points for the active symbol they have the least of, and experience points for the active symbol they have the most of.</p>

<p>Aside from the aesthetics, which are thematically glorious, <em>Path of Destiny: Ronin</em> doesn't feel that much different from the core game, which is still that the characters don't feel much different from each other, and apart from the focus on partnerships, it doesn't really feel much like <em>The Witcher,</em> and the card playing to match symbols feels a bit lifeless when compared to the art and components.</p>

<p>The art throughout is great, and when combined with the bamboo play mat, it looks amazing on the tabletop. It's just a shame that it won't be out much, because the core gameplay isn't up to scratch, and the fact that it is completely standalone, so the good parts of Legendary Monsters, the Wild Hunt, and the tale elements of the core game can't even be used as part of it.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Witcher: Path of Destiny Expansions?</h2>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> has some great expansions. Wild Hunt and Legendary Monsters both make the game feel like <em>The Witcher</em>, and should have been the core game. The fact that most are incompatible with each other just emphasizes the lack of join up with the products. The stretch goals, with the extra characters and tales, just add more of the same, and don't help the mechanics grip the theme, or add much variety beyond the tales' flavor text and once-per-game abilities of the characters. The voice of reason envelopes are a great addition, and add a fantastic legacy feel to the game, especially when playing in a consistent group, but I'm not sure the mechanics have the scope for that level of replayability, when all the new character and tale variety just add more of the same lack of depth.</p>

<p><em>Path of Destiny Ronin</em> looks glorious, and the gameplay changes are interesting, but it changes nothing in terms of how light the gameplay feels, and the lack of difference between the characters fails to capture any feeling of theme with them. It's also frustrating that it's completely standalone, and none of the other expansions, which are what save the core game, can be added to this.</p>

An open beta test will run from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250918T1700" target="_blank">September 18 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET</a> to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1700" target="_blank">September 23 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET</a>. <span id="more-984530"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ About Early Access on October 9</strong></p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a new title in development from Chief Rebel, a brand-new studio with industry veterans who’ve worked on major titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em><a title="Games > Diablo IV [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>, the <em>Just Cause</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> series and more. With Fellowship being the first title from the studio, Chief Rebel is thrilled to bring <em>Fellowship</em> into Early Access in under two months, letting players experience this truly unique and challenging yet accessible player-versus-environment dungeon crawling adventure and are involving the community more directly with the creation of the game. The upcoming Early Access launch will mark just the beginning of <em>Fellowship</em>, as this new title will be a constantly evolving adventure with a slew of content that will be added and evolve thanks to player feedback throughout the course of Early Access.</p><p>Those who embark on this adventure from the very beginning of Early Access will be able to experience the core vision of <em>Fellowship</em>: all dungeons, all the time—giving players the <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> they want right from the start. Following Early Access launch, there are plans for optimal cosmetic purchases to be available. However, these items will be purely cosmetic and not affect gameplay. More details on these items will be revealed sometime closer to Early Access launch. For the full 1.0 version of the game, the Chief Rebel team is planning on including more content, systems, and features. The team has several plans in-mind for content and features, however, they will also take feedback from our players to heart and may make adjustments if they hear that there’s something the community really wants to see. <em>Fellowship</em> is planned to be in Early Access for approximately six months, but this can change depending on community feedback—as Chief Rebel will strive to discover what the community wants in Fellowship to help shape it into the best possible game it can be before it enters 1.0 launch next year.</p><p><strong>■ About the Upcoming Open Beta</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The upcoming open beta for <em>Fellowship</em> via Steam will kick off on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250918T1700" target="_blank">Thursday, September 18 at 10:00 a.m. PT</a> and end on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250923T1700" target="_blank">Tuesday, September 23 at 10:00 a.m. PT</a>. For the Open Beta, there will be a North America, Europe and Asia server available. This playtest will give players the chance to experience seven heroes (two Tanks, three DPS—including a recently-revealed DPS, Mara, and two Healers) who will be in <em>Fellowship</em>’s diverse roster of heroes, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot along the way. Compared to the Steam Next Fest demo back in February, in addition to introducing a new DPS hero, Mara, the Open Beta will introduce new gameplay systems, including a fresh take on matchmaking and group finding, and an engaging progression system including Weapons, Gems, Talents, <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a>, Legendary items and more. Additionally, the Open Beta will introduce a new dungeon “Urrak Markets,” new gameplay features like cosmetic customization allowing players to change the look of different pieces of armor, new Gear, new Mounts, new visual element improvements and improvements on previous gameplay mechanics based on Steam Next Fest player feedback. The Open Beta will allow Chief Rebel to test multiplayer matchmaking improvements they’ve made, and give the team the chance to get one final round of player feedback before <em>Fellowship</em>’s Early Access launch.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_984531"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a multiplayer online dungeon adventure set in an exciting fantasy setting, with endlessly scaling dungeon runs. Players must focus on working together as a team, with an emphasis on skill, cooperation, and strategy to defeat bosses, collect loot, and work together to overcome ever-present challenges. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the “Holy Trinity” and build the ultimate team of tanks, healers and damage dealers to take down hordes of enemies and imposing bosses.

Players will never out level the game with seasonal updates, dungeon modifiers, new features and rewards that will keep each run fresh and exciting, adding another layer of replayability.</li><li><strong>Unique and Complex Boss Mechanics</strong> – Each boss has unique and varied mechanics, for a fresh experience every run. Enemy skills grow as difficulty increases and additional modifiers continue to challenge players as they grow and improve.</li><li><strong>Rewards, Loot, and Gear Galore</strong> – After each completed dungeon run, players will earn loot to make their characters even more powerful! The tougher the dungeon, the better the rewards.</li><li>Players will find that <em>Fellowship</em>‘s most unique feature that sets it apart is how it streamlines the dungeon running experience and how players can take part in endlessly scaling dungeon runs. Instead of grinding and spending hours to be able to access and go on endgame-like dungeon runs, with <em>Fellowship</em>, players can dive right into these types of dungeon runs from the beginning. Unlike other titles, including <a title="Genres > Massively Multiplayer Online [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/mmo">MMOs</a>, there’s no barrier of entry at all—whether it’s time commitment-specific or needing to get through a ton of prerequisite content—for being able to jump into endgame dungeons in <em>Fellowship</em>. Both newcomers and seasoned veterans will discover they can get the dungeon experience they want from the start, as they can choose to play Quick Play that offer more casual 10-15-minute dungeon runs or Ranked that offers a more competitive experience with Curses, Ascensions and difficulty scaling that drastically change the dungeon running experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p>Gamescom had a flurry of announcements during the ONL presentation, but also glimpses of already-announced games, including the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Taking on the role of Hornet this time around, the princess-protector is on a deadly pilgrimage in an unfamiliar world. At Gamescom, we got to go hands-on with the game, and you can check out the new gameplay in the video below.</p><p>As the game was delayed time and time again, fans became increasingly angsty about when it would actually be released. But here we are, and yes, we've played it, but there's a small caveat...which we'll get into.</p>

      </div>
<p>While it's not the best audio, so you can't appreciate the somber tones of Christopher Larkin's score, you get the idea of how Hornet moves and how her attacks work. As she was in the first Hollow Knight game, Hornet is equipped with her trusty needle, which also features a charged-up attack to do a little bit more damage. The boss fight with Mother was simple enough, and it's great to finally dive back into the world of Hollow Knight again.</p><p>However, you may recognize the footage, as we got to play this same portion of the game back at E3 in 2019. Maybe Team Cherry doesn't want to give anything away and felt this was the most put-together level to start out with for players who might have played either Hollow Knight or didn't get a chance six years ago.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-teasing-a-special-announcement-this-week/1100-6534072/" data-ref-id="1100-6534072">special presentation for the game on Thursday</a>, which could finally reveal an official release date and more information on the story itself. Team Cherry has said the game will be ready in time for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-still-coming-in-2025-according-to-team-cherry/1100-6533575/" data-ref-id="1100-6533575">a 2025 release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fifteen years after being canceled on Fox, <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/king-of-the-hill-texas-season-14-hulu/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMB9QNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFxNmJ5SHA1Ukh5ZE00ek1hAR6Eho8jFHZ1dguQy86TWfSc28TM5aErfFTg2PUOqZSRubzgGY4zmjknFyOb7w_aem_k9HwRj0yMTJjBQUVV9cv9g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>King of the Hill</em></a> is back. Its fourteenth season doesn’t only mark the return of Hank Hill, America’s dad before <em>American Dad</em>; it canonizes the <a href="https://x.com/RABtoons/status/1953969295698145748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme-belief</a> that the long-running animated sitcom is, in fact, our nation’s greatest anime. And it does so by pulling off a shonen classic narrative trope straight out of <em>Naruto</em>’s playbook: a timeskip arc.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill Season 14 | Credit Sequence Reveal | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R189-YSWvsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If the original run of <em>King of the Hill</em> was its <a href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-shippuden-anime-director-s-ocean-cut-filler-fan-1848765385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto</em> </a>era, then season 14 is its sequel series, <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>. <em>King of the Hill</em>’s time-lapse opening, which used to show a lazy afternoon with Hank and the crew drinking beers in the alley, now provides an update that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R189-YSWvsY&amp;pp=ygUia2luZyBvZiB0aGUgaGlsbCBzZWFzb24gMTQgb3BlbmluZw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills in the gaps of what happened during the show’s break</a>—like Bobby Hill moving out and Hank and Peggy going to work in Saudi Arabia before returning home—cleverly helping viewers catch up. Like its viewers (present party included), Bobby Hill has grown up, and so has the series. Like <em>Naruto</em>, <em>King of the Hill</em>’s timeskip serves as a narrative reorientation, graduating Bobby Hill from being the show's emotional core to its main character.&nbsp;</p><p><em>King of the Hill</em>’s timeskip doubles as a worthwhile thematic addition to what the show’s been cooking narratively (with propane, naturally) since 1997. The madcap adults who once shaped its younger cast’s suburban living now sit comfortably in the background with their narrative arcs largely complete. Now, they’ve become the mentor figures, Kakashis and Jirayas clad in denim jeans, saying “Yep” in a back alley with brewskies in hand, while Bobby, Joseph Gribble, and Connie Souphanousinphone navigate the messy landscape of adulthood in a world that’s changed just as much as they have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout its 10 episodes, the new season leans into shonen tropes with surprising sincerity. Topics such as generational tension, inherited trauma, the burden of legacy, and the slow, painful process of self-actualization are as present for Bobby as they were for his father in the original series. Growing up, Bobby Hill was my Naruto Uzumaki before I ever watched <em>Naruto</em>. And Bobby’s journey mirrors Naruto Uzumaki’s in ways that feel eerily similar. He was the weird kid who didn’t necessarily fit in, questioned everything, and had the uncanny ability to make folks laugh with how infectiously likable he was. Whereas Hank once grimaced at Bobby’s love of improv, yoga, and anything he deemed remotely “unmanly,” the new season reframes those moments as foundational to Bobby as an adult.&nbsp;</p><p>All lessons that followed in <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>, where Naruto, after a three-year absence from his hometown, made&nbsp;his grand return as a young man who would eventually become the hero he had always claimed to be. Although Bobby doesn’t return as a ninja, he defies traditional career paths laid out before him by sticking to his guns, not attending college, and becoming the head chef at an Asian fusion restaurant. Our boy smokes weed and fucks, all while following his nindo to live a curious life unafraid of celebrating what makes him happy, gender norms be damned. Granted, not everything is perfect for Bobby, but watching him navigate those early adulting struggles is as compelling as watching him navigate adolescence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill S14 | Official Trailer | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GleTI7jDWOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like any good shonen sequel, <em>King of the Hill</em> doesn’t just rely on nostalgia by playing familiar hits—it questions what it means to be a sequel that relies on cheap pop culture <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Memberberries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memberberries</a>. <em>King of the Hill</em>’s timeskip forces its characters and viewers to reckon with what’s changed and what hasn’t in good old Arlen, Texas, and whether it’s better to leave things in the past instead of wishing for things to be the way they used to be. Hank, now retired, returns to Arlen and finds himself bewildered by Uber review etiquette, all-gender bathrooms, and maonsphere influencers poisoning the minds of young men. But the show doesn’t resign itself to mocking cultural shifts. It explores them with the same quiet dignity and dry wit that made it a standout in the first place. Hank’s arc is no longer about raising Bobby right—it’s about learning to let go and trust that the boy he raised can carry on himself (and ask for help if needed).</p><p>Having watched the show as a kid, seeing Hank’s newfound trust in adult Bobby was a hard-won milestone. Since the show’s start, Bobby’s existence was always considered miraculous. He was famously born to a man with a narrow urethra and no butt, to a married couple who adopted their bloodhound, Ladybird, believing they would never have children. As a pudgy little guy and the son of a football quarterback who peaked in high school, Bobby’s coming-of-age was never going to be easy. He wasn’t athletic, didn’t conform to gender norms, and often clashed with Hank’s conservative worldview. Hank's complicated relationship with his son is also shaped by his troubled bond with his father, Cotton Hill, a Hall of Fame sexist who routinely tried to mold Bobby in his image. But that tension was the show’s beating heart. It gave viewers a father who learned to love his son not despite his differences, but because of them. It also gave viewers a son who never stopped being himself, even when his father said “he ain’t right.”&nbsp;</p><p>Season 14 doesn’t erase the legacy the show built as an animated sitcom that was not mean-spirited about child rearing — it expands on it. The only difference this time is that the show’s revival no longer reflects the world as it once did. If anything, its world is far kinder than ours. Still, <em>King of the Hill</em> addresses modern issues with the same conservative-liberal back-and-forth it always has, now with a bit more nuance, with Bobby as our main character. Throughout the show, Bobby questions progressive phenomena, such as Connie’s ethical non-monogamous relationships and the fine line between cultural appropriation and appreciation, as well as weighty existential fears like making space for his parents in his life before it's too late. All of these elements exceeded my wary expectations as a '90s baby who grew up alongside Bobby.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill | Recap | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwG1PjiBmi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>King of the Hill</em>’s cult status as an anime has as much to do with <a href="https://www.cracked.com/article_43623_japanese-king-of-the-hill-fans-have-been-arguing-over-subs-vs-dubs-for-decades.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subs vs. dub debates</a>, its relaxing slice-of-life pacing, and expressive character animation as it does with its emotional arcs. Speaking with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con, series co-creator Mike Judge acknowledged the fandom’s comparisons to anime, and it’s easy to see why in retrospect. The way its characters moved with a fluidity that rivals any Studio Ghibli work. What’s more, the show’s signature soft, comfy watercolor background art, which remained a series constant up until its thirteenth season, remains truly remarkable to watch all these years later. It was so spectacular that Judge felt it behooved him to note season 14’s digital animation, saying its watercolor look and hand-drawn style are <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/king-of-the-hill-hulu-f-bombs-voice-recasting-animation-criticism-1236335752/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the relics of a bygone era</a>. That’s as monogamous to the anime industry’s refrain about <a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-cels-are-starting-to-get-more-valuable-than-ever-1847242159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why modern shows aren’t cel animated</a> like <em>Akira </em>anymore as it gets.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="King of the Hill is a slice-of-life anime #sdcc" width="563" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6DPS-uAL4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Sure, my <em>King of the Hill</em> <em>Naruto </em>comparison would be more apt had I drawn a parallel to <em>Naruto</em>’s spin-off series, <em>Boruto</em>, which follows Naruto’s eponymous son and the next generation of brightly-colored superpowered heroes. But I haven’t watched <em>Boruto</em>, and frankly, I don’t have the spoons to commit to another shonen saga with no end in sight. What I do have is an infinite curiosity to see how the new <em>King of the Hill</em> fully Kakashi Hatake’s Hank Hill—letting him fade into the background while Bobby, Connie, and Joseph take center stage. Like me, they’re not the kids anymore, and they’re just as clueless as their parents when it comes to scraping by in a world that’s just as confusing, hilarious, and profoundly courteous as Arlen ever was. Long live<em> King of the Hill: Shippuden</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-voice-acting-soundalike-video-games"><h3>‘It’s Just Not Impressive If A Robot Is Doing It:’ Soundalike Voice Actors On AI</h3></a><p>Jennifer Hale joins voice actors calling for ethical boundaries as AI reshapes (and erases) the traditions of soundalike performances</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/king-of-the-hill-season-14-anime]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizard of the Coast's and Archetype Entertainment's <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is now out. This tabletop adaptation of the AAA sci-fi game, announced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">limited info in 2024</a>, is shipping out, and it provides a spacefaring twist on the rules of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Exodus TTRPG Release</h2>

<p>On their official webpage, Wizards of the Coast are selling two <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG books. The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> contains rules for both players and Game Masters to help them get started. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> contains rules on alien creatures, beings that inhabit abandoned starships, and uncharted worlds.</p>

The game's creative head is James Ohlen, a game industry veteran whose work includes the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Aside from some pre-rendered trailers and an episode in the Prime Video anthology series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, not much else is known about its core gameplay or its setting.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG helps shed some light in this regard. According to a deep dive <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/exodus/dnd-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wargamer</a>, players take on the role of Travelers. They are a community of space explorers who seek riches and advanced technology to bring back to their home world. The catch is that there is time dilation with FTL travel, meaning by the time they return home, years will have passed.</p>

<p>As for the RPG system at its core, it's <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition with some sci-fi tweaks. Gameplay caps at level 10 instead of level 20, but players' stats increase faster thanks to a Constellation tattoo mechanic. The game features four classes, each with two subclasses. Lastly, magic and magic items are replaced with substantive equipment, gear, augmentations, and spaceships.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is the latest part of a transmedia marketing approach to the Exodus game. This transmedia approach includes a novel, and the Star Heist actual play series.</p>

<p>The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> is available at an MSRP of $28.55. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> is being sold for $35.99. Alternatively, the two-book bundle is available for $64.54.</p>

              <p>Two free mods for the PC version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a> that removed the clothes from one of the game’s main female characters were removed by publisher Take-Two Interactive using a DMCA request.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, a pair of NSFW nude mods for the recently released linear action game <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>have been removed from popular modding site Nexus Mods by Take Two’s lawyers, according to a Nexus customer support representative on <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/">the site’s forums</a>. One of the nude mods replaced Isabella Torrisi’s in-game model with a nude version.&nbsp; The other mod, “Extended Textures For Nude Isabella,” allowed players to modify the character’s model, letting them give her “bigger nipples, bigger areola,” and even offering “cute pubic hair” options, according to text still indexed on Google search results. Both of these mods were created by Nexus user norskpl.</p> <p>“A takedown/DMCA request was issued by Lisa Deere [on behalf of Take Two Interactive Software, Inc.] on 08/12/2025,” posted a Nexus mod rep on the forums. “We were able to internally verify the legitimacy of this claim through the requesting of additional evidence to prove the identity of the claimant and the rights they hold over the content in question.”</p> <p>Interestingly, screenshots of the mod seem to indicate that norskpl didn’t create the nude model of Isabella themselves, but instead ripped it out of a different part of <em>The </em><em>Old Country</em> which features a nude Torrisi in bed with another character. It seems that they then tweaked the model and added options to modify it using mods. So in a way, this is like Take-Two Interactive’s lawyers DMCAing their own content. It’s an odd situation, but not surprising, <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">as in the past, Take-Two has used DMCA requests</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-interactive-removes-more-gta-mods-using-dmca-s-1848053219">yank down mods they don’t approve of in other games</a>, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-goes-on-another-grand-theft-auto-mod-killing-s-1847467984"><em>Grand Theft Auto V. </em></a></p> <p>Perhaps using the <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s own pre-existing nude model is the problem, as it is content owned by Take-Two being used in a way they likely don’t approve of. I wonder, had the modder had just replaced the don’s daughter with a nude Shrek or Thanos, if Take-Two lawyers would have shown up at all.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to get plenty of attention, and with the launch of a new limited-time game mode, several balance changes have also been made.</p>



<p>Now deep into Season 3.5, players will be forgiven for starting to look ahead to Season 4 and wondering what’s in store, but the launch of Klyntar’s Resource Rumble mode should keep you busy for the time being.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping on top of all the balance changes, however, so you’re familiar with all the buffs and nerfs. We’ve got all the details for you here.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-august-20-buffs-amp-nerfs">All Marvel Rivals August 20 Buffs &amp; Nerfs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Buffed. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals balance changes on August 20 impact three heroes, with Blade, recently added at the start of Season 3.5, given a buff, while Human Torch and Loki receive a nerf.</strong></p>



<p>Blade has boosted Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening, boosted from 60% to 65%, while the self-healing reduction has been lowered from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Human Torch’s Flame Field damage over time has been reduced to 20/s from 25/s, with Pyro-Prison damage also reduced from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<p>In the Strategist department, Loki’s Mythical Missile damage dealt by the God of Mischief and his illusions has been reduced from 30 to 25, although healing for teammates remains unchanged.</p>



<p>All other characters in the game remain untouched, though don’t expect it to remain that way for long as the big end of season balance patch is now just a few weeks out.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-marvel-rivals-version-20250821-patch-notes">Full Marvel Rivals Version 20250821 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The full patch notes are below, as shared on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250820/41667_1254957.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-duelist">Duelist</h3>



<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>



<p>The Daywalker’s resilience just slightly leveled up. Blade’s got more staying power for those midnight brawls!</p>



<p>– Increase Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening from 60% to 65%. Reduce self-healing reduction from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Human Torch</strong></p>



<p>Johnny Storm’s heat is still on, but his flame’s been dialed back just enough for ground heroes to catch their breath!</p>



<p>– Reduce Flame Field (right-click on terrain) Damage Over Time from 25/s to 20/s.</p>



<p>– Reduce Pyro-Prison Damage Over Time from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategist">Strategist</h3>



<p><strong>Loki</strong></p>



<p>The God of Mischief and his illusions are a tad less punishing!</p>



<p>– Reduce Mystical Missile damage dealt by Loki and his illusions to enemies from 30 to 25. (Healing for teammates remains unchanged.)</p>

<p>Skate made an appearance during the Future Games Show at Gamescom, with the big announcement being a tease for a major update next week as Early Access looms.</p>



<p>The EA title, relaunching the franchise after a 15-year hiatus, has been in Closed Alpha stage for months, but with the end of the summer looming large, big news is seemingly on the horizon.</p>



<p>In a developer interview shown at Future Games Show, details were shared about development, including the in-depth parkour features, with a sign-off to keep eyes peeled for a big announcement next week.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-poised-for-big-update-ahead-of-early-access">Skate Poised For Big Update Ahead of Early Access</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Early Access is coming. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The comments at Future Games Show align with a recent <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1957843556678136288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) directed to Skate Insiders, informing them that maintenance will take place from today, August 20, until August 26, leaving the game inaccessible.</p>



<p>With Summer 2025 stated as the release for Early Access, and just a few weeks left until we tick into September and leave the Summer behind, next week’s big update could well be the launch into Early Access.</p>



<p>Skate will be released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC, though it’s not clear yet whether the title will eventually make its way onto Nintendo Switch 2, nor do we know when a full launch will be.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on Skate’s social media channels for the big announcement next week, which we’ll also cover here at Insider Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Expression Games and Team 17 have announced a follow up to the 2021 WW2 multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a>, with this new game taking us to an altogether different war. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be set during the Vietnam War, which took place between 1965 to 1973, moving players from the battlefields of Europe to the jungle terrain of the South East Asian nation.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYzYNVWZ_A</p>


<p>When Hell Let Loose: Vietnam launches it will feature six different maps where teams of 50 will face off against each other to fight for victory and, much like the original, communication between players will be essential to getting the advantage. The Vietnam War was fought in entirely different ways to WW2, and that means there are new additions coming to in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p>These additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>
<p>A release date for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is to be confirmed, but it will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Expression Games has also confirmed that the original Hell Let Loose will continue to get support and updates too.</p>

<p>Given just how persistent the calls are for Battlefield to return to a Vietnam War setting, this is bound to be a popular announcement. We’ll have a preview of the game shortly.</p>

<p>In our Hell Let Loose review, I wrote, <em>“Hell Let Loose could become a real hit amongst those looking for a bit more of a grounded experience than Call of Duty or Battlefield. However, the experience will rely heavily on the community engaging with each other positively to put plans together and make the experience authentic. Hell Let Loose is a game about teamwork and without it the chaos of war will overwhelm a player.”</em></p>

			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is a new title from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-developers-showcase-new-pvpve-extraction-shooter-hunger-in-first-gameplay-trailer/">Hell Let Loose</a> developers Expression Games and publisher Team17, bringing the tactical gameplay of Hell Let Loose and the massive 50v50 battles to "<em>a war with no front lines</em>."</p>



<p>Announced during the Future Games Show today, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026, as a specific release date wasn't announced. It builds on the original set in World War II with its signature strategy-focused gameplay, where you won't be able to win any battle on your own, and you'll need to communicate as best you can with the rest of your squad if you hope to stand a chance at victory.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam takes place during the Vietnam War from 1965-1973, and throws players into the country's jungles across six maps, and it introduces a new category of troops with aerial helicopter support troops, and the use of patrol boats. You'll also be able to take the fighting into the tunnels and construct them while playing as North Vietnamese soldiers.</p>



<p>Even with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam coming next year, Expression Games is clear that it will continue to be developed alongside new content for the original Hell Let Loose, according to a press release for today's announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Squanch Games just debuted a new 42-minute gameplay demo for High on Life 2, the sequel to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/high-on-life-review/">comedy-driven first-person-shooter from 2022</a>, but more significantly for fans looking forward to the sequel, is that we also got an official release date announced, with High on Life 2 confirmed to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>February 13, 2026.</strong> It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>



<p>Set five years after the events of the first game, High on Life 2 begins by charging you with killing a senator that the game swears is evil, who wants to turn humans into pills with his pharmaceutical company, and get even richer than he already is. As a human yourself, you (presumably) don't want that to happen, and so begins this new adventure. Simple enough, right?</p>



<p>Or at least that would be the case, if the real driving force behind the narrative wasn't the fact that there's a larger conspiracy in which you have been sent a bounty to go after your own sister, and the successful life you've been building as a bounty hunter gets thrown for a new chaotic loop as you unravel the mystery behind the latest threat to you and the rest of humanity. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="42 MINUTES OF HIGH ON LIFE 2 GAMEPLAY!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m__l_bB13UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the more significant changes in the sequel that the gameplay demo showcases is how the skateboard your character rides on has taken over the game's main movement systems. There will also be new weapons introduced, and new areas to explore as the game is set on a planet called ConCon that seems to be made up of a bunch of floating conventions.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like Squanch Games has ramped up the budget this time around, as well as every other aspect of the game. But we'll have to wait and see if it all sticks the landing, and if this sequel can actually deliver on a solid gameplay experience instead of just delivering a bunch of jokes like the first game, and your mileage may vary as to whether you even liked the humor in the original. </p>

            <p>I drop the house into the great maw (not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-sword-surfing-creature-collecting-and-a-big-old-bucket-of-gamescom">that one</a>). It screams as it falls away from the clutches of my mouse clicker. It disappears from view, but there's a sickeningly wet crunching that betrays its fate. Oh and the fact that the entity's jaws immediately flare open once more, teeth and tongue dripping with anguish to cram vegetation, trees, towerblocks into its gullet.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">In Full Bloom</a>, a game that scores the full 10/10 in the wonderfully ironic naming category. Set in a greyscale universe sucked free of all hope and colour, it tasks you with accomplishing an impossible task. You've got to keep the infernal child of constant consumption happy by tossing an unending stream of junk into its mouth. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The demo I've just played for it has been out for a little while on <a href="https://obleakgames.itch.io/in-full-bloom">Itch.io</a>, while the Steam page foretelling a full release in 2026 went up a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magsch-no.bsky.social/post/3lrnffpb6zk2o">couple of months ago</a>. The thing that led me to In Full Bloom today, of all days, was <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958116759858250029">one tweet</a> in a thread, which featured a picture of Swiss studio Obleak Games' patch of Gamescom. I saw the giant mouth perched atop a dark planet, and decided this was a thing I had to play.</p>
<p>I'm glad I did. In Full Bloom's described as a Katamari-like, and the truth is that it's exactly what would happen if the folks who do Katamari were like 'Right, how can we take everything that doesn't make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end in this game, and flip it so that's a feeling so overwhelming you won't be able to forget it'. To put it another way, the game's like jumping into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC91V6D3nkhP89wUb9f_h17g">MeatCanyon</a> video about ASMR. Being not just present among the skin-crawling proceedings, but winding the crank that powers their descent into even more horrific depths.</p><p>Ok, I might be being a bit dramatic, but if you dislike the sound of people eating, this isn't the game for you. The demo has three stages - small mouth, big mouth, and bigger mouth. You start off with the first, feeding it detritus and colourless veg from a garden as it grows with each gulp. The entity's young at this point, so it makes panicked baby squeals and gurgles amid the slurping and swallowing of its three-toothed maw. I think they get more intense if you stop shovelling food in, but honestly they made me so uncomfortable that I couldn't entertain slowing down to find out.</p>

<p>Big mouth's grown up, so it has a full set of human gnashers and can gradually work its way up to chowing down a full cul-de-sac. Fences, trees, screaming houses. There's also a bus doing merry laps around the creature - you can have your weird son try to catch it by pointing with the mouse, but I didn't manage it. The lethargy of this movement, while saving In Full Bloom from being a fully static experience and undeniably fitting with the rest of its atmoshere, does mean there's nothing akin to the frenetic rolling that gives good universe Katamari its upbeat tempo and fuels a lot of the fun.</p>
<p>The sense of satisfaction you get from plucking up increasingly ludicrous amounts and sizes of object is still there, but that sense of satisfaction has become terrifying, as you sacrifice moons to a continent-proportioned pit of despair.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The demo will need plenty of fleshing out before it's a game I can see myself playing for more than one sitting. It's carried a lot by the novelty of the weirdness. As of right now, it's a top class metaphor for the mechanisms of capital, always desperate for <strong>more</strong>, demanding constant and unsustainable growth because as the game's description says, "there is only one way".</p><p>I reckon it's more universal than just that, though. It might be because the experience is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">fresh in my mind</a>, but I spent my time with it being reminded of how helping cover the biggest game showcases has often left me feeling so far in my career. I like video games, but when they're being fired at you one after the other, in a barrage of double digit minutes or hours, they tend to just blend into an overwhelming soup of lights, faces, rambling voices, bangs, booms, instrumental swells, platforms, release dates, jangling Keighs.</p>
<p>By the time your eyes have adjusted to try and take in one, the next has already arrived, like scoops of ice cream being fired from a machine gun. In the rush of the moment, the job's to be a speedy vessel of information, from the stream to the virtual page. Ice Cream. Vanilla. Travelling at 50mph. Could have been double scoop if £50.99 deluxe edition was bought. Publish.</p>
<p>There's a great skill to it, and even more of a skill to being able to take all of this in and occasionally give some useful commentary, like 'the consistency of that mint scoop as it flies by may hint at chocolate chips, which would be an improvement from the last one, the chiplessness of which I and many long-time fans disliked'. As with folks watching at home, there's a thrill to just seeing which games pop up, but the adrenaline rush is tied to a love of the scramble.</p>
<p>There may well be a day when this work feels more like classic Katamari rolling to me, but for now it's more like feeding In Full Bloom's great gob. Speaking of which, oh god, I think it's hungry again.</p>

Home Depot <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/economy/home-depot-tariffs-prices">just warned</a> home repairs and renovations will get pricier too. In gaming, the latest wave of trade-war-fueled inflation is already here. The average console is now anywhere from $30 to $100 more expensive than it was a year ago. Trump’s tariffs are a lot of things—<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">random, chaotic, nonsensical</a>. They are also secretly a massive tax on playing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>.</p> <p>Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster is expected to help sell millions of new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, the only hardware you’ll be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-take-two-ceo-price-80-ps5-2000616607">play <em>GTA 6</em> on when it arrives next May</a>. It’s the kind of release that gets people who have been holding out on upgrading or who dropped out of gaming altogether to walk into a GameStop or Walmart and pick up a new console. And doing so will now cost an additional 20-35 percent, more than the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/value-added-tax-vat-rates-europe/">highest sales tax in Europe</a>. And console pricing could get even worse. Who’s ready for Nintendo to announce a Switch 2 OLED in 2027 that starts at $600?</p> <p>Microsoft was <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">the first to pull the trigger</a> on responding to Trump’s trade war with price increases. In May, the Xbox Series S went from $300 to $370 and the Xbox Series X went from $500 to $600. Controllers and headsets also got more expensive. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">Nintendo followed suit earlier this month</a>, holding the line on the $450 price tag of its new Switch 2 but bumping the older models up by $50, with accessories getting multiple rounds of price hikes. Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">has now thrown up its hands, too</a>. Having already raised the disc-less PS5 to $450 with the Slim redesign, it’s going to be $500 starting August 21, with the other versions, including the Pro, going up by $50 as well.</p>

 <p>“Even though Sony is diversifying away from China (for US bound shipments), it’s still an important manufacturing center for Sony. 30% tariff on China, 15% tariff on Japan, 20% tariff on Vietnam, 19% tariff on Malaysia means Sony is impacted no matter what,” <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1958185512075690196">wrote</a> Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad on X. “I was expecting a $50 price increase because Sony has been proactive in adapting in the wake of tariffs. Xbox’s price increase being slightly higher is because of the increased dependence on China (higher tariff).” He notes that prices could still go up again depending on whatever Trump decides to do next.</p> <p>When <em>GTA 5</em> launched in 2013, a new Xbox 360 was as cheap as $200, and a new PS3 was just $250. In today’s dollars, they would still only cost $280 and $350, respectively. Trump’s tariffs are far from the only reason console prices have gone way up, but they’ve certainly made an existing trend way worse in the U.S. Trade groups <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">warned of billions</a> being sapped out of the video game industry if Trump went ahead with his most draconian tariffs. We’re not even in that worst-case scenario, and things already suck.</p> <p>None of this should be that surprising. Trump has been promising new tariffs for years. He campaigned on it. He got elected. He is doing it. And now we are stuck with the bill. The president has been promising for months to bargain his way out of dropping poll numbers and a possible economic recession by winning better trade deals and ushering in a new golden age of American manufacturing. So far, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-resurgence-jobs">it hasn’t worked</a>. It reminds me of lobbing a banana at the racers ahead of you in <em>Mario Kart,</em> only to miss them and end up driving over it yourself.&nbsp;Call it the art of the peel. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/tariffs-yes-we-have-more-expensive-bananas/">Those</a> are getting more expensive, too.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has just been unveiled by Team17 and Expression Games. In a follow-up to 2021’s Hell Let Loose, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam welcomes players to one of the most brutal and notorious conflicts of the 20th century, plunging them into 50v50 battles in the jungles of Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will debut with six sprawling maps and will feature land, sea, and air combat.</p>

<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-jungle">Welcome to the Jungle</h2>



<p>Vietnam was a harrowing war, but it makes for a fantastic theatre for video games. Historically, we’ve seen plenty of games pop up that have used the Vietnam War as a key setting, from Black Ops to Shellshock, and from Conflict to Battlefield.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the next take on the gruesome war that took the lives of millions of people between the 1960s and 1970s.</p>



<p>In a press release, Team17 and Expression Games revealed what players can expect in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set during the Vietnam War, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam offers existing and new fans a high caliber gameplay experience of authentic warfare where teamwork is the key to success. Experience 50v50 player battles across stunning, sprawling maps with careful attention aimed at creating an authentic, atmospheric and historically sensitive experience of events that occurred during armed conflict that occurred in Vietnam, between 1965-1973. </p>



<p>Retaining the gameplay base that fans loved from the first title, this is a brand new experience, utilising combined arms, with air, water, armour, infantry and support weapons that encapsulates the theatre of war feeling beloved by fans of the original title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players will be using helicopters to deploy troops on the battlefield and deliver fire support to squads pinned down by enemy fire. Patrol boats will strafe the shore, while Vietnam’s NVA forces will use tunnels and jungle warfare tactics to dynamically ambush enemies.#</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest trailer shows more combat and open-world exploration.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world action RPG The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin released a new trailer as part of gamescom’s Opening Night Live on Tuesday and also announced that sign-ups are open now for an upcoming <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">closed beta test</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presented by Netmarble, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin tells an original story set in Britannia, the same world as the globally popular The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. The art style is also inspired by those series, and the game’s multiverse narrative will transcend timelines and dimensions to combine brand-new characters with established heroes from throughout the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer continues a trend of releasing new footage at major game shows this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-action-rpg-the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-unveils-two-new-trailers?_gl=1*1i895aq*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTY3MDY1MTM0MC4xNzU0MDc1NTYw*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTQwNzU1NTkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQwNzU1NTkkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>Two new trailers</u></a> released back-to-back at Summer Game Fest and the Future Games Show in June, and now the gamescom trailer (which you can watch above) shows some brand-new footage and gives us a look at combat and exploration. The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is also scheduled to be showcased at Tokyo Game Show in September, and its presence at all these major game shows is steadily building momentum and anticipation of a release later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Narrated by the Japanese voice actor of Meliodas, one of the series’ lead characters, the new trailer begins by giving us a glimpse of its vast open world from atop a cliff. We then see a series of short clips of characters that fans of the series will recognize before transitioning to exploration of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s fishing and then the main character Tristan inserts blocks into a small monument and is rewarded with the appearance of a treasure chest. So it seems like the open world will have scattered environmental puzzles to solve and earn rewards.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/environmental-puzzle-1754502772701.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, there’s a look at traversal methods. A character jumps onto a spinning flower and rides its updraft of wind into the air before summoning a flying mount, and then we see the full party exploring a desert region on the backs of other flying mounts. So you won’t have to hoof it across Britannia all the time; that’s a relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer is essentially a supercut of several different characters in flashy, fast-paced combat against some wild-looking enemies. The combat showcase includes switching between characters to combo their attacks together, along with multiple different elements being used — lightning, fire, and ice all make an appearance. The trailer ends with 10 characters running toward the horizon together, giving us a taste of the large cast that will be available.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/huge-monster-1754502995894.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the trailer, Netmarble announced that they’re now accepting sign-ups for an upcoming closed beta test that will give fans a preview of gameplay mechanics, character interactions, and environments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can sign up on the game’s <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>, and everyone is eligible.
