            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Intelligent, stylish, and brutally hands-off, Routine is one of the most terrifying — and at times terrifyingly frustrating — horror games I've played for some time. Confident and cruel, it's a masterclass in show-don't-tell horror that freaked me out far more than I'd like to admit… and that's coming from a bona fide horror veteran.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All five of my senses are permanently on high alert. My ears constantly strain for the sound of stomping footfalls and humming electronics. My eyes dance about in the darkness, looking for a place to hide. My hands — misshapen and perma-clawed from clutching the controller so tightly — genuinely ache from stress. And yes, I can almost <em>smell</em> it here, too. Dust. Decay. Decades-old recirculated air lying over an unmistakable note of fried circuits. When I feel this overwhelmed, I'd typically cower behind a Pause screen to bring my blood pressure back down, but I can't even do that: bringing up the menu doesn’t actually pause anything, which means you can die — and I have — while adjusting your settings. Thanks, Dead Space.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Routine Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are only two horror games I've never been able to complete: Alien: Isolation and the very first Outlast game. Both scare the bejesus out of me, chiefly because there's no way to predict when a jumpscare is coming, but also because I absolutely <em>hate</em> being chased by things I can't kill. Routine delivers all of this and more, ratcheting up the fear through the very clever, very <em>intentional</em> design choices it makes, such as manual save points (NO!), randomized puzzles so you can't cheese them or look stuff up (ARGH!), and some truly devilish creature design that feels as though it's been plucked directly from my own nightmares (HELP ME). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced way back in 2012 — two years before the release of Creative Assembly's aforementioned Alien: Isolation, with which it shares much of its DNA — Routine is one of the most atmospheric games I've played in ages (and I do mean all games, not just horror ones). You, a software engineer dispatched to resolve a malfunctioning security system, arrive at Union Plaza, a tourist resort on the Moon, although there are no tourists, no staff, and barely even a functioning facility left. And despite the technical accomplishments that apparently got us to the Moon, everything in Union Plaza is gloriously old-fashioned. Like The Jetsons or the original Alien movie, it presents a dated, almost naïve vision of the future, with green-hued CRT terminals, limited technology, and fabulously 70s-esque patterned wallpaper. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take your trusty CAT, aka your Cosmonaut Assistance Tool. Yes, it lets you overload electronics, track clues, see in the dark, and gain important security clearance, but it's also a boxy gizmo that kinda looks like an 1980s video camera, complete with a cripplingly bleak battery life. Using it requires manual interaction — modules need to be physically slotted into place, and connecting to the short-span wi-fi requires a manual button press. All of it is delightfully fiddly, right up until you realize you may need to manually change out your modules while a Type-05 (a deeply unpleasant mechanical facsimile of a humanoid) is gunning for you, or you can't save until you find a wireless access point, which may or may not have a murderous robot patrolling just in front of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Routine gives nothing away. Absolutely <em>nothing</em>. No hints, no clues, no flashing items, no "Stuck? Click here!" lifeline. Admirably reserved, it's content to leave you fumbling in the dark for hours if need be, utterly unfazed by your frustration until you, say, accidentally spot a vent you somehow didn't notice before. It's deliciously cunning game design that I hate every bit as much as I admire, only elevated further by its careful use — or sometimes lack thereof — of sound effects and unsettling bangs and thuds in the distance. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, there's also no HUD. You never really know what state your health is in, which means you’re never certain how many times one of the creepy automatons can grab you before it's game over. You only know how many shots you have left in your CAT by "physically" picking it up and looking at the battery life. You don't helpfully zoom in when you're reading a dimly backlit screen, which can make reading memos and emails on flickering displays pretty tricky. Logging into things takes time you may ill afford thanks to 1980s engineering and a groaning dial-up system… especially when you learn that, yes, enemies <em>can</em> drag you out of your hiding place if they see you get into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's those emails and memos that really flesh out the story here, though, which is surprising given how missable they are (and how easy it is to get turned around and think you've already explored somewhere that you haven't). I can't say I thought it all made sense, or was wonderfully satisfactory or unique at the end — too many loose ends and unanswered questions meant it didn't quite stick the landing for me — but Routine's curious story certainly kept me hooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even for me — someone absolutely <em>terrified</em> of being stalked in the dark by unkillable machines — Routine loses a little of its luster partway through its roughly six-hour campaign. What once freaked me out began to wind me up instead. Manual saving is novel right up until, say, your PC crashes, and the hands-off puzzling is impressive all the way until you're fully, palpably lost and have no idea how to progress. You cannot reacquaint yourself with your current objective unless you are at a save station, or choose when to activate your flashlight, or even carry a spare battery with you. There's no map which, for someone with the directional sense of a turtle spinning on its back — also me! — is woefully cruel. And not being able to pause is an interesting wrinkle right up until you get an important phone call or the dog stands in front of the TV. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Vikki Blake's Most Terrifying Horror Games Ever List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From this point on, even the Type-05s feel a little humdrum. The stomping of their feet means it's impossible for one to sneak up behind you, and they're outrageously stupid, often unable to find you even if they chase you into an open elevator and you're crouching behind a box six inches away. Half the time, all they do is interrupt you, like a puppy with a new ball. That doesn't mean I don't often wish I could permanently disable them — knocking them temporarily offline just doesn't make me feel safe enough, which is <em>obviously</em> why permakilling them isn't an option — but there's so much "ammo" around (read: batteries) that you can often neutralize them and slip away without incident. Nor does it mean they don't freak me out (they do) or that I got acclimated to the tension (I didn't), but given that the enemies just aren't that clever, they're pretty easy to lose. (That said, I can't help but wish for a SOMA-esque 'Safe' mode to allow me to explore to my heart's content.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the puzzles? Few stumped me for long — it's fear that held me back, not the puzzle design — but I think some will be confused by them, not least because developer Lunar Software's lack of signposting means it's easy to overlook clues. If you take nothing else from my words today, though, you owe it to yourself to try to get through as much of Routine as you can without succumbing to a guide. Most puzzles are logical, sometimes maddeningly so, and it's always a rush when you realize the solution can be found by fiddling with the settings on your CAT. And that's what I loved best, I think. Those intelligent puzzles, intuitive tools, and a deeply unsettling atmosphere may not work for all, but they sure did impress me. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Routine surprised me — a horror veteran — in all the right ways. Its worldbuilding feels real, the environments are rich and interesting, and its systems and controls really do immerse you. Add in the plentiful backtracking, unkillable foes, and light-touch signposting, though, and I think Routine will be one of 2025's more divisive horror games. But even with its handful of frustrations, this is still one of the most terrifying things I've played in years.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Routine </em>is a video game that has been a <em>long </em>time coming. I first<a href="https://kotaku.com/a-first-person-horror-game-in-space-where-youre-not-s-5934814?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>wrote about it in 2012</u></a>! I wrote about it<a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-raw-fury-indie-horror-space-alien-isolation-pc-1849043193?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>again in 2022</u></a>, when we learned that the original version of the game had basically been scrapped and the team had started over, hence the long wait. But even that was three years ago!</p><p>So seeing it on Steam last week sent me. Had it been out for years and I'd somehow missed it? No, it just took this long to come out. I'm very glad it did though, because in several key ways, <em>Routine </em>absolutely rules.</p><p>Set on an abandoned lunar space station, you play as a guy tasked with finding out what happened to everyone, and maybe learning a little about yourself in the process. <em>Routine's</em> opening minutes are spent waking you up and giving you your first taste of its grimy, retrofuture world, and they're also the game's finest.</p><p>This game looks <em>amazing</em>. The art style is as far inside my wheelhouse as it gets; this is a lived-in sci-fi space, with giant blast doors sitting alongside wooden tables from the 1970s. Outside, lunar tram stations are full of advertising imagery that looks like it's from 1987. Everything is dirty and heavy and broken, and looks like it's been used a <em>lot</em>. I could spend days just wandering around admiring the sense of place that permeates every corner of the station. Even the fluorescent lightbulbs found throughout the station have little bits of branding on them, a level of detail I don't ever remember seeing before.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>The CAT is both a repair tool and a weapon. It is also, thanks to its button, immersive menu system and viewscreen, one of the coolest weapons in video game history</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It also helps that you <em>feel </em>so part of the world. You're wearing a space helmet, which distorts the edges of your view ever so slightly, and your big heavy space boots make every step considered, as though you're a person moving through a space, not a floating camera attached to the end of a gun. <em>Routine </em>has a very strong desire to commit fully to the first-person perspective, so there are no breaks to access emails or the save menu. Even your gun and all its settings are accessed directly, by looking at it and touching its buttons. You aren't gliding through <em>Routine</em>'s world, you are <em>in it</em>.</p><p>Which, like I've said, was amazing for the first ten minutes or so as I read some stuff, clomped around, opened some doors, dug through some people's stuff and just generally marvelled at the art design. But then, once you've got the basics of the world and how you move mastered, you meet your first bad guy. And my heart sank.</p><p>This isn't a general criticism of the game's design--the developers can make whatever they want, it's their game!--but man, <em>I</em> hate horror games. I just don't enjoy them, I receive no pleasure from their tension or scares whatsoever, and so in instances like this, where their accompanying world is so rich and ready to be explored, I hate them even more. I'd have happily paid to play <em>Routine </em>just to wander the station's corridors! Instead you spend quite a bit of time running and hiding from bad guys, which reduces much of this detailed world into a panicked blur.</p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Why are games like this and <em>Alien Isolation</em></u></a>, so noted for their intricate world-building and attention to detail, saddled with gameplay that stops you exploring and enjoying those same worlds in peace? Maybe the intention is precisely that contrast: to provide a world that immerses you, so that when you're threatened in it the whole thing feels extra scary. For me, though, it's just a frustration.</p><p>There isn't even a difficulty toggle here--again, not a <em>general </em>criticism, just something I as an individual like--to soften the blow, or the solace that if I can kill these guys they'll stay dead and I'll get that chance to explore in peace, because these killer robots are unkillable. The best you can do is briefly disable them.</p><figure><a href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Alien Isolation: The I-Can’t-Believe-I-Waited-Seven-Years-For-This Review - Kotaku</p><p>A game that was both seemingly made specifically for me, but also made to keep me at arm’s length</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>A bummer, then, but I enjoyed my brief time with <em>Routine's </em>world and weapon so much that I'll hold out hope that some day there'll be an exploratory or story mode released. Or, at the very least, enough time will have passed that a trainer or some cheats will come out so that I, the scardiest man in video games, can finally explore its corridors in peace.</p><p>(Anyway, because I spent more time enjoying the view than I did solving puzzles or evading bad guys, please enjoy these screenshots I took of <em>Routine's</em> incredible space station.)</p><figure><div></div></figure><figure><div></div></figure>

With trends and trendy games passing by these days, I'd understand if you'd already forgotten about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a>. I am not here to remind you of its existence to talk about it, more so use it as genre context for Dogpile, a new game that is essentially the question "what if Suika Game actually had a bunch of dogs and was also a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder?" I know, I know, there are too many of those already, but this one's just so charming!
</p>
<p>
First of all, the entire thing is hand-drawn and animated. I feel like the best way I can describe the vibes of the aesthetic is that it looks like one of those fancy greetings cards in a boutique shop that costs more money than you're comfortable with, but it's for your aunt who you quite like and want to get a good chuckle out of her.

<p>
Instead of matching different types of fruit, here you must fuse various breeds of dogs together to create larger, equally funny looking dogs. They don't just come in circles either, there's all sorts of shapes adding one layer of tactical gameplay. You choose particular dogs to play from the cards you draw from your deck, but to mix things up all of these canines can have different positive and negative modifiers.
</p><p>
For example, there's a friendly modifier that essentially magnetises two matching dogs towards one another. On the other end, there's a crated modifier that means those dogs can't merge at all for a couple of rounds. Dogtags allow you to add in even more ways to mix up rounds, like one that turns every dog that's smaller than a pug into a pug.
</p>
<p>
To be honest I find Suika Game quite displeasing to look at, and ultimately there's only so much it can do. Dogpile, despite being yet another roguelike deckbuilder, looks like it might satisfy that itch I have for something more. And it's out right now! Today! At 30% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3839300/Dogpile/">Steam</a>! What more can you ask for?

            <link>https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/</link>
            <guid>1379008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Coming into 2025, you might've thought that the most significant stories surrounding Rockstar would be to do with Grand Theft Auto VI's development, potential (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">and now confirmed</a>) delays, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-animator-seemingly-shared-grand-theft-auto-vi-animations-in-demo-reel/">or just anything else Grand Theft Auto VI related</a>, that's not where we're landing as the year comes to a close. Instead, the most significant story is the accusations of union busting that have been thrown at Rockstar, and the protests taking place by the fired workers and their former colleagues at Rockstar.</p>



<p>Now, for a second time, the matter has come up in the UK's parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat member of Parliament, Christine Jardine, being the first to bring it up</a>, and the second being Scottish Labour MP Chris Murray, who directly asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer about the issue. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-prime-minister-describes-rockstar-dismissals-as-deeply-concerning">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, Murray, who is the MP for the constituency where Rockstar North is located in Scotland, brought the issue to parliament after having already spoken to Rockstar. Based on the conversation he had, Murray said that the company "<em>failed to reassure me they are following employment law</em>,<em> and I share concerns about union-busting,</em>" which adds fuel to the fired employees' and IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain) union-busting accusations. </p>



<p>Murray then asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer, "<em>Does the Prime Minister agree, all companies, regardless of profit size, must follow UK employment law, and all workers have the right to join a union?</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="🔴 PMQs LIVE: Prime Minister's Questions - 10 December 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dg5n49OudY?start=1639&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Starmer responded, "<em>Well, it's a deeply concerning case. Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and keep him updated.</em>"</p>



<p>This whole saga began last month, with Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">suddenly firing 34 employees and being accused of union-busting in the process</a>. Rockstar first tried to deny the union-busting accusations <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">by claiming the fired developers had leaked confidential information</a>. That claim has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">directly refuted by the IWGB</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">other union members at Rockstar</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employees speaking up anonymously</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">The IWGB has issued legal claims against Rockstar</a> based on evidence it is collecting to support its union-busting accusations, and to make matters look even worse for Rockstar, a recent report seems to reveal that the 'confidential information' Rockstar claimed employees were leaking doesn't trace back to a host of GTA VI information. </p>



<p>Instead, it traces back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">a Discord server that was set up nearly four years ago for union members at Rockstar to discuss work conditions and union issues</a>, and the alleged leak was just employees in that server discussing changes to Rockstar's internal Slack policies. </p>



<p>According to the report, it is a private server that can only be accessed by IWGB members, union members at Rockstar, and employees at Rockstar who are interested in joining the union. All members are vetted before they join the server, with the only potential point of issue being that there are reports of employees who have left Rockstar remaining in the server.</p>



<p>It's still unclear as to how this issue will end. As it stands, the fired workers are just asking to be reinstated. There are no egregious requests; they simply want to return to work and help their colleagues see Grand Theft Auto VI across the finish line. Of course, Rockstar could try continuing to ignore the problem and hope it goes away, or if a fine does come down on their heads, pay it with the pocket change that falls out of GTA Online every month.</p>



<p>Hopefully, that's not how things conclude, and we see the fired workers return to work, if not before the end of the year, then sometime soon in 2026. Particularly because, though Rockstar's executives might wish it would, the protests outside the Rockstar and Take-Two offices, and the accusations, do not seem to be stopping anytime soon. In addition, a source speaking to Wccftech told us, in no uncertain terms, that the protests "<em>will not stop</em>" until the fired employees are back to work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve put maybe five or six hours into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, and I spent maybe two of those hours desperately searching for two items: Raichunite X and Raichunite Y. These two Mega Stones would allow Raichu, my favorite Pokémon who has</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span> never gotten any respect</span></a><span>, to Mega Evolve into one of two forms. I had been begging Game Freak for Mega Raichu for so long, I had honestly given up hope that my boy would get a superpowered transformation in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, then they gave him two. I like them both, but I gravitated toward the X form pre-launch, and now that I’ve seen the guy in-game, I’m feeling very vindicated, because my guy is flying around like Superman.</span></p> <p><span>Raichu never got a Mega form when the mechanic was introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, which was just one of the many examples of Game Freak and The Pokémon Company giving my boy the shaft in favor of Pikachu, his much more popular pre-evolution. Pikachu got the Gigantamax kaiju-style transformation in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, as well as exclusive Z-Moves in </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. The only time Raichu’s ever gotten any “love” is when Game Freak turned him into something else entirely by giving him a floating psychic version in the Alola region, and that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>imposter won’t stop following me around</span></a><span> in every game. Now, however, the OG can float around, too, thanks to Mega Evolution.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, Mega Raichu X is able to float like this because of the electromagnetic repulsion from his two tails. Before we saw him in-game, I imagined this would manifest in Raichu floating with a vertical stance, almost as if he were ascending with his tails pointed toward the ground. This would’ve probably looked silly, but I liked the design enough to let it go. What I wasn’t prepared for was to see that my super-powered mouse friend pulls a Clark Kent and flies with an arm extended like he’s got a city to save. Y’all, I am obsessed.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652249"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652249"><strong>“Cause I’m a punk rocker, yes I am.”</strong> © The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s a fun stylistic choice, but it actually has some pretty important perks in battle, too. Mega Raichu X can fly up to attack targets in the air, letting him knock Mega Shards off the sides of tall buildings and use physical attacks on flying enemies. This is kind of his whole deal. Mega Raichu X is the physical attacker, while the Y form is focused on special attacks. Now that he can fly, no one is out of range of a punch from his chonky paws. Neither Mega Raichu gets a type change after transforming, so while Mega Raichu X doesn’t become an Electric/Flying-type, I’m fairly certain he will gain the Levitate passive ability that makes him immune to Ground-type attacks, though we won’t know until a future game, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t include abilities. If that happens, Mega Raichu X will be one of the few Pokémon without any weaknesses, as Electric’s only weakness is Ground. That would be such a cool perk, and might make this transformation a force to be reckoned with in competitive play in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i></a><span> next year.</span></p> <p><span>Both Mega Raichus have gotten some flak for looking too similar to Pikachu, with X having its pre-evolution’s color scheme and Y maintaining its body shape, but I couldn’t be happier with these two. I like seeing the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-x-y-gorochu-scrapped-2000652133"><span>entirety of a Pokémon’s lineage show up</span></a><span> in its Mega form, and Mega Raichu X’s flight-based movement is a really endearing new page to add to that history. I hope this form shows up in the anime soon so we can have sick clips of Mega Raichu X flying around and whooping ass. Until then, I’ll be using mine to save the citizens of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>. It’s a Pidgey…it’s a Latias…no, it’s Mega Raichu X!</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s 2012. Barack Obama is president. Gamers are melting down over the ending of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>. Harvey Smith and Raphael Colantonio, then at </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span> developer Arkane Studios, are flying on a Bethesda-chartered private jet to Los Angeles for the Spike Video Game Awards, hosted by Samuel L. Jackson and held at Sony Pictures Studios.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span> is up for several awards, including Game of the Year (it loses to Telltale’s</span><i><span> The Walking Dead</span></i><span>), Best Xbox 360 Game (it loses to </span><i><span>Halo 4</span></i><span>), Best PS3 Game (it loses to </span><i><span>Journey</span></i><span>), and Best Action-Adventure Game (it wins). Jessica Alba presents Smith and Colantonio with their trophy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Man, when you get it good, and when someone says, ‘Here’s a bonus, and by the way, we’re going to take you to The Game Awards,’ you cry. Literally. We literally cried,” Smith told me over a video call.</span></p> <p><span>Things are a little different 13 years later. Donald Trump is president. Gamers are melting down over whether or not Lara Croft is hot enough for them. Arkane Austin doesn’t exist anymore (though both Smith and Colantonio are still working on games). And the Game Awards streams online as cable TV is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-paramount-trump-bidding-war-2000651372"><span>dismantled and sold for parts</span></a><span>. The only constant is the man who worked on both shows: Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the video game industry in which he operates has changed dramatically. Back-to-back years of layoffs and studio closures, market consolidation, and a race to embrace generative AI have left many developers dazed, confused, and unemployed. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-launch-paris-hilton-lindsay-lohan-xbox-ps3-1851231204"><span>Video game launches don’t have as much fanfare as they did in the aughts</span></a><span>—there are no appearances from Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan. And the Game Awards, while still boasting some Hollywood talent, isn’t as star-studded as the defunct Spike ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Organizing gaming’s Oscars</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes organizing for awards ceremonies that doesn’t get as much attention. The teams that work on putting together these events are vast, and often involve multiple companies that aren’t directly tied to the industry being honored that night (they might be production companies, security firms, contractors, and seasonal staff). The Peacock Theater, where The Game Awards is held, seats up to 7,100, and Keighley and company have to decide how they all get divvied up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cost of putting on an awards show broadcast on cable TV is offset somewhat by the ad sales from the commercials that air during breaks, but the Game Awards are only available on streaming platforms (no commercials), so Keighley sells coveted spots for reveals, trailers, and previews, as well as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472"><span>sponsorships for specific awards</span></a><span>. While some slots are reserved for the biggest surprises and Keighley curates free slots for what he personally wants to champion, others have to pay to get in front of the </span><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/game-awards-2024-viewership-record-1236253334/"><span>millions of eyeballs watching from home</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>And the prices keep going up. According to two sources familiar with this year’s show, a 60-second trailer during the 2025 ceremony can cost up to $450,000. A three-minute trailer costs over $1 million. Two separate sources in the video game publishing world said that while they had not been briefed on this year’s rates, these sounded in line with what they’d expect from previous years.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what about attendance? Tom Cruise gets to go to the Oscars, but he may only be allowed a single guest, and most of the people behind the latest </span><i><span>Mission: Impossible</span></i><span> flick likely won’t get an invite. You don’t see the gaffer from </span><i><span>Challengers</span></i><span> sitting at the table next to Zendaya, and Keighley clearly wants to evoke Hollywood-style allure for his annual ceremony (why else would Al Pacino be invited?).&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>However, the video game industry isn’t Hollywood, despite its best efforts. It’s not financially viable to invite 100-plus-person studios to attend the Game Awards for free, but do you know of a single awards show that offers for-sale tickets to its potential honorees, tickets which are pulled from the same pool as those sold to the general public (i.e., fans)? The Game Awards does.</span></p> <p><span>According to multiple developers from both smaller indie studios and AAA monoliths who wished to remain anonymous, the Game Awards only offers two tickets to attend the ceremony to studios that get nominated, though there was at least one instance in which a developer received more than that, and some overall confusion about which studios get preferential treatment (aka more than the two generally allotted). The Game Awards’ organizers did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>A source told <i>Kotaku</i> that Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind this year’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, bought a swath of tickets at face value (around $300 each) to ensure more of the team could attend. </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> recently set a record for the most nominations in Game Awards history with 12, so the desire to send as many people to the ceremony as possible makes sense. Sandfall did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>But not every studio has the means or the desire to send a large crew of developers to the ceremony—whether it’s due to ticket pricing, the cost of travel, or other factors.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>One developer who worked on a game nominated for Best Accessibility at the 2024 Game Awards told me that their studio had to “buy the rest” of the tickets, as there were “only two up front for our nomination.” The two team members who were given the free tickets through the Game Awards sat in one area, while the larger group was scattered throughout the Peacock Theater. The source said that the tickets the studio purchased for the developers appeared to be full price.</span></p> <p><span>“I was told that the team was offered two tickets as nominees (these tickets come with access to the red carpet and green room experiences), and then provided a link to a page where additional tickets could be purchased,” a lead designer nominated last year who wished to remain anonymous told me. “As far as I could tell, the page was just the publicly available ticket page, and there were no discounts or special access to ticket allotments (i.e., particular seats in the theater) available.”</span></p> <p><span>Because of this, the game director purchased their own ticket from the public-facing ticket pool for around $700. “I didn’t want to miss a likely once-in-a-lifetime experience of being there in person for a nominated game that I’d had a major hand in, so I paid.” The Game Awards did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Seat fillers and superfans</b></h2> <p><span>While restricted availability for nominees can be chalked up to limited space and funds, things get complicated when you open up attendance to an industry’s award show to the general public. Matan Even, the 2022 stage crasher, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23502321/game-awards-bill-clinton-rabbi-kid-matan-even-hong-kong/"><span>told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span> he bought a ticket to the ceremony during the general sale and “simply walked up from his seat in the audience alongside the award winners.”</span></p> <p><span>This year, tickets were released on October 30, while </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>nominees were revealed on November 17</span></a><span>. “Don’t watch the surprises—be in the room,” The Game Awards official announcement for ticket sales read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By November 7, I was told by the Game Awards’ organizers that there were already no more free tickets available for press (I received one last year as a freelancer and the year before through my work at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>). On that day, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3m52o6tzmb22b"><span>the Game Awards tickets ranged in price</span></a><span> from $58.92 for upper mezzanine seats to over $1,000 for resale tickets in the back of center orchestra (most of the high-profile attendees sit in the front of this section). Last week,&nbsp; there were three tickets available in the center orchestra for $997 each (resale), and a smattering of tickets surrounding that section, ranging in price from $500-$800. Upper and lower mezzanine seats, also sporadically available, were going for between $300 and $545.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year expressed frustration about the Game Awards’ ticketing process. Because they are no longer under contract with the nominated studio, they weren’t invited through the typical email from the Game Awards’ organizers, but still wanted to attend the event to celebrate their work.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>“Even if I had wanted to pay the inflated prices for scalper tickets, I couldn’t find 2 seats together,” they told me, with said tickets, according to them, running between $600-$1000. “At the very least, TGA should wait to sell general release tickets until after the nominations are announced…or have a separate bucket of tickets for devs who can provide proof that they worked on a nominated game.”</span></p> <p><span>Instead of buying tickets that cost more than some people’s monthly rent, the dev signed up for the seat filler program, which is organized by Gotham Casting. It’s unclear how many free tickets are set aside this way, but they wondered if the Game Awards prioritizes giving fans tickets over industry members because “the fans will scream and cheer for the trailers and the devs won’t.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The Eventbrite listing for seat fillers is directed at “ALL GAMERS and Video Game Fans &amp; Enthusiasts!” and promises “huge special performances to be announced” and instructions for what to expect on the day of the event. Seat fillers have to arrive two hours before the show starts and are instructed on how to dress (“men: upscale casual attire/button down shirts ok,” “women: cocktail dresses/upscale outfits”) and told not to wear cosplay, ripped jeans, or sneakers (unlike host Geoff Keighley).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“As a seatfiller, there will be an opportunity that you will be on camera,” the description reads. </span><span>“Seat fillers will begin their night seated in the holding area in the theater. As PAID TICKET HOLDERS ARRIVE, we move seat fillers as needed.” Seat fillers are also reminded that “guests have paid upwards of HUNDREDS a ticket for their seats!” and to make sure they “enjoy show [sic] &amp; have fun!” Gotham Casting did not reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Gaming’s biggest night</b></h2> <p><span>Keighley clearly wants the Game Awards to be big and bold and shiny—the best annual celebration of video games that monolithic studio money and Old Spice deodorant can buy. But there is a clear, consistent tension between putting on a show that honors the people working on video games and one that keeps the millions of fans watching in the hopes of seeing a trailer for </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a balancing act,” Keighley told</span> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><i><span>The Game Business</span></i></a> <span>in a recent interview. “There’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</span></p> <p><span>No one feels the wobble of that balancing act more than the developers, especially the ones who aren’t studio executives or creative directors and who struggle to even get tickets to the Game Awards every year.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the pricey trailer slots and expensive ticketing problem, many industry members recognize how important the Game Awards are to those who have spent their careers working on games. Smith and Colantonio spoke at length about how life-changing attending the then-Spike Video Game Awards was.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It’s career-changing, the market opens up to you in a way,” Smith said. “If you work in games for decades, you’ve probably gotten your teeth knocked out a few times. I’ve worked on games that got 60 percent ratings, I’ve worked on games that got laughed at, I’ve worked on games that got me fired, I’ve worked on games where the studio was shut down…Then I worked with Ralph, and we made several pitches that got killed, and we almost went under. Then we made </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span>.”</span></p>  <p><span>“It was easy for us to enjoy it, because there was Bethesda behind us, so we did not have to worry about paying for flights, what to organize, when to be there,” Colantonio said, referencing the 2010 acquisition of Arkane by Bethesda’s parent company, ZeniMax. “If Arkane in 2005, when we shipped </span><i><span>Dark Messiah,</span></i><span> had been nominated, it would have been just me there, period. It’s expensive, and it would have felt like a sacrifice.”</span></p> <p><span>Smith, well-versed in Arkane’s humble beginnings (the studio was started in 1999 by Colantonio and just four other men), recognized the struggle indie studios face when attending gaming’s biggest night. “If you’re a tiny French studio like Sandfall [the team behind </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>], the pay difference [between countries] means getting to LA, flying from Europe, staying in a hotel, eating there, all of that is way more expensive,” he said.</span></p> <p><span>For some, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267"><span>the Game Awards has felt more like an E3 presentation</span></a><span> where everyone wears suits (finally) than a proper ceremony honoring the people who made the year’s best games. Yet for those making games, especially at smaller studios, the importance of a Game Awards nomination cannot be overstated—a big win at the annual event could reinvigorate a struggling studio, or guarantee a second game gets greenlit.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some think we should all just ignore the Game Awards and their hyper-promotional approach, and instead direct our attention to more celebratory affairs, such as the BAFTA Game Awards and the Game Developers’ Choice Awards, where the focus is more squarely on honoring the previous year’s games rather than on promoting games yet to come.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“</span><span>Tickets for [the BAFTAs] are also paid (and include dinner), but the entire vibe of the event and the apparent reverence it holds for the nominated games and their creators was so much of a better experience,” the aforementioned lead designer nominated last year said. “It was an extremely stark contrast.”</span></p> <p><span>The Game Awards, like the video game industry itself, represent the chasm between the studios that develop games and can shell out for a million-dollar ad slot during gaming’s biggest night without hesitation, and the people who work on them, who struggle to afford a ticket to the ceremony meant to honor their work.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.</em></p>

                <p>Three-time Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro has revealed some of his favorite video games, including BioShock, Death Stranding, Red Dead Redemption, and God of War, among others.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52OOT_-5tqE&amp;t=2583s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>, del Toro said Sony's God of War series had some of the "best cinematic experiences" he's ever witnessed.</p><p>"When [Kratos] fights Odin [in God of War Ragnarok] and Odin keeps coming back and he looks like a Peaky Blinders brawler. He beats the crap out of Kratos. What a great video game. And the way they use the budget of data on the console to create atmospheric dispersion and light. That is lit like a film," he said.</p><p>The filmmaker went on to say BioShock is the "most immersive" game he's played, while he singled out Death Stranding (a game he is featured in) as another one of his faves. The game with the best universe is Metal Gear Solid, he added.</p><p>Some of his other favorite games include Left 4 Dead and "big sandbox games" like Red Dead Redemption. He also called out Shadow of the Colossus and labeled it a "masterpiece" that is "poetic and tragic."</p><p>Del Toro himself was for a period of time working on a game called Insane that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insane-cancelled/1100-6390635/" data-ref-id="1100-6390635">making alongside Saints Row studio Volition until THQ canceled the project.</a> He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/del-toros-insane-to-be-a-trilogy/1100-6285306/" data-ref-id="1100-6285306">aimed for it to become a trilogy</a>, and after it was canceled, the director said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/del-toro-not-giving-up-on-insane/1100-6398161/" data-ref-id="1100-6398161">not giving up on it</a> and looking to find another way to bring it to market. That never happened, however.</p><p>At The Game Awards in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-seemingly-teased-by-guillermo-del-toro-at-the-game-awards/1100-6498859/" data-ref-id="1100-6498859">del Toro seemingly hinted at a Silent Hill project</a>, but he later clarified that he was only trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-game-awards-tease-was-meant-to-tickle-the-ribs-of-konami-del-toro-says/1100-6499214/" data-ref-id="1100-6499214">"tickle the ribs of Konami"</a> after the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/">shut down his Silent Hills project.</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-fear-changed-the-legacy-of-p-t/1100-6525725/" data-ref-id="1100-6525725">AKA P.T.</a></p><p>Following the cancellations of Insane and Silent Hills, del Toro said he gave up on trying to make a video game. "I have proven to be the albatross of video games," he said.</p><p>"I have decided, in order not to destroy anyone else's life, I will never again get involved in video games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest batch of games joining Sony’s PS Plus subscription library in December 2025 has been revealed and it’s not a bad haul. In fact, it has one of the more overlooked JRPGs of the last few years on it: <a href="https://kotaku.com/granblue-fantasy-relink-review-pc-1851209297"><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>The Cygames-developed spin-off to the popular mobile franchise is part linear anime RPG, part <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and includes some excellent real-time combat thanks to the pedigree of the Platinum Games employees who helped make it. It combines the pacing and strategizing of an MMO boss battle with the responsiveness and ability juggling of a great action game. Plus, it’s multiplayer and includes an extensive end game. All told, it was one of last year’s bigger surprises for me and one I still feel like a lot of people haven’t woken up to.</p>

 <p>Here’s the rest of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">what’s coming this month</a>:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Skate Story</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Cat Quest III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix</em> | PS5, PS4<strong><br> </strong></li> <li><em>Paw Patrol World</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Soulcalibur III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <p><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> aside, the main headliners are <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-ps5-soulslike-nioh-sekiro-1850176726"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a><em>.</em> Despite launching in 2023, the former recently got a free update that added new story content and additional parkour options, including a dedicated jump. The latter, also from that year, is a Three Kingdoms-based Soulslike from Team Ninja that’s not quite <em>Nioh 2-</em>quality but is still pretty great.</p> <p>Everything above, with the exception of <em>Skate Story</em> which arrived on December 8, joins PS Plus on December 16. That includes<em> Soulcalibur III</em>, arguably the best entry in the fighting game series. It was also the first to let players create their own characters with the Create-A-Soul mode.</p>

<p>As well as the games themselves, <em>CorgiSpace </em>also offers developer diaries to show you how each game was made. Charmingly, Finji says some of these games "can even save progress". Imagine!</p><p>Games you can check out as part of <em>CorgiSpace </em>include run-based puzzler <em>Kuiper Cargo</em>, "mini roguelike" <em>Cave of Cards</em>, and <em>Mole Mole</em>, a sokoban puzzler with an explosive twist.</p><p>It's not just <em>CorgiSpace </em>Finji is announcing, either. If you're interested in making your own micro-style games, the studio is hosting a game jam between today and January 11th. It'll wrap up with a stream in the week of January 19th, during which Finji staffers and guests will play some of the games created as part of the jam.</p><p>If you want to get a sense for what <em>CorgiSpace </em>will play like and what you can expect from the collection, you can check out a trailer here.</p>

Rose <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m7hr6fuv5c2l" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">points</a> to another review that accuses <em>Little Rocket Lab </em>of featuring "forced politics" and of "force-fe[eding]" the player "DEI nonsense", also pointing to a review for <em>Yes, Your Grace </em>in which the reviewer claims the second part of the game "jam[s] in...DEI crap".</p><p>There are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001374812/recommended/2451100/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Privacy%20Policy%20Legal%20Accessibility%20Cookies%20Steam%20Subscriber%20Agreement%20%C2%A9%20Valve%20Corporation.%20https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026506561/recommended/2451100/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> making similar complaints to the one Rose has flagged as well, with Rose lamenting that "this is where we're at now" with Steam reviews and that the rejection constitutes a confirmation that Valve believes "I don't like Muslims" is "a valid reason to leave a negative review" on a Steam game.</p><p>It's tempting to slap the libertarian label on Valve and call it a day, but recent movements by the company with regards to games on Steam would suggest that isn't the case.</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indie horror game <em>Horses </em>was banned</a> from Steam and no explanation was offered to developer Santa Ragione, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not the only horror game with controversial themes</a> to be banned from the platform in recent memory either.</p><figure role="group">

The patch notes for the December 10 update detail various bug fixes and improvements across all modes, but some of the changes are a disappointment for Zombies players.</p><p dir="ltr">A few bugs are squashed for Season 1's new Astra Malorum Zombies map. The patch notes address an issue where Oscar could become stuck in the starting area, and it also fixes the map's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-zombies-wonder-weapon-how-to-get-the-lgm-1-in-astra-malorum/1100-6536739/">LGM-1 Wonder Weapon</a>, which could sometimes fire with unintended behavior when paired with certain GobbleGums and the Frenzied Fire augment. Unfortunately, this also affects a strategy players were using to help make the Wonder Weapon more powerful during the tough boss fight for Astra Malorum.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The update also corrects an issue that previously awarded players the completion rewards for the Astra Malorum boss fight even when the encounter was actually failed.</p><p dir="ltr">For multiplayer, the developer patches locations where players could leave the intended playspace on the following maps: Standoff, Fate, Scar, Paranoia, and Toshin.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also corrects an issue that previously prevented One in the Chamber from being selected as a game mode in private matches, and it addresses a bug that prevented the loading-screen stats from being displayed in the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's Endgame campaign mode gets small fixes as well. The update addresses a bug that previously prevented exotic-rarity weapons from making any progress toward their camos or base weapon levels. It also fixes an issue that blocked a player's dedicated melee weapon from functioning properly with the Mega Punch exotic skill.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side, the update buffs the Heartbeat Sensor equipment. This increases the sensor's detection range from 15 to 60 meters, and it improves the device's ping sweep smoothing for more consistent and cleaner scans when players pull up the monitor. The developer says this change was made to reinforce the device's role as an information tool.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Heartbeat Sensor is intended to serve as a counter to Ghost, but its previous detection range was not impactful enough to consistently influence engagements," the developer says.</p><p dir="ltr">Bug fixes for Warzone include one that impacted being able to see loading-screen stats and another issue with using permanent unlock tokens on perks while in the loadout menu.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>This update comes a day after the publisher announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/">major strategic shift for the Call of Duty series</a>.

		<p>Skeleton Crew and developer Panic Stations have announced Frog Sqwad, a slapstick physics-based multiplayer game for up to eight players.</p>
<p><iframe title="???? Frog Sqwad ???? Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2BGF12nGU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a frog with a sticky tongue, and that’s how you’ll get around and solve puzzles in Frog Sqwad. You’ll swing from pipes, drag giant food through tunnels, catapult friends, grow in size to become a megafrog, and more. Why are you doing this? Why are you and all your buddies in the sewers? That’s because of the Swamp King.</p>
<p>The Swamp King is endlessly hungry, and will demand for more and more food each and every day. You’ll go on runs, trying to earn gold to unlock more physics toys and gadgets, and just try to keep meeting quota.</p>
<p>Frog Sqwad – this is seriously hard to type out and not get letters jumbled up – is the first project from newly founded studio Panic Stations, which has been founded by a clutch of ex-Fall Guys developers who just want to make co-op games.</p>

<p>When Epic Games released Fortnite in July 2017, it didn't know at the time that it was about to change the video game world forever. Of course, it didn't change everything overnight. In fact, it didn't even change things with that initial launch. It wasn't <a href="http://wccftech.com/fortnite-battle-royale-mode-release-standalone-free-next-week/">until the battle royale mode launched a couple of months later in September 2017</a> that the real change started to occur.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2025, and Fortnite has been a phenomenon like no other. Here's everything we know about the battle royale phenomenon turned platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Fortnite was initially released on July 21, 2017, though the mode that made the game famous, its battle royale mode, wouldn't arrive until September 12, 2017. It has always been a free-to-play game, with in-game microtransactions available for players. It was initially available on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, though over time<a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-ps5-xbox-series-x/"> it has been made available on every current-gen console platform </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/">mobile device available</a>. Fortnite is everywhere you want it to be in 2025, with ways to play the game on almost any device you like, no matter its hardware capabilities.</p>



<p>Every premium microtransaction in Fortnite is made with its in-game premium currency called V-Bucks, which can be purchased in bundles of 1,000, 2,800, 5,000, and 13,500. V-Bucks can go on sale and have increased in price in the past, but the current pricing for each bundle is:</p>



<ul>
<li>1,000 V-Bucks=$8.99 USD</li>



<li>2,800 V-Bucks=$22.99 USD</li>



<li>5,000 V-Bucks=$36.99 USD</li>



<li>13,500 V-Bucks=$89.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>In-game skins, battle passes, and premium collaborations will be priced in V-Bucks, and like most live service games that came after Fortnite, V-Bucks can only be purchased in bundles that put you just below being able to acquire a premium skin, or force you to purchase more V-Bucks then you'd need, leaving you with a surplus (though not necessarily enough to buy two premium items).</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Nowadays, it's difficult to put Fortnite into a particular genre, because the reality is, when you throw in Fortnite Creative mode and the Fortnite Islands you can visit, Fortnite is any genre of game you want it to be. It's a racer, a rhythm game, a first-person shooter, a third-person shooter, a platformer. Whatever you want to build, Fortnite can become that.</p>



<p>But to keep things simple, let's stick to the core gameplay modes that made the game as popular as it is. Fortnite is a third-person battle royale shooter, where players are not only managing their weapon loadouts, but building and deconstructing wooden structures for a myriad of gameplay possibilities. Though mostly players build towers for extra cover and an extremely tall sniper's nest. </p>



<p>The storyline, which is there, however extrapolated it is, began with a simple premise. A company called IO created an island connecting every reality;100 players go in, one comes out, and the loop repeats. That also conveniently made it eternally easy for Epic Games to do every collaboration under the sun and get whatever characters you can think of into Fortnite.</p>



<p>That is at least how it started, all the way back in what's now known as Chapter 1, which includes the first eleven seasons, including Season 0. Now, we're all the way in Chapter 7, with each chapter including at least four seasons, if not more, so you can imagine how much has happened.</p>



<p>But the basic premise of Fortnite being set in a battle royale island that connects every reality ever has not changed, and will not change, so long as more characters from franchises you love can be made into Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-chapter-and-season-in-fortnite-so-far">Every Chapter and Season in Fortnite so far </h2>



<p>This section will continuously be updated, because Fortnite is consistently getting new seasons and eventually new chapters. So this list is always only as complete as it can be at the time of this writing.</p>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Chapter 7
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-seven-pacific-break-golden-goast-self-revive-new-dbno-options/">Season 1: Pacific Break - Nov. 29, 2025-Mar. 4, 2026</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Like every season before it, Season 1 of Chapter 7 includes a few new things for players to keep in mind. A new island, the addition of Storm Surfing, and most importantly for players, self-revives. The new island, Golden Coast, turns the latest map into a Fortnite version of Hollywood, and features a Quentin Tarantino collaboration <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/">that also made history for fans of Tarantino's work, specifically his Kill Bill movies</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Describing the gameplay in Fortnite in 2025 runs into the same problems you have when trying to decide what genre to put the game in. Technically, the gameplay can be a whole host of things because of Fortnite Islands, which let you jump from entirely different kinds of games made within Fortnite, made either by Epic Games, other professional development studios, or just other users. </p>



<p>So, narrowing the scope down to just the core mode that initially put Fortnite on the map, Fortnite is a third-person battle royale action game/shooter, where players compete to be the last one standing out of 100 other competitors. You'll drop into a large map, search for loot to arm yourself, and (in the original build mode) gather resources like Wood, Stone, or Metal, to build structures that can help give you an advantage over other players with additional verticality and give you cover from opposing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Fortnite is famously not a very taxing game to run, no matter what hardware you have at your disposal. Technically speaking, with services like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Amazon Luna, and NVIDIA GeForce NOW, you can play Fortnite on any device that can connect to those services.</p>



<p>If you have the hardware for it, then you can push Fortnite pretty far, as it supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-is-getting-rtx-dlss-and-reflex-on-thursday-september-17th/">ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex</a>. But part of its appeal, particularly with its visual language, is that Fortnite doesn't need to be played on top-of-the-line hardware to look fairly decent and run at a solid frame rate.</p>



<p>On Windows, here are the official technical specifications from the game's listing on the Epic Games Store:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended - Epic Quality Preset</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit version 1703</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-Bit</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-Bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Core i3-3225 3.3 GHz</td><td>Core i5-7300U 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen 3 3300U</td><td>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700x</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8GB </td><td>16GB or higher, 8GB of VRAM or higher</td><td>16GB or higher, 8GB of VRAM or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Intel HD 4000 / AMD Radeon Vega 8</td><td>NVIDIA GTX 960 / AMD R9 280 or equivalent DX11 GPU</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>100+ GB available (SSD strongly recommended)</td><td>100+ GB available SSD</td><td>100+ GB available SSD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Fortnite is not available on Mac, though you can still play it on a Mac through the aforementioned cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>Here are the official technical specifications for Fortnite on Android devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor</li>



<li>Android OS 10.0 or higher</li>



<li>Minimum 4GB of RAM</li>



<li>GPU:
<ul>
<li>Adreno 530 or higher</li>



<li>Mali-G71 MP20</li>



<li>Mali-G72 MP12 or higher</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For iOS users, Fortnite is compatible with your device so long as you have at least 4GB of RAM and are running iOS 17.6.1 or higher. As a standard rule, iPhone 11 or higher models are compatible, save for the iPhone SE Generation 2 phones (iPhone SE 2020), which come with only 3GB of RAM.</p>

		<p>CorgiSpace has been revealed by Canabalt creator Adam “Atomic” Saltsman, a collection of original Pico-8 sized games that have “short legs” on purpose. It’s available now from Steam and itch.io.</p>
<p><iframe title="CorgiSpace | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaH_5CDT7Vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been at Finji for a good long while and helped create larger games such as Night in the Woods and Tunic, Adam Atomic felt like getting back to smaller experiences, and started to create little quirky games based off quick and funny ideas.</p>
<p>There’s more than a dozen games in the collection, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rat Dreams – a soulslike where you have to dodge roll everywhere</li>
<li>Dust Settlers – a tetris-like where you’re terraforming planets</li>
<li>Skeleton Gelatin – a metroidvania with no upgrades or jumping</li>
<li>Prince of Prussia – a game where you’re stabbing Nazis, but in a fun way</li>
<li>Vampire vs. Pope Army</li>
<li>Dust Bunny – Eat all the dust</li>
<li>Dermis – Shoot asteroid and save the Moon</li>
</ul>
<p>And plenty more beyond that.</p>

<p>You should be able to explore each game in under an hour, but some of them with –&nbsp;<em>gasp –&nbsp;</em>save your progress!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/10/scramble-knights-royale-blends-classic-zelda-with-a-bit-of-battle-royale/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Funktronic Labs has revealed Scramble Knights Royale, a game that essentially blends together the Zelda-like adventure genre with the battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scramble Knights Royale - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMWryL7--F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game start you off with a steam boat that chuffs around the battle island, and when you choose to depart, you’ll surf on the back of a turtle to make it to land. From there, you’ll do all the Zelda-like things of grabbing loot, delving into dungeons and fighting bosses. That rewards you with better gear, secondary abilities, blacksmith upgrades and more.</p>
<p>It will eventually come to a head where you face off against the other players that have done the same in other parts of the world. Will you have grabbed enough upgrades and abilities to beat them?</p>
<p>Scramble Knights Royale has a claymation art style to go with the top-down view of the world, which looks delightful. The game is obviously online, but there’s also local split-screen, so you can team up on the same system. That’s pretty neat!</p>

<p>The game is still deep in development, but if this piqued your interest, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379350/Scramble_Knights_Royale/">ask to join the Steam Playtest</a> from its store page.</p>

            <p>
I am most certainly the kind of sucker that has few complaints about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> being split into multiple parts. Those are my guys! I love my grumpy idiot all too realistic looking Cloud, I think Midgar being so well realised helps to justify the splitting of the game, and as maximalist as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> is, there's a quality to it I can't help but admire, even with its many flaws. Keeping things fresh is still something necessary in dividing the game up though, and in a recent interview, director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke of how he's trying to do that with the as-of-yet untitled third part.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/JulienChieze/status/1997995919128559623">YouTube Julien Chièze</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-reached-a-stage-where-its-finally-starting-to-match-the-vision-i-had-for-it-director-teases-and-the-new-experience-is-almost-complete/">GamesRadar</a>), Hamaguchi noted that first of all, he "never intended to make a three-part series that would offer the same kind of experience each time. For the first game, the goal was to define what a remake actually is, and in the second title we added an open-world dimension to expand the scale of the experience." When it comes to the third game, the director noted the need to "implement a new experience and a new scale. And in that evolution, one of the key words is 'Highwind.'"
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi went on to explain that the "new experience the game will offer is almost complete," heading into the fleshing out phase. The entire game has even apparently hit a point where it's "starting" to match the director's vision, though very politely asks all of us to wait a tad longer for it, with the promise of more info coming "soon."
</p>
<p>
Whether that's Geoff's Night of Ads and a Few Statues soon, or Random Thursday in February soon, I haven't the foggiest. Mostly the question is whether us PC lot will be getting it the same time as everyone else. Square Enix did undergo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">quite a big internal shift within the last year</a>, outlining its intention for more multiplatform releases, so fingers crossed the gap won't be too wide.
