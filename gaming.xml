Epic Games has announced its Mega Sale 2024, which begins today and offers a free game each week. The offer kicks off with Dragon Age: Inquisition - Game of the Year Edition, which you can nab from the Epic Games Store now.
</p>
<p>
The offer of BioWare's brilliant RPG is well-timed, ahead of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> finally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-two-unannounced-games-to-launch-this-year-one-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf">arriving later this year</a>. Expect to see more of that very soon. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the Epic Mega Sale runs from now until 13th June with tons of discounts, including a 20% saving on last year's excellent Alan Wake 2, down to £32.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>release date, and it won't be long before you can enjoy the first game in the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>series since 2013.</p>
<p>The official website for the game <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was updated today</a>&nbsp;and now shows the release date, which is July 19th, along with a snippet of the artwork for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also now <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/buy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order</a>&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation or Xbox (no mention of a PC version, though), and doing so shows a preview of the cover art for both the standard and deluxe editions. Here's a look at the standard version:</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-cover-art.jpg?itok=B84cF6Bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-cover-art.jpg?itok=Xg9eHqUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>is finally almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>And here's a look at the artwork for the deluxe edition, which packs in a bunch of extras, including 3-day early access to the game:</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-deluxe-edition.jpg?itok=_16v2sJO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-deluxe-edition.jpg?itok=Y9bahRV2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of athletes will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long, strange road for&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. The franchise's last installment was 2013's <i>NCAA Football 14</i>, and following that game's release, EA, the CLC, and the NCAA were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-returning-in-coming-years">hit with lawsuits</a> surrounding player likenesses.</p>
<p>Essentially, players weren't being paid for their likenesses being in&nbsp;EA's games due to a rule instated by the NCAA, and a player brought a lawsuit against the companies in 2014, demanding royalties for his appearance in a game.</p>
<p>However, the NCAA ruled in 2019 that players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ncaa-paves-way-for-video-games-once-again">could profit</a> from their likenesses, thus paving the way for college sports video games to return.&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>&nbsp;is one such game, and it'll <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1764667866006102497" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feature more than 10,000 athletes</a>, according to EA Sports.</p>
<p>Reports originally suggested that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-still-targeting-summer-2023-release">slated for a 2023 release</a> and was delayed to 2024, but EA Sports' Daryl Holt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-delayed-to-2024">refuted those claims in an interview</a> in which he confirmed the game would launch this year.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 24&nbsp;</em>is set for a July 19th release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A full reveal is coming tomorrow, so stay tuned for more.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7TnlD3">We finally know when we’re going back to school: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074774/ea-sports-college-football-25-teaser-trailer"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a> is scheduled to launch July 19, publisher Electronic Arts announced Thursday.</p>
<p id="JcA7PN">EA also officially released the game’s cover artwork, which had leaked online last week, confirming that <em>College Football 25</em> will feature three <em>current</em> players on the box: Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter, and Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards.</p>
<p id="k6w5aT">This is the first time that active college athletes will grace the cover of an EA Sports game, EA said in a news release. And thanks to the new post-2021 landscape in college sports, where <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/news/2021/6/30/ncaa-adopts-interim-name-image-and-likeness-policy.aspx">athletes can be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness</a>, the game publisher is paying each of this year’s cover stars for the appearance. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dedwards___/p/C3qp5VMuXGe/">Edwards</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quinn_ewers/p/C3qioI_ul0H/">Ewers</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/db3_tip/p/C3qtHx6rDSg/">Hunter</a> have each published sponsored Instagram posts in partnership with the official EA Sports College Football account.)</p>
<p id="SVC6kr">Developed, as before, by Madden NFL studio EA Tiburon, the game will be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The lack of a Windows PC version is notable, since EA has been releasing Madden on PC since 2018. But it’s unlikely to dampen the anticipation and enthusiasm around <em>College Football 25</em> all that much, considering how long fans have been waiting for this beloved video game franchise to return.</p>

<p id="G2YlAz">It’s been more than a decade since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/26/4774542/ea-sports-ncaa-football-college-2014-canceled">EA shelved the series, then known as NCAA Football</a>, amid a flurry of class-action lawsuits alleging that EA, the NCAA, and the Collegiate Licensing Company (an organization representing the schools that appeared in the game) profited from their use of collegiate athletes’ likenesses without paying them. This arrangement existed due to long-standing NCAA bylaws that characterized the players as “student-athletes” — as opposed to professionals — and forbade them from receiving any compensation for the use of their names, images, or likenesses (NIL). In separate litigation, former college athletes alleged that this practice violated antitrust law.</p>
<p id="loioSm">EA, the NCAA, and the CLC agreed in 2014 to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/17/8991709/ea-sports-ncaa-player-likeness-lawsuit-settlement-approved">settlements totaling $60 million</a> for the use of athlete likenesses in video games, which resulted in payouts to thousands of former players who had “appeared” in EA’s college football and college basketball games. The antitrust litigation eventually ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in 2021 in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/6/21/22543598/supreme-court-ncaa-alston-student-athletes-football-basketball-sports-antitrust"><em>NCAA v. Alston</em></a> that the NCAA’s limits on compensation for athletes were illegal, while leaving in place policies that prevent them from being paid salaries. Shortly afterward, the NCAA announced an interim NIL policy, opening the floodgates for collegiate athletes to be able to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22559909/ncaa-college-football-nil-rules-pay-players-ea-sports-video-game">sign endorsement deals with companies such as EA</a>.</p>
<p id="2UV69c">While EA’s video game franchise no longer carries the NCAA name — the publisher rebranded it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/2/22262449/ea-sports-college-football-ncaa-players">EA Sports College Football</a> when it announced the series’ return in 2021 — it appears that <em>College Football 25</em> will include all the pomp and pageantry from college football, and the authenticity that people were accustomed to. EA said in its news release that the game will feature 134 colleges and universities from the NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision, meaning that players will be able to enjoy their favorite school’s uniforms, mascots, and stadiums as they did in EA’s previous games. And now that NIL deals are possible, <em>College Football 25</em>’s cover stars are among <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1764667866006102497">more than 10,000 collegiate athletes who have agreed to appear in the game</a>. EA is giving each one a minimum fee of $600, plus a copy of the game.</p>
<p id="8nk3s6">More details on <em>College Football 25</em> will be unveiled Friday, alongside a full trailer. </p>

Why? Because it’s undeniably perfect.</p><p>A lot of people are quick to point out that this casting wouldn’t even be that out there for the movie or DeVito. 2023’s <em>Super Mario Bros.

Even DeVito’s<em> It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em> co-star Charlie Day is in the movie as the voice of Luigi.</p><p>Animation studio Illumination also has a history of working with DeVito, first as the voice of the Lorax in 2012 and most recently as a voice in 2023’s <em>Migration</em>. But it seems like a lot of fans just want DeVito to embody the personality he brings to his <em>Always Sunny</em> character <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540">Frank</a></span>, which does fit the vibe of Wario.</p><p>But of course the real appeal is just DeVito himself being his own type of weirdo in the best way.

                <p>Activision, the gaming giant behind Call of Duty, has announced a new studio based in Europe--Elsewhere Entertainment--that is creating an "all-new franchise." This will be a "narrative-based IP," but the company did not confirm any further details on the project.</p><p>GameSpot understands this will not be a new Call of Duty project and that the team has been working quietly on the game for some time. Activision investing in a non-sequel or franchise extension is a big move, as the company has in recent years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">tripled down on Call of Duty. </a></p><p>Elsewhere Entertainment, based in Warsaw, Poland, is Activision's second studio in Poland, joining the Infinity Ward team in Krakow. Resources from Activision's US teams are working with Elsewhere.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304054-screenshot2024-05-16at8.45.00am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304054" data-ratio="0.56635672020287" data-width="2366" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304054-screenshot2024-05-16at8.45.00am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304054"></a><figcaption>Elsewhere Entertainment is coming into focus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304054-screenshot2024-05-16at8.45.00am.png"></figure><p>Activision is known best for its mega-franchise Call of Duty and hasn't published a new, original IP since Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in 2019. Prior to that, Activision published Bungie's Destiny series before Bungie bought the franchise back and split off from Activision (and was later acquired by Sony). </p><p>Elsewhere is staffed by people who worked on The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Destiny, The Division, and Far Cry, though Activision did not provide the names of any specific employees at the company. The studio is <a href="https://careers.activision.com/Elsewhere?utm_source=Elsewhere&amp;utm_medium=LinkedIn&amp;utm_campaign=ElsewhereEntertainmentCTA&amp;utm_id=Elsewhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actively hiring</a> for a variety of roles currently. It sounds like it's early days for this new Activision game, and there is no word yet on a release window or platforms, including whether or not it will be exclusive on console to Xbox given Activision's stance as a Microsoft-owned company.</p><p>Also worth noting is that Activision is now owned by Microsoft, so Elsewhere is part of the wider Microsoft umbrella. Microsoft has made headlines recently for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">mass layoffs and studio closures at Xbox.</a> </p><p>In other Activision news, many are expecting the company to announce the next Call of Duty game soon. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">widely expected that Treyarch is making the next Black Ops game</a>, and if history repeats itself, the game could be teased within Warzone before its public debut. Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase in June will be followed by a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-airs-june-9-followed-by-mystery-event/1100-6523072/" data-ref-id="1100-6523072">mystery event that could be a dedicated broadcast for the next Call of Duty. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-it-means-to-direct-a-game-that-was-someone-else-s-creative-vision<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lessons-from-the-founding-of-ironwood-studios">a very personal project</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for Ironwood Studios founder Alexander Dracott. He conceived the game based on his own experience driving around the ominous back roads of Washington's Olympic Peninsula. He daydreamed about what such a drive might look like with spooky mysterious beings floating about in the woods, and when the time came to start his own studio, he jumped on the chance to bring his dream to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game is an impressive creative and technical feat. It's a driving game that makes driving approachable for players who'd shy away from the Gran Turismo or Forza franchises. It uses </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-exceptionally-cool-ways-pacific-drive-used-randomized-terrain-to-shape-player-goals">procedural generation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to create randomized terrain on a small budget. And thanks to hard work from the talented development team, learning about both the creepy game world and the ins and outs of maintaining your beat-up station wagon feel equally delightful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To pull off those intricate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-survival-roguelike-design-fundamentals-that-fuel-pacific-drive">design challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Ironwood turned to game designer Seth Rosen. Rosen cut his teeth on games like Hangar 13's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Klei Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don't Starve Together</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He'd drifted out of day-to-day game development in favor of consulting and lecturing at NYU, but jumped onto the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team after a productive session where he explained how Ironwood could improve the gameplay of maintaining and upgrading the player's car.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-the-game-industry-must-do-to-prevent-occupational-burnout" target="_self">What the game industry must do to prevent occupational burnout</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In time, Rosen took on the role of game director, while Dracott became creative director. His job title made for a fascinating question: what does it mean to be "game director" on a project that's someone's personal vision?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a conversation hosted by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev/">Boston GameDev</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in April (led by the author of this piece), Rosen offered a transparent answer to that question: "it was a challenge for a long time," he said. His transparency on the topic shed light on what can be a difficult topic in game development: how to navigate disagreements while treating each other with respect in the workplace.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sharing leadership duties was a &quot;challenge&quot; for Rosen and Dracott">Sharing leadership duties was a "challenge" for Rosen and Dracott</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There were moments on the project where there wasn't...not necessarily a power struggle, but just uncertainty for the team about who to listen to," Rosen recalled. He admitted the dynamic sometimes made other team members "uncomfortable," as they'd sometimes be looking back and forth between the two men as they looked for direction on how to do their work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn't until spring of 2023 that he and Dracott formally split directing roles. Making that split solved a number of leadership and scope-driven challenges. With a team of only about 18 employees (and varying numbers of contractors), it was becoming hard for every developer at Ironwood Studios to be involved with every part of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an email exchange, Dracott affirmed the need to split the roles, saying the game needed "both high level birds eye view of the project and a detailed perspective."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As creative director, Dracott would supervise all decisions with regard to the game world, the atmosphere, the narrative, and the overall "vibe." Rosen would get into the nitty gritty of gameplay, but all of his decisions would be done in service of the creative pillars Dracott had set down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It took a number of "honest and raw, but ultimately respectful" conversations to get to that point. One early divide between the two leads had to do with the height and view distance the player had while sitting in the car, looking out the front windshield. "Early on, the viewpoint of the car was even higher up and [the player] had less view of the world," he said. That was because the car was designed to recreate Dracott's beloved station wagon that inspired the game in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was really important to [Dracott] that we really hit the vibe of that car and match it as much as we legally could."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only problem: sitting at that viewpoint didn't feel great for the player. Rosen wanted players to sit lower and have a longer view of the road ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair argued about this for "hours and hours" without coming to a firm decision. To bridge the gap, the team at Ironwood had to nudge the camera around the car's interior and tweak the physical length of the hood to preserve the needs of both leads. Both of them had to reckon with the fact that there wasn't a perfect solution—just one that made the game better.</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Solving such problems was only possible because the pair maintained "respect" for each other (even when "tempers flared"). Dracott echoed a similar sentiment in our follow-up exchange. "With two folks in such pivotal roles and their own skillsets, it does mean that sometimes we did have differing opinions," he wrote in reflection. "But with the aligned goal of what is best for the game, and the creative pillars we had set out to be in place for the project as a guiding star, it meant that ultimately in the big picture we were always aligned."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen also said both of them worked hard to keep arguments impersonal. "Our frustrations may build, but ultimately we're not passing judgment on the other, we're just trying to advocate for the best thing for the game," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seems like an obvious fact, but making arguments impersonal isn't a guarantee in game development. This creative industry often prioritizes brutally honest feedback, framed around the idea that developers need to know everything wrong with their work in order to fix it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Helping employees at Pacific Drive share effective feedback was important to maintaining that mutual respect. Rosen described "mentoring" members of the team, saying the biggest goal for him was to try and always "place the feedback on [himself.]"</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">"You try to say 'this is the experience that I had, how it made me feel, and the these are the things that didn't click for me," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such descriptions can cushion the blow softer than directly criticizing what's onscreen—it depersonalizes the feedback and allows developers to look at their work and assess what can be done to solve legitimate problems. "You're not passing judgment on the [feature], you're talking about the results it's creating."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Surprise, you're the lead producer now too">Surprise, you're the lead producer now too</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Glance at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s credits and you'll see another role Rosen took on: that of "interim producer." As development progressed, Ironwood Studios was preparing itself to adapt for the brief absence of the team's only producer Alyssa Askew, who had scheduled time off for maternity leave around the estimated end of her pregnancy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then the baby came three months early. (Don't worry, Rosen reported that the baby is healthy.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team had been preparing to shift Askew's responsibilities elsewhere in the project, but that shift now had to happen three months early, with seven deliverables owed to publisher Kepler Interactive (the team had been preparing to ship in November 2023, and this surprise role swap took place in July).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was getting pretty spicy pretty fast," Rosen said. "I was doing everything I could to keep folks moving in a productive direction."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result was a sprint-based production process that worked—but didn't work perfectly. The two weeks check-ins were loosely aligned with the target milestones, but estimating the amount of time it would take to complete a needed feature was difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Rosen and the engineering team had to scramble to make sure all the tools were in place so other developers could keep working. "My priority was to make sure people have enough work to stay busy until I could figure out what their actual work was," he said. If any kind of logjam surfaced in the production pipeline, it would have left some Ironwood employees spinning their wheels as their deadlines inched closer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately, Kepler offered the team an extension to March 2024, and Ironwood Studios got some much-needed breathing room. But earning that extra time came with a price—sprinting to the November deadline left some team members burned out with only enough energy to work through the backlog of tasks and bugs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get to the finish line, Rosen needed to "right-size" the amount of work that needed to be done, constantly reprioritizing what was in the backlog so that the most high-value parts of the game were being worked on at all times. "No game is ever done, it just gets released," he quipped.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Killing some people's fun in game development">Killing some people's fun in game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Rosen leading the design of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and Dracott leading the creative vision, who was in charge of the technical and engineering elements of the game? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't list any lead engineers in the credits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen again shouldered much of this work—but not perfectly. Luckily he was a former computer science student and came with experience partnering with triple-A developers at Hangar 13 on the heavily systems-driven elements of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia III </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the "immersive sim" elements of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That meant he had a lot of expertise in what tools designers would need for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And that he rolled into development with robust spec requests for the team to execute on. Seems simple enough, right?</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wrong. (Nothing in game development is simple. Our readers know this.) The challenge that Rosen dealt with wasn't necessarily technical in nature. He described there being "tension" with some of his engineering colleagues because they didn't feel as though they had agency in determining how their work was going. But Rosen felt the team didn't have time to "explore" such tools because the team hopped right from prototyping into full production.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His requests weren't necessarily handed down from on high—he described regularly adjusting his requests based on feedback from the folks doing the programming. But leading the engineering team with this method eliminated what he called "the fun part of game development" for his peers. There wasn't any time to experiment or play around with unique technical solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It meant that team had less opportunity to "feel excited" about their work because Rosen was cutting out the joy of seeking solutions. In a way, he had to act against the design of the very game he was directing. He wanted players to explore the limits of the game world—but needed to dictate answers to the programming team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Going forward, it's something that I definitely want to adjust," he said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Leadership is a heavy burden to bear">Leadership is a heavy burden to bear</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fair to say that Rosen didn't get everything right as a game director. But he, Dracott, and their colleagues, did make a fantastic game unlike anything we at Game Developer have ever seen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you have a narrow vision of leadership then you might say the ends justified the means. But if you're a leader who wants to improve—as Rosen seemed to be—you're willing to look at your past decisions with a critical eye and assess what worked and what didn't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen and other industry leaders must make such assessments knowing their decisions don't just impact the game, but the people making it. It's their decisions that can </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-the-game-industry-must-do-to-prevent-occupational-burnout">lead to burnout</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or drive people away from the studio. And it's not just about preventing crunch—it's about ensuring healthy work environments and keeping people inspired and motivated to give their best in the workplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dracott praised Rosen for taking on such challenges, saying that the two men's development styles were "complementary," and made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "the game it is today."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm forever appreciative of the collaboration I had with Seth over the course of development, and he's helped me grow during my time running Ironwood," he wrote. "The game would not be the same without him."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks to Rosen's candor, other aspiring directors can study what improvements they can make as they step into leadership roles.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="305" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s still a little odd to see celebrities tweeting about <em>Fortnite</em>, but Doja Cat certainly wasn’t afraid to make her opinion known on X, formerly Twitter, writing that Epic Games needs to ditch the Chains of Hades, and claiming that anyone who uses them are “horrible and garbage.”</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">We’ve all played games where we’ve been so infuriated by something or someone that our first reaction is to jump on social media and just go in. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve tried to stop myself from doing it, but I don’t blame those who do, like Doja Cat on May 15. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="663" data-injectable="true">In a pair of now-deleted tweets, the “Say So” singer wrote that “If <em>Fortnite</em> knew what was good for them, they’d get rid of the Chains of Hades,” then suggesting that “if you’re horrible and garbage at <em>Fortnite</em>, make sure you grab a Chains of Hades whip to pass the time,” labeling those who use them “dumb.”</p>

 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">It’s well-known that Doja Cat is a <em>Fortnite</em> player, and has both tweeted about and streamed the game in the past.

It’s unknown if the issue is “Doja Cat roasted us on Twitter,” but I like to believe it was.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/turtle-rock-not-making-more-back-4-blood-content-next-game-news/">Turtle Rock Studios isn’t making more content</a> for its FPS zombie shooter <em>Back 4 Blood</em>, the <em>Left 4 Dead</em>-esque spiritual successor is still getting some attention. This is evidenced by the fact that not only has the game had a small update recently, but Denuvo has also been removed.</p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">As noted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/924970/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>, a change which occurred yesterday spells it out in black and white: “Removed 3rd-Party DRM,” referring specifically to Denuvo. The hugely unpopular anti-tamper software is often considered the bane of PC gaming. However, it feels weird that it’s been taken out of something that was released at the tail end of 2021.</p> <figure data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[UPDATE] We just rolled out a minor game update that addresses an Easy Anti-Cheat issue for Steam Deck users where players could not access the game. Please allow 1-2 hours for the Steam Deck fix to be rolled out.</p>— Turtle Rock Studios (@TurtleRock) <a href="https://twitter.com/TurtleRock/status/1790790345854181863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">At two and a half years old, and with just <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/924970/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 2,500 people currently playing</a> at the time of writing, it feels a little late for <em>Back 4 Blood</em> to do away with DRM. While studios and publishers have been known to remove the offending software post-launch, it’s typically done a bit sooner. One recent example I can point to is <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lies-of-p-parts-ways-with-denuvo/">Lies of P</a></em>, which took Denuvo out just a few months after the game’s release.</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/924970/view/4190114399255052787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new patch</a> it’s been referred to as a “minor game update,” and puts emphasis on some issues with the Easy Anti-Cheat system. Maybe this explains why Denuvo was removed entirely, but I’m speculating.</p> <h2 id="h-what-could-have-been" data-injectable="false">What could have been</h2> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">Look, I’m just going to say it: I actually liked <em>Back 4 Blood</em>. I know it underdelivered what it initially promised, and it was pretty buggy on release, but it made me (sort of) rekindle my yearned-for <em>Left 4 Dead</em> days.</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">I feel it is a bit unfair to say the developer missed the mark entirely. Its four-player campaign mechanics, having random hordes of zombies (or The Ridden, as they were called), chance encounters with Special Infected enemies, and an emphasis on team-based combat were reminiscent of Valve’s legendary shooter.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">It is a bit of a shame it didn’t quite pan out how we all hoped, but I like to think it was at least a valiant effort. Yeah, it had a frustrating difficulty curve and the AI companions left much to be desired, but I got a few months of joy out of it.</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">It’s also showing as “Mostly Positive” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> in terms of recent reviews, so it’s not all bad. It’s hard to say what Turtle Rock is working on next. All we can hope is the studio doesn’t overpromise on its next project. Don’t – for example – market it as the “next <em>Half-Life</em>” or something.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-exotic-khvostov-looks-like-a-proper-delight/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-the-final-shapes-exotic-khvostov-looks-like-a-proper-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="312" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s auto rifle weapon category is a bit of an acquired taste. Weaker than the SMGs (<em>how</em>?) and less potent at range than the pulse rifles, these guns are a tad awkward but snazzy nonetheless. It’s this snazziness, specifically, that <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X is banking on.</p> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">The Khvostov 7G-0X has just received a cool little video showcase as part of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s pre-release promotional campaign, and it’s safe to say that this is an entirely different gun than it was <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Khvostov_7G-0X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in <em>Destiny 1</em></a>. Notably, the first <em>Destiny</em> played host to a baseline Khvostov 7G-02, which is present in basically identical form in <em>Destiny 2</em> as well, as the player Guardian’s first weapon. The first <em>Destiny</em>‘s 7G-0X, however, was a highly customizable, questionably useful, and unquestionably delightful-looking reskin of the base model. Not so with the new version, as veterans will immediately spot.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Khvostov Exotic Auto Rifle Preview | Destiny 2: The Final Shape [UK]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJOQsQWrHRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-khvostov-7g-0x-comes-with-a-whole-new-perk-and-model-this-time-around" data-injectable="false">Khvostov 7G-0X comes with a whole new Perk and model, this time around</h2> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">Whereas the old iteration of the Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X allowed Guardians to tweak and tune the gun to their own preference, the new 7G-0X is a wholly different beast from the looks of it. Its flexibility, for one, has seemingly been replaced with a unique round ricochet perk, which says that every seventh shot the gun fires will bounce off into a nearby enemy. Neat, albeit obviously a far cry from the original Exotic’s schtick.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The model of the weapon, too, is entirely new. This time around, it seemingly reflects the Khvostov’s Golden Age roots, being a high-tech piece of kit that few could’ve gotten their hands on. The silhouette is highly reminiscent of a mutated M16, of all things, though the carry handle-looking bit is in fact an overdesigned and overbuilt reflex sight protector.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="849" data-injectable="false">All in all, there’s precious little to complain about so far, though we’ll obviously have to wait and see how the 7G-0X performs in practice to say whether it has a place in the current meta. Remember: <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">auto rifles are getting a hefty 15% damage buff</a> across the board in PvE, and this could help them stand out in <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s immense gear arsenal. Auto rifle enjoyers rejoice, especially now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our old, previously sunset weapons will be viable once again</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-not-always-online<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has clarified that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>won't require an online connection to play, although you won't technically be able to play the game without being online at least once.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1791095143799414951" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Ubisoft says that an online connection will be needed to install&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, but that once the game is installed, you'll be able to play "the entire journey" offline.</p>
<p>Presumably, this applies to both the digital version and physical version of the game, so no matter where you buy&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, you will need to be online during the initial installation process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-always-online-naoe.jpg?itok=ha529ww5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-always-online-naoe.jpg?itok=NZB10d_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>won't need an online connection to play, but it's not quite that simple.</figcaption></figure><p>This post was made in response to users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ct4kgh/assassins_creed_shadows_to_be_online_only/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speculating</a> that&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>would be an always-online game, apparently based on its PlayStation Store listing, which <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/looks-like-assassins-creed-shadows-is-an-online-only-title-up-the-game-is-playable-offline.871923/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously stated</a> that online play would be required.</p>
<p>That listing has now been changed, however, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA20396_00-GAME000000000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">current PlayStation Store page</a> for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>confirms that online play is "optional" (although, again, being online for the initial install will be mandatory).</p>
<p>Fans' consternation was perhaps understandable given the controversy surrounding&nbsp;<em>The Crew</em>, an always-online Ubisoft game for which the servers were recently shut down, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rendering it unplayable</a>.</p>
<p>That's still a concern given that it looks like the physical&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>disc won't be enough to grant you access to the game in perpetuity, but at least you won't need to be online to play once the install is complete.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-always-online-yasuke-samurai.jpg?itok=A4uEVwsk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-always-online-yasuke-samurai.jpg?itok=NrMKiX_I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been installed, you're free to enjoy it offline.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date">latest mainline installment</a> in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. Set in feudal Japan, the game will follow two protagonists: shinobi assassin Naoe and real-life historical samurai Yasuke.</p>
<p>Both protagonists will be playable throughout the story and it looks like you'll be switching between them in a similar manner to Jacob and Evie Frye in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</em>.</p>
<p>Yasuke's playstyle is much more aggressive; he's a combat-focused character with whom you'll be kicking down doors and swinging giant hammers. Naoe, meanwhile, prefers a sneakier, quieter approach to missions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>on PC, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA20396_00-GAME000000000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> when it launches on November 15th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>Guerrilla Games' Horizon series is about to get an unexpected new entry called LEGO Horizon Adventures, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, this new entry in the series, which was previously revealed by Kurakasis on<a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1789233776456872005"> X/Twitter</a>, will essentially be Horizon Forbidden West but with LEGO aesthetics and likely some gameplay tweaks. Interestingly enough, the game is said to have "realistic graphics" which suggests it may feature a different visual style compared to other LEGO games on the market. As for when the game could be officially announced, no one can say. An advertisement trailer was reportedly completed last month, so the reveal should be imminent, possibly during Sony's rumored May showcase.</p>
<p>With LEGO Horizon Adventures playing similarly to the latest main entry in the series, Horizon Forbidden West, there's no better time to experience Aloy's latest adventure before the new game's release. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>Horizon Forbidden West is a worthy sequel to Zero Dawn in every way, proving that Guerrilla is no one-hit wonder when it comes to the action RPG genre. This huge and beautiful world has an incredible amount of things to do and most of them are really fun, thanks to improvements to combat and traversal. The game also features another great storyline that will get fans talking about the inevitable sequel.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2024/5/16/24156963/best-game-play-tonight-recommendations-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EvVJYA">One of the best parts of our jobs at Polygon is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play">recommending awesome new games to play</a>. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151036/best-indie-games-2024">indie games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151983/best-cozy-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">cozy games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24144632/best-board-games-2024-new">board games</a>, or just the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24078256/best-video-games-2024">best of the year</a>, we’re always trying to introduce readers to new and exciting picks. Lists are a great way to share a variety of games in a short amount of time. But sometimes it’s fun to do something more personally curated.</p>
<p id="YXwJDF">That’s why we have this regular open thread dedicated to helping you, our dear readers, find the perfect game to play right now. Looking for a narrative-rich sci-i epic that will have you fight the techno embodiment of god? We’ve got you. Want a five-minute distraction to break up the daily grind? We’ve got you there too.</p>
<p id="DQEOOH">From 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I will be in the comments section down below answering your questions and fielding requests for what you should play. We previously programmed this as a weekly movie column but will be moving that version to a monthly schedule with more, non-movie recommendation threads coming your way week over week. </p>
<p id="bPgMdP">I should add that this is also a great place to share what <em>you’ve been playing</em>, if you want to talk about that with your fellow Polygon readers! Participation is very welcome, even without questions.</p>
<p id="7Nj4Qf">A little bit about me, your curator for this go-round: I’m Chris Plante, Polygon’s editor-in-chief. Alongside my time at Polygon, I host a video game podcast called The Besties with my colleague Russ Frushtick and my buddies Justin and Griffin McElroy. And years ago, I created NYU’s first course on video game journalism. More recently, I’ve been helping out at my local art house movie theater! I’m a pop culture omnivore, as happy to savor a cheeky <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/9/16849562/universal-paperclips-best-games-2017-year-in-review">critique of artificial intelligence</a> as I am to scarf down that latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111190/MULLET_MADJACK/">gory first-person shooter</a>.</p>
<p id="LrTWHM">What am I playing right now? I took a short trip to Austin, TX last week, and I spent my flights chopping baddies to bits with a human-sized axe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses"><em>Hades 2</em></a>. I’m also enjoying the puzzle-heavy Metroidvania <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, the poker roguelike <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24084564/balatro-review-poker-game-deck-building-roguelite"><em>Balatro</em></a>, the twin-stick shooters/Zelda-like hybrid<em> Minishoot’ Adventures</em>, and plenty of other games big and small. Surely, I’ll find someone to recommend Snufkin to!</p>
<p id="5g2ors">Now it’s time to turn it around to you. What would you like to play this weekend (or what are you planning to play)? Leave a request in the comments and I’ll get to it between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. EDT. Details help — let me know what you’re looking for, some idea of your taste as a viewer, and any other relevant info you feel like sharing (like the streaming services you have access to, or what it was about the show you’re looking to emulate, if anything).</p>
<p id="KteWau">Here are two examples of good queries from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2024/5/9/24150607/best-tv-watch-tonight-recommendations-streaming">last week’s TV edition</a>:</p>


<p id="1dVc3d">See you in the comments at 3:30 p.m. EDT! Fire away your requests in the meantime.</p>

But we’re almost four years into the PlayStation 5’s life, and it still only accounts for half of Sony’s audience. The influx of service games like <em>Fortnite</em> means that some PS4 users only keep a PSN account open to play one game and don’t need to upgrade to PS5. However, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortals-of-aveum-budget-aaa-single-player-shooter-1851252502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortals-of-aveum-budget-aaa-single-player-shooter-1851252502">video game budgets balloon</a></span> and companies become more risk averse, leaving half the active audience behind becomes a more difficult proposition.</p><p>Sony seems to have also recognized that, at this stage, it’s leaving money on the table by only releasing games on PS5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xivs-fantasia-system-gets-a-redo-option-plus-one-free-potion-to-try/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=final-fantasy-xivs-fantasia-system-gets-a-redo-option-plus-one-free-potion-to-try<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="320" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For those players who are never satisfied with a Fantasia makeover for long, <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>is implementing a ‘redo’ button of sorts. During the Letter from the Producer Live 81, director and producer Naoki Yoshida revealed the Fantasia system is getting some updates, and a new way to get a free potion. </p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">When<em> Dawntrail </em>releases on July 2 — June 28 for early access — a new low-level quest will be added in Ul’dah, which not only teaches players how Fantasia works but also provides all players who complete it with a free Phial of Fantasia to use as they wish. During the Live Letter, Naoki Yoshida said he hopes that players will use this free potion to experiment with the Character Creation aspect of <em>FFXIV</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">More excitingly, though, after using a Phial of Fantasia, players will now have a 60-minute window of game time in order to make further tweaks to their character. This means that any decisions you make while inside the Character Creator screen will not be final, allowing you to experiment not only with small tweaks but also providing an opportunity to test out other races.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">There is no limit to the number of times players will be able to access the Character Creation menu during this time, though the time doesn’t reset after each editing session. The 60-minute window is based on game time, so if you log out, the timer pauses, and you can go away and allow yourself time to get used to your new look.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="false">This change comes as a response to player feedback, with players saying that they wanted to see their character in action to fully appreciate any changes that are made while using Fantasia. It’s a big change for folks dissatisfied with how lighting, weather, and other in-game effects change their Warrior of Light’s appearance outside of the customization menu. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/los-angeles-chargers-win-the-nfl-release-schedule-meme-wars-with-a-maniacal-sims-video.872799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158120/los-angeles-chargers-the-sims-schedule-release-meme<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YfNtNM">The Los Angeles Chargers have chosen to begin their announcement of the NFL schedule in the most incredible way: Putting a bunch of other teams’ fans in a swimming pool and removing the ladder — in <em>The Sims 2</em>, of course. </p>
<p id="ZwQw1V">You may remember the Chargers’ schedule release video from last year, when the social media team <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23071055/chargers-anime-nfl-schedule-release-video-attack-on-titan-one-piece">made the schedule into an anime</a>, complete with references to <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Naruto</em>, and <em>Attack on Titan</em>. Largely, schedule release videos have been extremely boring — it’s literally just the 17-game schedule for the upcoming season, put into video format. NFL teams <em>are</em> trying to inject pop culture into the mix, like when the Detroit Lions put their <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/8/21252109/detroit-lions-2020-nfl-schedule-announcement-animal-crossing-new-horizons">schedule in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, and schedule release season is turning into a meme war. The Chargers are one team that routinely excels, and the <em>Sims 2</em> video makes this year no different.</p>
<div id="1ZPyod">
<blockquote>
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>should we REALLY make our schedule release video in the sims?</p><p>yes          yes          yesyes<br>yesyes    yes      yes         yes<br>yes  yes  yes     yes           yes<br>yes    yesyes     yes           yes<br>yes      yesye      yes        yes<br>yes          yes           yesyes <a href="https://t.co/MXzfAPyhe8">pic.twitter.com/MXzfAPyhe8</a></p></div>— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) <a href="https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1790895458581467314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="1uAObl">There are so many incredible Easter eggs throughout the whole video. It’s got Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce; New York Jets quarterback and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/nyregion/aaron-rodgers-jets-podcasts.html">famed conspiracy theorist</a> Aaron Rodgers recoiling from a cellphone tower; Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker in the kitchen <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/chiefs-player-harrison-butker-wants-women-to-stay-in-the-kitchen">following a misogynistic, homophobic commencement speech</a>; and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nflonfox/video/7225036534603517230?">George Pickens watching himself getting drafted</a> (also featuring the box of stolen <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/sports/shipment-jaromir-jagr-bobbleheads-stolen-postponing">Pittsburgh Penguins Jaromir Jágr bobbleheads</a>). That’s literally not even the half of it, so you’re going to <a href="https://twitter.com/ChargersMuse/status/1790914073196155163">want to watch and analyze for yourself</a>.</p>
<p id="fhMLXm">It’s the clear frontrunner for release videos this year, but several other NFL teams had fun referencing pop culture. The Atlanta Falcons turned their schedule release video into <a href="https://twitter.com/AtlantaFalcons/status/1790895094356177373"><em>ATL Streets Vol. ’24</em></a>, a play on <em>NFL Street</em> from 2004. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaguars/status/1790896080793616492">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> went with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157229/x-men-97-spider-man-animated-series-finale">reference to <em>X-Men ’97</em></a>, while the Seattle Seahawks <a href="https://twitter.com/Seahawks/status/1790912454031233535">did a fun comic book style announcement</a>.</p>
<p id="R26VEg">But has anyone lived up to the Chargers social media team’s schedule release legacy? My guess is no.</p>

<p>Following a rather rough year from Xbox, many of us eagerly await their redemption arc. Will Xbox turn things around and pump out exceptional games on its consoles and PC? Only time will tell, but the first glimpse of that happening is at the Xbox Showcase date coming soon!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-xbox-showcase-take-place">When Does the Xbox Showcase Take Place?</h2>



<p>The official Xbox Games Showcase begins on June 9, during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>, and will kick off at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST. Like last year’s showcase, Xbox intends to show off additional upcoming titles, like with the Starfield Direct, in a follow-up showcase. They’re not telling anyone what title we’ll see, but they did state it was “the next installment of a beloved franchise.”</p>



<p>Personally, I hope they’re alluding to State of Decay 3. Three years ago, we saw the first teaser trailer, with the woman hunting a zombified deer in the snowy woods. More than likely, however, they’re talking about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a>, which, as rumor has it, we’ll see more of at this summer’s showcase.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-the-xbox-showcase">What Games Will We See at the Xbox Showcase?</h2>



<p>Last year, during the Xbox Games Showcase, we saw titles such as Avowed, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-available-ps5-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. But this year, we’ll likely see:</p>



<ul>
<li>Starfield: Shattered Space</li>



<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</li>



<li>Avowed</li>
</ul>



<p>We’d love to see more on the upcoming Fable and State of Decay 3. Word on the gaming streets is that Microsoft intends to reveal the next Gears of War during the event.</p>

<p>While we all eagerly await the Xbox Games Showcase, check out what Insider Gaming is up to lately:</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>We have details of the first speakers and contributors to next month's GI Sprint.</p>
<p>GI Sprint is a series of videos, podcasts and articles all about ways we can make video games cheaper, faster and better. It will run from June 17th – July 5th,</p>
<p>The series will cover topics such as AI, cloud, team synergy, hybrid and remote working, distributed development, failing fast and much more.</p>
<p>The event will begin with a video podcast and interview with <strong>Shawn Layden, current strategic advisor to Tencent</strong> and former Chairman of PlayStation's studio business, and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment's US arm. Layden has been talking about the growing unsustainability of game development for over half a decade, and will share his views on the situation and identify areas where games studios can make time savings.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <strong>TeamSync's Graham McAllister</strong> will share early insight from his research into team synergy, including the importance of getting things right at the concept stage, in order to deliver games faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ant Workshop's Tony Gowland, Free Lives' Dominique Gawlowski,  Play 3arabi's Samer Abbas </strong>and indie development <strong>legend Rami Ismail </strong>will form part of a panel discussing the art of 'failing fast'.</p>
<p>In terms of AI, <strong>Sahar Asdai, Director of AI Labs at King</strong>, will share the impact AI testing has had on the Candy Crush series. Meanwhile, a wider AI panel featuring <strong>Didimo's Sean Cooper</strong>, <strong>AI and Games' Tommy Thompson</strong> and more to be announced, will also take place.</p>
<p>All sessions will also be released as GamesIndustry.biz articles, and collected together in a special GI Sprint white paper, which will be released in July (and free to download for all).</p>
<p>More speakers and contributors will be announced in the coming weeks including a series of sponsored sessions. For sponsorship enquiries, please contact <a href="mailto:Hannah.Potter@gamesindustry.biz">Hannah.Potter@gamesindustry.biz</a> or <a href="mailto:george.corner@gamesindustry.biz">George.Corne@Gamesindustry.bi</a>z.</p>

        <p>Report also says that more than half of adults aged over 18 play games regularly</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>More than 190 million people in the US played video games for at least one hour a week in 2023, according to new data from the Entertainment Software Association.</p>
<p>The ESA's 2024 Essential Facts About the Video Game Industry report was conducted in October 2023 by YouGov, including data from 5,000 respondents. .</p>
<p>It found that the average American player is 36 years old, and the average adult player has been playing games for almost two decades.</p>
<p>The ESA found that 53% of respondents identified as male and 46% identified as female. By comparison, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/esa-48-percent-of-video-game-players-are-female-and-29-percent-identify-as-people-of-color">2022's gender breakdown</a> saw 52% of those surveyed identify as male and 48% of players identify as female.</p>
<p>38% of game players were people of colour, which has increased by about a third from data collected in 2022.</p>
<p>More than half of adults 18 and older (56%) said they played games regularly, but it was the generation aged between five and ten that had the highest percentage of gamers at 79%.</p>
<p>The report also included retrospective facts to mark the ESA's 30th anniversary, including the growth of industry sales in the past 25 years.  In 2002, the industry reported $11.7 billion in consumer spending, while in 2023 this totaled $57.2 billion.</p>
<p>"Video games have been a fixture in American life and culture for generations," said Stanley Pierre-Louis, president and CEO of the ESA. "Players of all ages, backgrounds and abilities are embracing the positivity that video games bring to their lives."</p>
<p>"While the games we play – and how we play them – evolves over time, what remains consistent is how video games enhance our lives in ways that inspire us and bring us closer together."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/16/you-can-play-all-of-assassins-creed-shadows-offline-but-you-need-a-connection-to<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>You will need an internet connection to install <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer-confirms-dual-samurai-and-shinobi">dual samurai and shinobi protagonists</a> we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1791095143799414951">statement</a> reads. "<strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times</strong>.<strong> An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S,&nbsp;Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.</p>

<p>For more, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer-confirms-dual-samurai-and-shinobi">check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal</a>, and then read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/12/13/ranking-the-entire-assassin-s-creed-series.aspx"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-known-issues-launch-turn-10-bugs-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Motorsport</a></em> has been making some serious strides forward as of late, believe it or not. Between <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsports-car-progression-rework-is-now-out-and-its-a-huge-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improved progression mechanics</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-update-8-adds-improved-vinyl-editor-better-ai-updated-safety-ratings-and-heaps-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-promises-massive-improvements-2024-key-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general content</a>, Turn 10 has been putting in work to make things better, and fixing car models is now on the docket, too, believe it or not.</p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">For those who are not in the know, and not the biggest deal in the grand scheme of things, some of the <em>Forza</em> games’ legacy vehicle models are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/1cs35hw/theyre_going_to_remodel_cars/l44exib/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rather inaccurate</a> when compared to their real-world counterparts. <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, too, is way better in this regard than either of the contemporary <em>Forza</em> titles, and fans have been asking for Turn 10 and Playground Games to fix things up for quite a while now. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">Now, out of the blue, Turn 10 confirmed it <em>is</em> working on updating its vehicle model library, with almost a dozen classics already on the docket for a fix. The downside? These updates aren’t coming anytime soon, and they won’t be implemented into the current <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, either.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-turn-10-confirms-that-legacy-forza-car-models-will-be-fixed-in-future-games" data-injectable="false">Turn 10 confirms that legacy Forza car models will be fixed… in future games</h2> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Turn 10’s plans for <em>Forza Motorsport</em> have been to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGIT4ABa_Ak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make it a long-lasting live-service game</a>, and though the game is now substantially better than it was on day one, it seems it still won’t be getting <em>all</em> of the team’s planned tech and content upgrades after all. So far, Turn 10 has confirmed that the future <em>Forza</em> games will receive updated and accurized representations of the following vehicles:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li>BMW M3 E30 (1992)</li> <li>Dodge Viper GTS ACR (1999)</li> <li>Ferrari 575M Maranello (2002)</li> <li>Ford Focus RS (2003)</li> <li>Mazda RX-7 FD3S (1997)</li> <li>Mitsubishi Lancer EVO VI MR (1999)</li> <li>Nissan Silvia Spec-R S15 (2000)</li> <li>Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 V-Spec (1993)</li> <li>Toyota Sprinter Trueno Apex AE86 (1985)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">Kudos to Redditor red_fuel for <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/1cs35hw/theyre_going_to_remodel_cars/l42kec6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their list</a>! It is, of course, disappointing to hear that the current live-service <em>Forza Motorsport</em> isn’t likely to receive up-to-date models of these cars, but Turn 10’s reasoning is understandable in its own right.</p>
 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">Notably, the team’s comment explains how finding a museum-quality car they need to scan is non-trivial by default, and that’s without taking into account all the licensing and technical issues that come part and parcel with the job. Heck, even the inevitable <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> might not be privy to some of these updates, depending on how hard it is to source some of the faulty vehicle models.</p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">That’s not to say that <em>Forza Motorsport</em> hasn’t already made improvements in this area, either. Some car models, such as the legendary Impreza 22B, have been updated to better reflect their real-world inspirations, and this is bound to have thrilled fellow car aficionados when they discovered it:</p> <figure data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="false">I have bemoaned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-forza-community-maintains-a-massive-car-manufacturer-color-spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza</em>‘s car paint shader</a> before, so it stands to reason that I’m fairly nitpicky when it comes to real-world car representation as well. Certainly, the news that Turn 10’s hard work updating all the problematic models isn’t likely to be reflected in <em>Forza Motorsport</em> is disappointing, but I myself am happy to hear that the franchise’s roster of car models <em>will</em> inevitably be improved and iterated upon. For the time being, that’s good enough!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/every-hades-2-hot-spring-companion-and-how-to-get-them/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=every-hades-2-hot-spring-companion-and-how-to-get-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="208" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You can’t spend eternity just hacking away at <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-is-a-magical-massive-early-access-worth-getting-into-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a></em>; sometimes, you will need to relax a little bit as well. Thankfully, the hot spring is there for you and a companion to enjoy when things get tense.</p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">The best thing about bringing someone to the hot springs is that you can have a conversation with them you would not otherwise witness, and get some additional lore about each character, as well as further developing your relationship with them. Given that the strength of the writing and character building is always a core part of Supergiant Games’ work, you can bet this will be quite rewarding over time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-which-characters-can-you-bring-to-the-hot-tub-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">Which characters can you bring to the hot tub in Hades 2?</h2> <p data-characters="615" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><strong>So far, Dora, Eris, Hecate, Odysseus, Nemesis, and Moros</strong> can all be brought to the hot springs with you in <em>Hades 2</em>. All of the characters need to be somewhat friendly with you before they will just dive in, however. This means you will need to bring them gifts to improve their affection for you. The most prominent gift for many of these characters is simple Nectar, and for most of them the characters, you can just keep bringing them Nectar to unlock the required level of affection to get them in the tub. You can purchase Nectar from the Wretched Broker, or as a reward for clearing areas on your dungeon runs.</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Character</th><th>Gifts</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dora</td><td>1 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Eris</td><td>3 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Hecate</td><td>2 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Moros</td><td>2 Nectar</td></tr><tr><td>Nemesis</td><td>3 Nectar (you need to go fishing with her first)</td></tr><tr><td>Odysseus</td><td>1 Nectar</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">There is one more thing that you will need to convince people to get into the springs with you, Bath Salts. To get the Bath Salts, you need to unlock the springs (more on that later), which will get you a single dose of the useful resource. To get more, you can purchase them from the Wretched Broker, who will sell you the Bath Saltes for 50 Bones. You can also find them while out and about on your runs, but you will need the Silver Spade to be able to dig them up. </p>
 <p data-characters="82" data-current-count="82" data-injectable="false">This might seem a little complicated, but you will need to do the following steps:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false"> <li>Purchase the Night’s Craftwork incantation at the Cauldron early in the game. This will cost a single Moly, a plant you can find early in the game.</li> <li>Go to the main area and use 1 Ashes to buy the Cresent Pick.</li> <li>Equip the Cresent Pick and do runs to find the Silver nodes. You need 10 Silver in total.</li> <li>Use your 10 silver to craft the Silver Spade tool, then use that to find the Bath Salts.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="true">As you may have guessed, the expectation is that you will get to this later in the game, so don’t worry about it all too soon. There is also a very useful way to check how far along you are with your relationship with someone. Play through and fight Hecate three times, and this will give you access to the Book of Shadows. You can then upgrade the book of Shadows using the Empath’s Intuition spell that you can learn at the Cauldron near Hecate. Once that is done, the character pages in the book will display the next level of affection for each character, and what they need. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to unlock the hot springs</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="false">If you have yet to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-hot-springs-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock the hot springs</a>, it is not that hard to do. First, you will need to do a few runs of the game. After passing enough nights, a recipe will appear at the Cauldron near Hecate called <strong>Rite of Vapor-Cleansing</strong>. To properly make this spell you will need 2 Moly, 2 Lotus, and 2 Nightshade, which can be collected doing various runs through Erebus and Oceanus. The exception to this is Nightshade, which <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-plant-guide-every-seed-and-where-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must be grown at the Crossroads</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/google-ai-search-god-no-why<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google’s AI search has arrived, uninvited, to my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser</a>, and I cannot make it leave. It isn’t just that it serves me crap whenever I enter a question into my search bar, but that I have to <em>wait</em> for all the crap I don't want in the first place.</p><p>Let me tell you a story from my day: I was paying invoices, and I wanted to doublecheck that the number of episodes of our podcast, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, squared with what our producers had billed for. I typed “Aftermath hours spotify” into my browser window, which–depending when I’ve last cleared my history–either autofills the URL for the podcast on Spotify or takes me to Google search results, where our Spotify page is the top result. But <em>now</em>, when I get Google, I have to wait through a nearly three-second pause before AI information about the podcast appears at the top of the page, followed by a link to Spotify and other results. While I appreciate that, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-internet-is-full-of-ai-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this instance</a>, the AI-generated information about the podcast is correct, this information is not what I’m looking for, and I have to wait three seconds for it to show up just so I can ignore it.</p><figure></figure><p>These three seconds are wrecking me. I’m not one of those lifehacking types who wants to optimize every bit of their day, but that three second wait is <em>just</em> enough friction that I notice it every time. It’s a small annoyance in the moment, but over the course of a day’s queries–any writer or editor can tell you that the number of weird searches you do adds up–that friction starts to build into a drag. I feel like I’m losing chunks of my one and only life waiting for bullshit I didn’t ask for and don’t want to load onto my screen so I can scroll past it. That's something I already deal with when visiting the ad-laden websites Google search brings up; I don’t need a preview!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have announced that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales have reached another major milestone less than three weeks after the game's release.</p>
<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed two million sales since launching on April 26th, which means it's sold another million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count">hitting its first million on April 29th</a>.</p>
<p>The game's success is no big surprise given that it was one of the most wishlisted titles on Steam leading up to its release, not to mention its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count">impressive player count on launch day</a>, but Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse's achievement is commendable nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-armies.jpg?itok=oYpgF2IV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-armies.jpg?itok=f7yR6bRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has proven a runaway hit for developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse.</figcaption></figure><p>Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender says the company "had some pretty optimistic expectations" for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, as well as some less realistic "wild hopes", but that the two million figure has "exceeded even those".</p>
<p>Slavic Magic, meanwhile, hasn't commented on the sales milestone, instead <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1791065617002328457" rel="noopener" target="_blank">taking to X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>&nbsp;to express admiration for a&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>VR mod. Better hope he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-mods-discussion-banned-on-official-discord">doesn't take that discussion to the game's Discord</a>, eh?</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a city-builder with RTS and grand strategy elements (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet">very much not a&nbsp;<em>StarCraft&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor</a>) developed by tiny studio Slavic Magic.</p>
<p>Despite the title's plural, you play as a single manor lord, growing your medieval settlement by managing resources, overseeing production chains, and even fighting battles when the need arises.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-village-aerial.jpg?itok=h16pqTKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-milestone-village-aerial.jpg?itok=o9n1YikW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is scratching a lot of strategy itches.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is in Early Access right now, which means there are still a fair few bugs and issues to work out, but developer Slavic Magic has been hard at work fixing those problems, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-beta-none-glitch">the infamous "None" glitch</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

  <p id="6lZvmm">Dearest Reader,</p>
<p id="UBiz7h">Another season (of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22993130/bridgerton-season-2-ending-breakdown"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>) is upon us, and once again, it is filled to the brim with romance and scandal. As your ever-watchful Lady Polydown, it is my duty to assess all the comings and goings of the Ton, and let my gentle readers know who is worth keeping an eye on — after all, there are so very many members, but not all of them are as compelling as others! </p>
<p id="oizT5Q">This season, all eyes turn to Miss Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). After two seasons of watching her pine for her best friend Mr. Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), it’s high time this wallflower takes matters into her own hands! </p>
<p id="mOuYG1">But is Mr. Colin worthy of Miss Penelope’s affections? This is a conundrum that has puzzled me season after season. Miss Penelope has been nothing but a loyal, devoted, and supportive friend to him. Whilst away from her company, Mr. Colin has changed a great deal, but is his newfound sturdiness and swagger enough to mend the wounds on Miss Penelope’s heart? </p>

<p id="7vimGq">Mr. Colin’s affections, at least, <em>do </em>change this season, after Miss Penelope enlists his help to attract a suitor. Her brief flirtation with the reclusive naturalist Lord Debling (Sam Phillips) is actually most compelling — though it is clear that even if they would make a lovely match on paper, her heart may still be stuck on an old chapter. But this author wishes there were a <em>bit</em> more proof of Mr. Colin’s feelings, beyond a couple of heated dreams. </p>
<p id="5jJBsD">As for Miss Penelope’s side venture as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22995119/bridgerton-lady-whistledown-spoiler"><em>other</em> gossipmonger</a>… let’s just say it has not been forgotten. It lingers, especially because it utterly destroyed her relationship with one Miss Eloise Bridgerton. And this season, Miss Eloise (Claudia Jessie) is in the company of Miss Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), the past few seasons’ continual villain. Yet, if there’s a glimmer to be found, it’s this facet, a development that yields an actually meaningful friendship, giving Miss Cowper’s character depth and maturity. What a surprise to find myself rooting for this previously unlikeable debutante! Even when she’s plotting against Miss Penelope, I am sympathetic, now that we know more about why Miss Cowper is the way she is. And the friendship she shares with Miss Eloise is particularly evocative, as three seasons in they are both shunned by the current marriageable market. </p>

<p id="7PTpWv">But the love story that has captured the heart of this author isn’t the one at the center of the season. No, it is the one between shy Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) and the stoic Jonathan Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli)<strong>.</strong> Miss Francesca would simply like to be left alone this season, and the only one who understands that is Lord Kilmartin. Compared to the big flashy courtships of her siblings, Miss Francesa’s is incredibly subdued and quiet — and yet, it is a different sort of romance, one we’ve yet to see in previous seasons, and one that has completely stolen my heart. The Queen may not approve, but this author is utterly charmed! </p>
<p id="iv4has">Ah, the Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and his new bride Kate Bridgerton, nee Sharma (Simone Ashley) have returned from their honeymoon — and they are here to kiss and look very beautiful. Do they add much to the fraught pageantry of this current season? Not particularly, but they are so very darling and in love (and also, they do not take up <em>too</em> much time away from the main action). I acknowledge that I am being completely and shamelessly catered to, yet I do not care, as it fills my heart with joy to see this happy couple once again. </p>

<p id="3MuxB7">Meanwhile, Mr. Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson) has once again found himself cavorting around town and getting caught up with yet another woman introduced just this season. The one thing Mr. Benedict had going for him was his love of art and painting, but after finding out that his brother paid for his admission into the Royal Academy of Art, Mr. Benedict made quite the ruckus, and consequently abandoned his artistic pursuits. And yet, without his proclivity for the paintbrush, where does that leave Mr. Benedict? A boring bachelor, that is what. Now, all he does this season is sneak around with his sexually bold lover, without even really interacting with his siblings or doing much else of interest. </p>
<p id="ynSguB">What has most befuddled me most, dear readers, is the constant fixation on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22991651/bridgerton-season-1-recap-season-2">Mr. Will Mordich</a> (Martins Imhangbe) and his family. If that name does not ring a bell, don’t feel guilty; I certainly would not have remembered his name, were he not the owner of what was once a popular club. But thanks to a distant relative’s perplexing will, which leaves a lordship to Mr. Mordich’s eldest child, the Mordich family is thrust into high society. A noble effort, but one that still singles them out from the rest of the Ton’s players. Yes, Mr. Mordich is good friends with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22193552/bridgerton-review-shondaland-netflix">Duke of Hastings</a>, but the Duke has been off with his lovely Daphne for two seasons now. Too often, Mr. Mordich and his family feel too minuscule when isolated against the spectacle of the rest of the season. What is the point? I do not know, but at least it is charming to see the child lord learning about silverware.</p>

<p id="7BbHqx">As for elsewhere on the Ton, well, they all get some sort of minor plotline. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/28/22203598/bridgerton-characters-essay-marriage">Dowager Viscountess Violet Bridgerton</a> (Ruth Gemmell) finds herself smitten with her dear friend Lady Danbury’s brother (which I, personally, am in favor of, considering we learned in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709730/queen-charlotte-bridgerton-review"><em>Queen Charlotte</em></a> that Lady Danbury once had an affair with Lady Violet’s father back in the day). The Featherington sisters, meanwhile, are racing to produce a male heir with their husbands — a most amusing plot to see these clueless young couples be romantic together (what matches made in heaven!). And of course, the queen is determined to oust Lady Whistledown, though that game has been at a bit of a stalemate for a while now. </p>
<p id="x1juSg">I am torn, dear readers. On one hand, I came to this season expecting some delicious romance and I have most surely gotten that! Not just between Miss Penelope and Mr. Colin, but also between Miss Francesca and her surprisingly charming suitor. And other relationships continue to intrigue me, like Miss Eloise and Miss Cowper’s unexpected friendship. Yet, there are so many superfluous people to keep track of this season, to the point where I am wondering why their actions are even worth paying attention to. That is, alas, the <em>Bridgerton</em> dilemma: for every interesting sibling and their romantic partner, there are dozens of dull stories twisting in and out of their lives (some with looser connective threads than others). </p>
<p id="FfCmjZ">But even when the sea is calm, the tides of courtship may yet turn. After all, the season is still young. There is plenty of time for those less enlightening individuals to become a little bit more interesting (and for Mr. Benedict to remember he has a passion for something other than bedding rich widows). We shall see what the second half of the season holds for us. Till then, this lighthouse keeper waits atop her tower, a watchful eye cast across the Ton. </p>
<p id="VxhDFB">Yours Truly,</p>
<p id="eHts7I"><em>Lady Polydown</em></p>
<p id="eT7A4w"><small>The first half of Bridgerton season 3 is out on Netflix now. The second half (also four episodes) arrives on June 16. </small></p>

<p>Each year, thanks to the efforts of Geoff Keighley, we’re treated to an exciting show filled with the hottest upcoming game releases. It’s not uncommon to see a few world premiers, too. If you enjoy keeping an eye on what’s happening in gaming, then you likely want to know when Summer Game Fest starts. Here’s when!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-summer-game-fest-start">When Does Summer Game Fest Start?</h2>



<p>With the season in full swing, it’s time to start thinking about Summer Game Fest. The massive gaming showcase spans a few days and begins on June 7. During the three-day event, we’ll see a wide variety of publishers and developers reveal and show off their upcoming titles, including Ubisoft, Nintendo, Xbox, and plenty of indie studios hoping to make a name for themselves on PC and beyond.</p>



<p>Founded as a replacement to E3, Geoff Keighley’s live event, Summer Game Fest, took some flak in recent years due to the numerous celebrity appearances and cutthroat time requirements placed upon developer talks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Star Wars has invaded every inch of our culture, including Star Wars toys, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-star-wars-lego-sets-in-2022">Star Wars LEGO sets</a>, and even the tabletop. It may come as a surprise, but the slate of board and roleplaying games based on this popular intellectual property includes several absolutely killer options. </p><p>The diversity here is strong. There are smaller, less complex options, as well as sprawling games with mounds of miniatures. Each of these titles offers a compelling experience that captures aspects of this beloved film series. All of these are currently available and can be picked up and played right now.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Star Wars Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/PgY0A" target="_blank">Star Wars: Shatterpoint</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jPgbv" target="_blank">Star Wars: Unlimited</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/x3bJY" target="_blank">Star Wars: Jabba's Palace - A Love Letter Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5pXlV" target="_blank">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5pXlV" target="_blank">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/5LxAY" target="_blank">Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w4kJK" target="_blank">Star Wars: Outer Rim</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/e15v5" target="_blank">Star Wars: X-Wing (2nd Edition)</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/XbX8x" target="_blank">Star Wars: Armada</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/y5Vm0" target="_blank">Star Wars: Imperial Assault</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jnJlv" target="_blank">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/nLm28" target="_blank">Star Wars: Destiny</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2vK6e" target="_blank">Star Wars: Legion</a></li></ul><p>Short on time? Click the links above to check out each game on the list. Read on for details about each one.</p><h2>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</h2><div id="183081"><p><h3>Star Wars Shatterpoint - Core Set</h3></p></div><p>Shatterpoint is the newest Star Wars tabletop design. This comes from Atomic Mass Games, the studio that took over X-Wing and Legion, and which conceived the exceptional Marvel Crisis Protocol miniatures game. They are fully behind this new release and have already released many additional miniatures with shiny new content.  </p><p>Following in the footsteps of Crisis Protocol, Shatterpoint focuses on a small number of units with players fielding squads from the Clone Wars era. Aesthetically, it’s a more vibrant and focused experience in comparison to Legion. The larger-sized 40mm miniatures are impressive and offer a striking presentation. Gameplay is dynamic and swift with several unique flourishes. It is rather detailed, however, and offers plenty of tactical fat to chew on. This comes at the cost of complexity, which can occasionally bog down play. For those looking to engage in this exciting new title, you will find a rather sophisticated game full of modern touches. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review">Star Wars: Shatterpoint review</a> for more detail.</p><h2>Star Wars: Unlimited</h2><div id="196833"><p><h3>Star Wars: Unlimited</h3></p></div><p>Following the success of 2023’s Disney Lorcana, the trading game format has found new life. Disney wants to keep the cash flowing, and that’s arriving courtesy of Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars: Unlimited. This one has just hit the market and is generating a great deal of buzz. With a little focus, you can hear the millions of wallets crying out in terror.</p><p>Gameplay is relatively straightforward and leans into concepts common to the TCG format. You spend resources to put new equipment, characters, and vehicles into play. One novel concept is alternating actions, following a pattern common to miniatures skirmish games. This establishes a unique cadence to play that offers some distinction from its peers. Veering away from Decipher’s old CCG, they’ve opted for new illustrations as opposed to stills from the films. This helps to bolster the game’s personality and enhance its attraction. We were able to get our hands on an early copy of the two starter decks, and you can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-the-death-star-star-wars-unlimited-has-incredible-power-and-a-notable-flaw">read our preview</a> for additional thoughts. </p><h2><strong>Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace - A Love Letter Game</strong></h2><div id="196834"><p><h3>Star Wars Jabba's Palace A Love Letter Game</h3></p></div><p>Love Letter is the popular card game that made serious waves in 2012. It’s seen a large amount of spinoffs since, including Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace. This functions much like the other variants, taking the core framework of Love Letter and adding a twist to freshen up the experience.</p><p>Players choose between two cards to play each turn. Each has a different effect and includes iconic characters from Return of the Jedi. For instance, Boba Fett allows you to take a card from another player, while Salacious Crumb lets you look at their hand. The goal is to outlast your opponents by using a degree of intuition and bluffing. This particular edition adds a new Agenda mechanism which changes scoring each round. It’s a solid changeup that adds some variety and tactical nuance to play. This is a simple game, one that is appropriate for a wide age range. Better yet, it’s incredibly cheap. </p><h2>Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</h2><div id="177415"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p>If you and a friend or family member want to duke it out in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game is an excellent choice. Rather than making you buy booster packs to assemble a deck, this standalone game comes with all the cards you need to pit the Reble Alliance against the Empire. It's a great pick for newcomers to deckbuilding games, but it has enough depth and strategy for diehard fans. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</h2><div id="179755"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</h3></p></div><p>If you've played Pandemic (and not just by living through one!), you know the basics for how this game works. Set during the Clone Wars era of Star Wars, this board game pits the Jedi against Count Dooku and the Sith Lord's forces. It comes with four scenarios to play through, giving it lots of replay value. </p><h2>Star Wars: Armada</h2><div id="165959"><p><h3>Star Wars: Armada</h3></p></div><p>One thought everyone had when they saw how fantastic the X-Wing miniatures looked was to wonder what a Star Destroyer would look like. In that thought, Armada was born. It has the same great pre-painted ships, but the action has moved from tactical dogfights to epic fleet combat.</p><p>Along with the change in scale, the tone and feel of the game has also changed. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">Two players</a> still pick a roster of ships and upgrades. But Armada is a more stately, strategic affair compared to the frantic dice-offs and cartoon action of its predecessor. What it loses in intimacy, it gains in depth.</p><p>Armada has another advantage: although individual ships are expensive, you need fewer of them. And there are fewer to choose from than X-Wing. So although the rules are more complex, the game as a whole is easier to get your head around.</p><h2>Star Wars Villainous: Power of The Dark Side</h2><div id="165965"><p><h3>Star Wars Villainous: Power of the Dark Side</h3></p></div><p>Following on from 2018’s very successful <a href="https://zdcs.link/A5oB0" target="_blank">Disney Villanous</a>, this amped-up version lets you pilot some of the most famous villains from the Star Wars franchise to succeed in their evil plots. You’ll need to shepherd resources and cards wisely as you pursue your character’s unique objective, such as Darth Vader turning Luke to the dark side. But beware: other characters can draw from your fate deck and play pesky heroes and deleterious events onto your board, setting your plans awry unless you can deal with them. With new resources and the potential to move into deep space, this is a more complex and challenging game than the original, but it pays off with crunchier strategy and more engaging theme. </p><h2>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h2><div id="165957"><p><h3>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h3></p></div><p>Star Wars games tend to focus on the epic struggle or the details of one battle. Outer Rim fills the wide gap between with a strategic story of the lives of the scum and villains who ply their trade on the galaxy's edge. Except since they're your scum and villains, it's up to you how villainous you want them to be.</p><p>As you fly missions and smuggle cargo from system to system, your choices will shape your character. The cleverly linked mission cards give each game a cohesive but unique narrative. You'll upgrade your skills and ship along the way. But whether you choose to be a heroic rogue or a sky bounty hunter is up to you. Why not both?</p><p>Of course, this being a board game there are numbers to juggle, dice to roll and resources to manage. It'll take both luck shrewd wits to be the galaxies greatest rascal. Much like real life, really. Also check out our rundown of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">best strategy board games</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition</h2><div id="165958"><p><h3>Star Wars X-Wing Second Edition</h3></p></div><p>The success of this tactical space fighting game has spawned imitations across the hobby. But X-Wing has two things its mimics do not. First, it's Star Wars. Second, the figures are pre-painted to a high standard, so you can have amazing-looking games for zero effort. And if you collected Star Wars toys as a kid, the nostalgia appeal is impossible to ignore.</p><p>The game became a victim of its own popularity, bloated with confusing expansions. But a second edition has cleaned things up and added a bunch of cool rules tweaks. Now, as well as the squad building and hidden movement tactics of the original, you can deploy force powers to aid your cause. Existing players can get upgrade kits with new dials and cards for their collection.</p><p>And the core game remains fantastic fun, a fast-paced snapshot of movie action. There are ship lines not only for Rebels and the Empire, but ones from the prequels and newer films, alongside iconic rogues in Scum and Villainy. Also check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">best war board games</a>.</p><h2>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h2><div id="165960"><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><p>Spaceship combat in Star Wars is spectacular, but it's not where the real heart of the films is. That's in the unfolding story, the Jedi powers, the blaster battles. It's in Han and Leia, Luke and his father. If that's where you are with the movies, Imperial Assault is your game.</p><p>Borrowing heavily from the mechanics of dungeon-crawling game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent</a>, this is a grid combat game. You set up a map of interlocking tiles and play out a battle between Imperial and Rebel forces using plastic models of film characters. Turn by turn you need to position your models and use their abilities to best effect in order to win an edge over the opposition.</p><p>That's only half the story. This is two games using similar mechanics. One is a battle game where you pick your models and fight it out. The other is an ongoing adventure where one player controls the Imperial forces and the others Rebel heroes. Over the course of many sessions you'll see your own Star Wars saga unfold. Whichever way you prefer to play there are a vast number of expansions to extend your game.</p><h2>Star Wars: Rebellion</h2><div id="158890"><p><h3>Star Wars: Rebellion</h3></p></div><p>If controlling Star Destroyers or AT-AT's isn't big enough for you, how about a Death Star? In fact, how about several Death Stars? That's what's waiting for you in this grand board game, which lets you replay the entire rebellion on your dinner table.</p><p>Of course, as befits the movies, the Rebel player can't hope to hold a holo-candle to the might of the Imperial navy. But they don't have to: they have to fight a clandestine war of insurgency and politics, swaying planets to join them while poking thorns in the Imperial side. The Emperor and his minions, meanwhile, merely need to destroy the Rebel base to win. Except they have to find out where it's hidden first.</p><p>Rebellion takes a long time to play, but it's engrossing, strategic and surprisingly characterful. Players do get to control a lot of popular film heroes and villains, albeit relegated to a single card.</p><h2>Star Wars: Destiny</h2><div id="165961"><p><h3>Star Wars: Destiny</h3></p></div><p>In a move as bold as Obi-Wan confronting Grievous, Destiny resurrects the collectible card game. You begin with a fixed starter set, either Rey or Kylo Ren, and expand it with blind boosters. From this collection you build decks that span across space and time, featuring the likes of Count Dooku pairing up with General Hux.</p><p>The unique hook is that Destiny isn't only about playing cards - you’ll be tossing dice around, too. Each character in your deck brings custom dice to the fight, and rolling them partly dictates what you can do with your turn. While this might sound a strategic no-no, it keeps the game varied, fast and exciting, much like the battles it seeks to re-create.</p><p>Plus, the variety of the dice themselves help build tactical options. Dice that are more reliable are also less flexible, so it's up to you how you build your force.</p><h2>Star Wars: Legion</h2><div id="165963"><p><h3>Star Wars: Legion</h3></p></div><p>Legion is the ground-based equivalent to X-Wing, a miniatures title with troops and tanks instead of spaceships. The miniatures don't come painted or assembled for this. But don't let that put you off. Publisher Fantasy Flight has learned well from other popular miniatures games and put out a doozy.</p><p>At heart, there's the measuring and moving, estimating and dice rolling you'd expect from a game of this type. Two clever tweaks to the formula catapult the game to the next level. First is the activation system in which you have to balance moving what you want against when you want to move it: you won't get both. Second is the card-based scenario creation which puts a tactical twist on making each game unique.</p><p>There are sculpts of all your favorite characters and vehicles from the movies to expand your collection. The fact they make up a varied strategic challenge to build an effective army is just a bonus.</p><h2>Star Wars Board Game FAQs</h2><h2>What is a miniatures game, and how do the various Star Wars ones differ?</h2><p>Miniatures games share a lot of DNA with board games which, confusingly, often have miniatures as playing pieces. The difference is twofold. Firstly, miniatures games have much higher quality figures and for many players, painting and converting them is an additional hobby in its own right. Second, miniatures games are generally played on an open table with scenery of your choice, on which you move pieces by measuring distances with a tool or tape measure, rather than a fixed board with spaces.</p><p>There are currently four different Star Wars miniatures games, a reflection of the franchise's popularity and visual appeal. The easiest one to get into is space dogfighting game X-Wing, which comes with fantastic pre-painted starfighters, like the iconic titular ship and TIE fighter. It has the simplest rules of the four, you don't have to do any modelling at all, the starter set is fun to play with by itself, and you don't even really need any scenery. Next up is Armada, which represents fleet level action with pre-painted scale models of huge capital ships like the Star Destroyer. Although it has a smaller range of models they're also more expensive and you'll need more than just the starter box to properly appreciate what it offers. Some of the expansion content comes with miniscule starfighter wings, and they won't look great next to your painted models unless you take the plunge and paint them up yourself.</p><p>The ground combat games, Star Wars: Shatterpoint and Star Wars: Legion are very different beasts, as both come with unpainted models and the expectation is very much that you'll paint them up yourself.  You'll also need a collection of scenery although both starter boxes come with some for you to play with. Shatterpoint uses bigger models for smaller-scale action, skirmishes between famous characters from the Star Wars franchises. It's the most complex of all four games but rewards you with movie-like narrative action. Legion depicts bigger battles and is slightly more anonymous in the sense that most of your forces will be stormtroopers or rebel soldiers, with the occasional better-known character as a leader. But while its easier to learn, you'll also have a lot more painting to do to get those larger forces tabletop ready!</p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-90s-board-games">best '90s board games</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
