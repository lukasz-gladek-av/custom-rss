                <p>Elden Ring developer From Software has announced that Nightreign will indeed add two-player co-op following the studio's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-doesnt-elden-ring-nightreign-have-two-player-co-op-the-reason-may-surprise-you/1100-6531760/" data-ref-id="1100-6531760">admission about overlooking this in development</a>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, From Software said it will add "Duo Expeditions" sometime down the road. On the more immediate horizon is the introduction of "enhanced fights with existing Nightlords" beginning this month. The developer did not provide any specifics on what it meant by "enhanced."</p><p>Nightreign is also getting unspecified DLC in the future as part of the game's ongoing support.</p><p>As for why Nightreign launched without two-player co-op, game director Junya Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the studio "overlooked" this possibility during development. "So we're very sorry about that," he said.</p><p>Ishizaki explained that Nightreign is balanced for people to play solo or with groups of three. With From Software spending so much time and attention trying to nail the experience for solo and three-player <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">co-op</a>, this meant two-player co-op wasn't considered.</p><p>"In putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect," Ishizaki said. Just this week, Nightreign received a patch that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-include-promised-improvements-for-solo-play/1100-6531974/" data-ref-id="1100-6531974">helped improve the experience for solo players</a>.</p><p>After five days, Nightreign has reached 3.5 million players, From Software announced. Big success was expected, given Elden Ring itself sold more than 30 million copies and had fans clamoring for more.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Nightreign, be sure to consult GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guides-hub/1100-6531889/" data-ref-id="1100-6531889">Nightreign guides hub</a>, in which we discuss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-you-need-to-know-before-you-play/2900-6611/" data-ref-id="2900-6611">top tips to know</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">how multiplayer works</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-skins-in-elden-ring-nightreign-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6614/" data-ref-id="2900-6614">how to unlock all the skins</a>, among other things.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Nightreign review</a> scored the game a 9/10.

                <p>Sony has announced the latest PlayStation State of Play presentation. Airing on June 4 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, the show will run for roughly 40 minutes and feature "news and updates" on a variety of as-of-now-undisclosed PS5 games.</p><p>The presentation will be available to stream on PlayStation's official <a href="http://play.st/twitch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="http://play.st/YouTube" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> channels. It's the latest presentation announced for an increasingly busy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">game-conference period</a> that also includes Summer Game Fest, the Xbox Games Showcase, and the PC Gaming Show, among many others.</p><p>As for what is going to be shown during the presentation, that remains to be seen. Sony has a number of previously announced games in development at its first-party studios, including Marathon from Bungie and Saros from Housemarque. The next big PS5 exclusive is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which launches later this month.</p><p>One other studio that is staying very busy is Naughty Dog. The developer currently has two projects in the works--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> as well as a mystery game. It's possibly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part 3</a>, though writer-director Neil Druckmann won't say if that game is ever getting made.</p>

            <p>Joining the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">upcoming rush of summer's various showcases and reveals</a> is PlayStation, which has announced its next State of Play.</p>
<p>Those interested in finding out more about what Sony has been cooking up behind the scenes will be able to tune in tomorrow, 4th June, at 10pm UK time. That's 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST.</p>
<p>While the team is remaining coy about what will be shown - this isn't a game specific State of Play a la <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">April's Borderlands 4 showcase</a> - there should be plenty to whet appetites for the coming months.</p>

<p>"Watch live for news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe," reads an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">accompanying PlayStation blog post</a>. The show will last for "40+" minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a chance we will hear more about the PS5's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, which is set for release on 2nd October. Developer Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so maybe we will get a taste of that later this week.</p>
<p>The PS5 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> will also likely be part of the upcoming State of Play even if it is more of a brief teaser rather than anything too chonky, given that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Kojima Productions is hosting its own dedicated On the Beach showcase this coming Sunday</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/neowiz-will-publish-the-detective-adventure-game-kill-the-shadow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, South Korean developer and publisher NEOWIZ (Lies of P) announced the signing of a new publishing deal with the Chinese company Shadowlight. Founded in Shanghai by five recent graduates, this team has known each other for years and participated in many university-level game development competitions in China, earning numerous awards. In 2023, HYPERGRYPH, the developer of Arknights, invested in Shadowlight and has been part of their COREBLAZER incubator program ever since.</p>
<p>The publishing deal is for an upcoming detective adventure game titled Kill the Shadow, which is centered on a protagonist who can rewind time. Kill the Shadow features a unique aesthetic that blends high-definition 3D environments with 2D pixel characters. In Kill the Shadow, players must investigate and deduce various bizarre cases in an alternate post-war divided city. During Steam Next Fest last year, Shadowlight <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947640/Kill_The_Shadow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a demo of the game, which received a very positive user rating. Several comments praised the game's story, reasoning system and visual novelty.</p>
<p>Kim Seung-chul, Co-CEO at NEOWIZ, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>What initially drew us to Shadowlight was a collaborative development philosophy to deliver premium narrative games for PC and console audiences. We look forward to working closely with the team to release Kill the Shadow globally, and we hope audiences find the same charm we experienced as we reveal more about the title.</em></p>
<p>Black, CEO of Shadowlight, added:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is a reliable global publisher, and we were grateful to find a partner who shares our philosophy on game development. As we see the games industry evolve to be inclusive of other cultures, it’s important to have a publisher that is open to collaborating and emphasizing the significance of your content.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, NEOWIZ has recently signed other publishing deals with Western developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolfeye Studios</a>, Zakazane, and Lizard Smoothie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Echtra Games, the studio responsible for 2020's&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>, has been closed down by its parent company Zynga, presumably leaving its as-yet-unannounced cross-platform action RPG abandoned for eternity.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-publisher-shutters-studio-founded-by-torchlight-diablo-creator-before-it-could-announce-its-new-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN report</a>, Echtra's shutdown is part of a "strategic realignment of [Zynga's] resources and priorities", which is pretty typical corporate-speak that generally appears to mean "the studio wasn't making us any money and wasn't likely to in future".</p>

<p>Echtra's only game was&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>, which began life as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-frontiers-release-date-wont-be-in-2019" rel="nofollow">pseudo-MMORPG</a> by the name of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight Frontiers</em>. Eventually, however,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-frontiers-torched-torchlight-3-rises-from-free-to-play-ashes" rel="nofollow">development scope shifted</a>, and the project became&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>instead, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-3-release-date-announced-for-next-month" rel="nofollow">release</a> moving from publisher Perfect World's Arc platform to Steam and consoles (and later the Switch).</p>

<p>Several months after that, in January 2022, Zynga itself would be acquired by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division" rel="nofollow"><em>GTA&nbsp;</em>IP holder Take-Two for $12.7 billion</a>, which was the most expensive gaming acquisition until Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" rel="nofollow">purchase of Activision Blizzard</a> just a few days later.</p>

<p>When Echtra was acquired by Zynga, the company said its new acquisition was working on a "new, yet to be announced RPG for cross-platform play in partnership with Zynga's NaturalMotion studio".</p>

<p>That project was never announced in full, and it now looks like it never will be, unless work on the game is transferred to another studio within Zynga. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

And already people are getting prepared for it to be sold out. According to a post on Reddit (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-reportedly-sending-out-of-stock-signs-to-switch-2-retailers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-reportedly-sending-out-of-stock-signs-to-switch-2-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>), gaming stores in the U.S. are being supplied with large “Out of Stock” displays for the Nintendo Switch 2, apparently sent by Nintendo itself to prepare for the forthcoming over-demand for the brand new console. Which is somehow both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A new console selling out on launch isn’t exactly unprecedented—2020 saw the  launches of both the Xbox Series and the PS5, where a combination of supply chain issues, covid mayhem, and shipping disasters meant shelves were bare for many months after their intended launch. But it’s still pretty novel to perhaps see the console manufacturer itself preparing for the eventuality.</p><p> And canny, too! Traditionally, when your local GameStop or Best Buy has run out of stock, you’ll be greeted either with the dead-eyed stare of beleaguered employees, or perhaps at most a hastily printed sign made in Word and stuck into a plastic stand. But something like the sizeable cardboard signs Nintendo appears to be shipping not only look far more professional, but also perform the handy task of also being giant reminders that the Switch 2 is a thing that exists.</p><p>We don’t know for sure right now that these are official Nintendo signs (although this is what the original poster claims), and reached out to those involved to try to find out. But even if it’s just something one particular chain has put together, it’s testament to just how popular the Switch 2 is going to be when it releases June 5.</p><figure id="" data-id="2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-recommend-id="image://2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-recommend-id="image://2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Availability of the Switch 2 feels a bit all over the place just now.

The idea, many thought, was that Activision was intrusively trying to push microtransactions on players in a new way.</p><p>Now, Activision has disabled this and claimed it was only a "test" that was added to the game by accident. Fans aren't buying that explanation, however.</p><p>"A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game," <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision said.</a></p><p>The replies to Activision's post are full of people claiming Activision is gaslighting fans and offering a poor excuse for what happened. Some people replied to say the new UI feature was helpful to them, as it surfaced a specific weapon or bundle that they might have otherwise never seen.</p><p>In any event, the feature is now gone, but its removal isn't likely to do much to quell the concerns of some that Call of Duty is pushing microtransactions on players. The game regularly highlights paid DLC bundles that players can spend money on to acquire new operators, guns, and other items.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the performance update coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2 will see the game running at what appears to be a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>

<p>As documented by the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-footage-shows-60fps-gameplay-for-switch-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Life</a>, the news was posted on the Nintendo Today news app, and while several people have posted footage of the game running at 60fps on social media platforms, it's probably best to watch the footage on the original app if you can thanks to the "wonders" of compression.</p>

<p>In essence, the update shows&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>running as they arguably always should have done, and hopefully, this will convince more folks to love the games like I do. That story really shouldn't be missed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-sneaking.jpg?itok=c3MI7LaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-sneaking.jpg?itok=aRApZD4J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet </em>(pictured here on the original Switch) will look much nicer on the Switch 2, and they'll run better too.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>run smoother on the Switch 2, but they'll also look much sharper, if the Nintendo Today footage is anything to go by. If you haven't already checked the games out, it looks like Switch 2 will be the place to do it.</p>

<p><em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are just two of the games getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free Switch 2 performance patches</a> on the console's launch day (that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">this Thursday</a>). Others include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Arms</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</em>.</p>

<p>These updates are distinct from Nintendo's Switch 2 Edition initiative, which will charge you a fee to upgrade your game to a Switch 2-native version with more substantial visual and performance improvements.</p>

<p>Games getting Switch 2 Edition versions include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">Level-5's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em></a>.</p>

                <p>Roblox game Grow A Garden is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">continuing to see massive numbers</a> of players, reaching a new high that's more than triple the Steam concurrent players record set by PUBG back in its heyday. The Roblox game is a farming-sim-meets-idle-game, but there's something about Grow A Garden that's seen it smashing records both on Roblox and off.</p><p>After a new update was released for the game--which are officially referred to as "experiences" on Roblox--the concurrent-player number shot to a new high of 11,694,315, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-game-grow-a-garden-suddenly-shatters-several-all-time-player-count-records-3196238/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reports</a>. The <a href="https://guinness-world-records.fandom.com/wiki/Roblox_records" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records Fandom wiki</a> has Grow A Garden breaking multiple Roblox platform records, including most visits in 10 minutes, most visits in 1 hour, most visits gained in a day, most visits gained in a week, and overall most concurrent players.</p><p>To put that in context, the record for most concurrent players on Steam belongs to PUBG, which saw an all-time high of 3,257,248 back when it started the trend for battle royale games. That's less than a third of what Grow A Garden is seeing on Roblox. To compare to another evergreen battle royale title, Fortnite's all-time concurrent record is over 14 million--a record Grow A Garden hasn't beaten yet, but it is surprisingly close to it.</p><p>Grow A Garden released in late March, and since then its popularity has eclipsed other popular Roblox games like Dress to Impress, Blox Fruits, and Adopt Me. The game was developed by an unknown teenage developer, but a studio called Splitting Point has now stepped in to manage it.</p><p>The farming genre has produced a number of surprise hits before--Farmville enjoyed similar viral success on Facebook over 15 years ago, while Stardew Valley remains popular almost 10 years after it was first released. Grow A Garden's idle gameplay likely adds to its popularity--players can plant seeds and let them grow while they're offline, making it an easy game to get into even with little time to play.</p>

            <p>Activision has claimed advertisements for microtransactions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> players were seeing on their loadouts were added by mistake, following intense community fallout.</p>
<p>This announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291">the official Call of Duty Twitter account</a>, which posted, "A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game."</p>
<p>Reactions to this post aren't exactly glowing in positivity. Twitter users expressed their disbelief in the statement, unconvinced that a feature like loadout ads were accidentally implemented, rather they were pulled down following negative feedback. <a href="https://x.com/ProRebornYT/status/1929756558348767663">One user wrote</a>, "this some soviet era level gaslighting".</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-shows-you-microtransaction-ads-when-you-swap-weapons">controversial addition at the weekend came alongside the game's fourth season</a>, and essentially meant that every time you swapped weapons you'd see a billboard-style poster shilling a premium skin. This, as you can imagine, went down like a lead balloon among the Call of Duty community, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/comment/muy8exa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with one player on Reddit writing</a>, "actively witnessing call of duty become the krusty krab".</p>
<p>The Season 4 update also brought with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month">the returning Verdansk map to Warzone</a>, widely believed to be the best map the game has ever had, with a variety of new additions to mix things up for older players.</p>
<p>At the same time, Activision continues its years-long struggle against cheaters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">recently allowing players to turn off crossplay in order to help avoid cheaters</a>, a nasty group of ne'er-do-wells Activision admits are most prominently found on PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that one of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s most-requested features will be coming to the game at a later date, and that a new sales milestone has been reached as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780347576750367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, the two studios celebrate&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>reaching 3.5 million sales across both its physical and digital versions, which means it's amassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">another 1.5m sales in the last few days</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, however, in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco confirm that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will be getting duo expeditions at some point in the future. At the moment, it's only possible to play as a solo adventurer or in a group of three, unless one of your squad leaves partway through a run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-3.5m-duos-roundtable-hold.jpg?itok=vm578ufc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-3.5m-duos-roundtable-hold.jpg?itok=VibhdlM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Duos are finally on their way to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as duos, FromSoftware has also confirmed that future&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>updates will add "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month", although the studio doesn't explain exactly what that will entail.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be getting DLC "later this year", and although we're not sure what that will include either, I'd be surprised if it didn't add new minibosses, new map locations, and new Nightlords to take down at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">wildly successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. The game takes the core combat of its bigger sibling and transposes it into a roguelike environment, where the goal is to gear up, level up, and fight bosses before taking down a bigger boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>Updates to improve&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay and infrastructure are already underway. Just yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival" rel="nofollow">released an update for the game</a> that included the ability to revive during solo play, among other improvements.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign-deluxe-edition/9NDVX8HSXGLR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> feels way more restrictive than your typical soulslike, and many of its central mechanics have been designed to urge Nightfarers to explore Limveld quickly to level up and obtain as many upgrades as possible to be able to stand a chance against the Nightlord waiting at the end of any Expedition. One of the most restrictive mechanics of the game is the Night Tide mechanics, which effectively impose a time limit during Day 1 and Day 2. Once the Night Tide starts moving, certain parts of the map will essentially become inaccessible, as staying outside the safe circle will deal constant damage to the Nightfarer.</p>
<p>The fact that the Night Nide constantly damages Nightfarers in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> also acts as a sort of secondary limitation for Day 2. After defeating the boss, the only thing you can do inside the safe circle is to head over to the Spirit Shelter to get ready to face the Nightlord, so most players do so to continue the Expedition. What many don't know, however, is that <strong>there's a way to extend Day 2 almost indefinitely to get more Runes and upgrades and get better chances to defeat the Nightlord in Day 3.</strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603131423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike Day 1, <strong>Day 2 doesn't end automatically shortly after defeating the boss, and only does so when players enter the Spirit Shelter</strong>. As such, with the exception of the bosses roaming the field outside of locations like Castles and Camps,<strong> the state of the map remains the same as before</strong>. Churches will still feature Flask upgrades if they haven't been picked, undefeated mobs will still be out in the field, and all location bosses will still be in their place, waiting for you. <strong>This means that you can still obtain Runes and every other type of upgrade as if you were playing the game normally during daytime</strong>, only that you will have to constantly heal with your Flask, and use Sites of Grace, which continue to function normally even when inside the Night Tide. <strong>If you plan your journey properly, have the maximum amount of Flask uses, and use the Sites of Grace to restore your healing charges, you can continue defeating bosses and improve your character until you can clear the entire map, </strong>if the situation allows. And even if, by chance, you are killed, you can try again as many times as you like, as the penalties for dying at the end of Day 2 will be the same as those when dying during daytime, so you will lose one level and all your runes.</p>
<p>Employing this strategy effectively at the end of Day 2 requires some planning, excellent knowledge of the Elden Ring Nightreign mechanics, and a bit of luck, but not only can it be a great help, it can also make the experience even more thrilling and fun. Give it a try while playing solo, and it won't take long for you to see how viable this actually is. Seeing as this is probably unintended, the ability to continue exploring without a time limit at the end of Day 2 may get patched out, so make sure to take advantage of it while you still can.</p>
