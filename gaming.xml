                <p>Last year, Polished Games' top-down 2D survival roguelite Be My Horde introduced players to Moriana, a necromancer--or necromancess, if you prefer--who can make the dead serve as her army. She's the villain of her own story, so it shouldn't be too surprising that Moriana is heading to Hell in the game's newest update. If anything, that's bad news for demons, because Moriana might be taking over Hell one circle at a time.</p><p>The name of update is "Welcome to Hell," and it adds the Hell level, which may be Moriana's biggest challenge to date. As seen in the newly released trailer below, Moriana's travels through Hell will bring her face-to-face with the Devil himself. That video also offers a more in-depth look at what awaits in Hell. Moriana and her undead minions will have to battle new enemies and survive the severe hazards of the underworld. Fire tornadoes, lava ponds, and explosive volcanoes all stand between Moriana and her destiny.</p>

      </div>
<p>As you may have noticed, Moriana's powers thrive on death, and she can turn every fallen enemy into one of her new warriors. There's no entrance test for this army. If Moriana can kill it, it's her's to command, even if it's just an exploding sheep. However, Moriana is not invincible and she can be defeated in battle. But she always returns with a vengeance.</p><p>"Welcome to Hell" is also adding some tools to Moriana's magical arsenal, including a new skill tree mechanic to enhance the minions and fresh attacks like Frost Nova, Frost Bolt, and Blizzard. Those are all very useful powers in Hell and beyond.</p><p>Be My Horde is still in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499520/Be_My_Horde/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but the game is getting a temporary 20% discount that coincides with the arrival of "Welcome to Hell," which is out today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-26<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Prismatic Evolutions is down, X and Y promos are up</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's amazing how quickly the Pokémon TCG collectors market changes. We're seeing a ridiculous rise in value for three X and Y era promo cards, which is valid because they've always looked amazing. The thing is, Venusaur EX, Blastoise EX, and Charizard EX box promos have never been a highly-priced card. Looking at TCG Player, the market is flooded with lightly played and damaged condition cards, so perhaps the rarer near mint copies of these cards are worth the higher price tag?
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19">last week's Crashers and Climbers</a>, we saw signs of Prismatic Evolutions chase cards crashing hard, and for the most part, I was spot on. We're seeing massive drops on Glaceon ex and Sylveon ex by 28% over the last few days, which is insane. Let's get into it:</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/26/pixel-9-2025-05-26t135024-371-1748263995267.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxejD?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex SIR</a> has dropped by 36% since mid-April, which would also mark around the time Prismatic Evolutions reprints started rolling onto store shelves. This alongside the community refusing to pay astronomical prices on Scarlet and Violet chase cards seems to be driving down prices across the board.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7LGY?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> has always been one of the cheaper eeveelutions in Prismatic Evolutions, but seeing a cool 28% drop from $338.69 to $240.98 feels like a half decent plateau, although I would personally put my money on this becoming a sub-$200 card before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GZv2?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a> is in a more popular-yet similar boat, going down from 28% to just shy of $400 from $562.60. Sylveon isn't one of my favorites, but the artwork on this card is incredibly detailed. Pair that with Sylveons dedcated fan base and you're looking at a stable $400 card in my opinion.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpbP2?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a> is suprisingly cheaper than Sylveon. In my mind, the top two eeveelutions is Espeon and Umbreon. Whilst the latter half of that statement is ridiculously true, it's a good time to start looking at adding this card to your collection. It's only dropped by 5%, but 5% off a card that's pretty much floated around the $350 - $400 mark since launch (after the hype) is pretty good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't think Ceruledge is a cool Pokémon, then we can't be friends. That dark knight energy and purple flames is just epic, and the artwork on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgY1E?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ceruledge ex SIR</a> reflects everything i've just said. A Pokémon that can still look this ruthless with a crown of jewels floating on it's head is worth shelling out $151 for. Expecially once you consider the 27% price drop from $206.71 from the start of May.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/26/pixel-9-2025-05-26t135054-432-1748264014702.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRVKx?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur EX promo</a> was a peak card for me in the X and Y era. My first ever starter was Bulbasaur in Pokémon Blue, and this is the best artwork I've seen for its final evolution. Apparantrly i'm not alone, seeing as this card has seen a massive climb of 263% in the space of a week. A near mint conditioned version of this card has climbed from $49.53 to $180 in a matter of days.<br>
<a href="https://zdcs.link/QObMGB?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise EX promo</a> is doing the same, although it's quite a bit cheaper. It's up 88% in the past week, that's from $68.94 and currently has listings for $130. That's currently the cheapest price for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a rare occorance for Charizard collectors, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w1qN?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard EX Promo</a> is cheaper than a Venusaur equivalent. It's a wonderful time to be alive and a fan of grass-types. Zard is still flying high like the other Kanto starters though, a 183% climb in a week. That's a jump to $129 from $45.58.
</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Another favorite deck inclusion for me in the X and Y days was <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgYKG?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shaymin EX</a>. I bloody love this card. Providing you had double colorless energies to hand, you could use it's Set Up ability in tandem with it's Sky Return attack to draw 6 cards from your deck, do 30 damage and heal it by returning Shaymin EX to your hand. Oh, and it's also raised in value by 44% in a week.</p><p>Another card to rise by 41% is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgY1J?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Togepi &amp; Cleffa &amp; Igglybuff GX</a> from Pokémon TCG's Sun and Moon era. The Team Up cards were such a good gimmick and would love to see it come back. It's also had a crazy climb in the last week, springing from $127.61 to a lofty $180. </p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. This will likely be the case unless you can secure preorders on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sonys-days-of-play-sale-will-reportedly-kick-off-this-week-includes-ps5-and-ps5-pro-discounts-console-bundles-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 26/05/2025:</strong> Shortly after Dealabs reported the European sale prices for PlayStation hardware like the PS5 Pro and PS VR2 for the Days of Play sale, Insider-Gaming reported the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-playstation-days-of-play-2025-discounts-united-states/">US</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-days-of-play-2025-discounts-uk/">UK</a> prices for the consoles.</p>
<p>According to Insider-Gaming, in the US, the PS5 Pro will be $50 off from its regular price, so it'll go from $699.99 to&nbsp;<strong>$649.99</strong> for the Days of Play sale. The PS VR2 is also getting a $50 price cut in the US for the sale, on both the standard version of the headset and the bundle version that comes with Horizon Call of the Mountain. Both will be&nbsp;<strong>$349.99</strong> during the sale.</p>
<p>In the UK, the PS5 Pro is being cut by&nbsp;<strong>£45</strong>, and will go from its regular £699.99 price to&nbsp;<strong>£654.99.&nbsp;</strong>The base PS5 console, both the standard edition with a disc drive and the digital edition without a disc drive, are getting a&nbsp;<strong>£90</strong> price cut.</p>
<p>So the standard PS5 will go from £479.99 to&nbsp;<strong>£389.99</strong>, and the digital edition PS5 will go from £429.99 to&nbsp;<strong>£339.99.&nbsp;</strong>The PS VR2 is also getting the same&nbsp;<strong>£45</strong> price cut as the PS5 Pro, bringing it from £399.99 to&nbsp;<strong>£354.99</strong> for the standard edition of the headset and the previously mentioned Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle.</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2025-voici-un-apercu-sur-les-dates-et-promotions-du-prochain-evenement-playstation-60170">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Sony is due to launch its Days of Play sale this coming Wednesday, May 28, 2025, which will include the first discount for the PS5 Pro, discounts for base PS5 consoles, bundles that package Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with a PS5, and more.</p>
<p>Regarding Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 console bundles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ps5-bundles-are-reportedly-coming-soon/">Billbil-kun reported earlier this month</a> that those bundles would be on their way, and this latest report adds that they'll be revealed <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-des-packs-ps5-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-60177">alongside</a> the rest of the Days of Play sales this week.</p>
<p>If the price of the PS5 Pro has kept you from buying it, then this sale might not exactly change your mind. According to Dealabs, the price of the PS5 Pro is only being slashed by <strong>€50</strong>, while the base PS5 is getting a <strong>€100</strong> price cut for both the standard edition of the console that comes with a disc drive and the digital edition that doesn't come with a drive.</p>
<p>PlayStation VR2 is also getting a small price cut, and just like the PS5 Pro, PlayStation is only taking €50 off the price of its current-generation VR headset.</p>
<p>Here are all the hardware discounts that will be part of the Days of Play sale, per Billbil-kun and Dealabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard Edition (with disc drive): <strong>€449.99&nbsp;</strong>instead of €549.99</li>
<li>PS5 Digital Edition (without disc drive):&nbsp;<strong>€399.99&nbsp;</strong>instead of €499.99</li>
<li>PS5 Pro:&nbsp;<strong>€749.99</strong> instead of €799.99</li>
<li>PS VR2:&nbsp;<strong>€399.99</strong> instead of €449.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, players looking to grab extra controllers will be able to do so as a "<em>selection</em>" of DualSense controllers will be on sale for&nbsp;<strong>€54.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Beyond the hardware sales, the Days of Play sale usually includes a litany of software sales, both for PS5 games and Sony's PlayStation Plus subscription service. There's no exact word on what those will look like at the time of writing, but we'll know soon enough, as Dealabs claims the sale will be fully revealed tomorrow, Tuesday, May 27, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Half-Life 3 Will Be The Last Entry in the Series – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-will-be-the-last-entry-in-the-series-%E2%80%93-rumor.1198875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The yet-to-be-announced Half-Life 3 could finally bring the series' story to a conclusion, which wouldn't be a bad thing, everything considered.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/half-life-3-rumor-last-game-trilogy-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, the third main entry in the series will also be the final one, according to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/half-life-129859708?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DanielRPK</a>, as Valve wants to leave the series behind. Given the conclusion of the second entry in the series and the decades it will eventually take its successor to release, this is definitely not a bad thing.</p>
<p>While DanielRPK's track record is not spotless regarding video game leaks, there's a good chance that what they have revealed about Half-Life 3 is true, considering what other known Valve leakers have said in the past few weeks. Just a few days ago, GabeFollower revealed that the game's story hook may not be <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/">widely appreciated</a>, and the series ending right after being properly brought back would definitely be something that fans would not enjoy, although, as already mentioned, getting an ending, no matter how controversial, would undoubtedly be better than having the series end with the cliffhanger seen in Half-Life 2: Episode Two.</p>
<p>Though Half-Life 3 has yet to be officially announced, the day the highly anticipated game will be revealed may not be too far off. According to rumors, the game is being widely playtested right now for a possible Summer reveal and Winter release, and is fully playable from beginning to end.</p>

			<p>With the reveal of the Mortal Kombat 1 Definitive Edition earlier this month, MK1 fans feared the worst. That Warner Bros. and NetherRealm had officially moved on from the game, and MK1 would have no more new DLC characters or story chapters added.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, WB confirmed those fears, announcing in <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">a post on X</a> that while Mortal Kombat 1 will receive bug support and balance adjustments in the future, "<em>there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1</em>," the post began, "<em>and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition - Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NT7MUHRcKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MK1 launched with <a href="https://www.mortalkombat.com/en-ca/roster">22 playable fighters</a> in the base game, and through DLC Kombat Packs and its Khaos Reigns expansion, added another 13 fighters to the full roster. Last September, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">getting ready to launch</a> its Khaos Reigns expansion, and series co-creator <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1838566106119749948">Ed Boon was reassuring fans</a> that NetherRealm was prepared to support Mortal Kombat 1 "<em>for a long time to come</em>."</p>
<p>Eight months later, NetherRealm is moving on to its next project, which many are speculating will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer/">Injustice 3</a>. NetherRealm has been going back and forth from Mortal Kombat to Injustice for more than a decade now, with the jump from Mortal Kombat 11 to Mortal Kombat 1 being the only time where Injustice was seemingly skipped.</p>
<p>It's not impossible that NetherRealm has another MK game lined up, but it feels unlikely. Hopefully, it won't be too long before we officially know what NetherRealm has lined up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo is entering a new era. While most everyone associates the company with video games, for the last few years the brand behind Mario has been steadily expanding itself into something much larger.</p><p>“I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company, but we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company,” Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, Shinya Takahashi, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">told me in 2023</a>. Design legend Shigeru Miyamoto echoed the same idea <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">at the opening of Nintendo’s first museum last year</a>. “What I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company,” he said.</p><p>To that end, Nintendo has entered into new areas like theme parks and Hollywood films. At the same time, it’s now attempting to maintain its foothold in games with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642420/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-preview">the launch of the Switch 2</a>, a follow-up to its most successful home console to date. Each of these moves is a bold bet designed to broaden Nintendo’s scope — but each one does that in the safest possible way.</p><p>As Nintendo gets more ambitious, it’s also getting less risky.</p><p>The Switch 2 is the most obvious example. It’s right there in the name. Instead of switching things up with a left field idea like the Wii’s motion controls, Nintendo is sticking with what works. The Switch 2 retains the same form factor as its predecessor, but with a bigger screen, more powerful internals, and redesigned controllers. Given that the Switch has sold more than 150 million units over the last eight years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">it makes sense for Nintendo to be a little boring here</a>, and simply refine a concept that it knows works. It even plays most of the same games.</p><p>The first two major first-party exclusives for the console — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> — feed into this idea, with new features built largely around the Switch 2’s enhanced power. In <em>Mario Kart</em> it’s a large open world that connects its race tracks, while <em>Donkey Kong</em> lets you smash the world around you to open new areas and pathways.</p><p>That safeness points to a larger way of thinking within Nintendo beyond its next console. Each of Nintendo’s recent big bets had a similar amount of risk-aversion to it. When the company finally decided to exorcise the ghosts of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">the live-action <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie from the ’90s</a>, it partnered with Illumination, the animation studio behind existing hits like <em>Minions</em> and <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em>, which had previously been trusted with Dr. Seuss adaptations <em>The Grinch</em> and <em>The Lorax</em>.</p><p>The result of this partnership, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, was a playful homage that stuck closely to the source material. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">earned more than $1 billion</a> and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666569/super-mario-world-movie-sequel-nintendo-universal">getting a sequel next year</a>. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">upcoming live-action <em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie</a> is a touch riskier, but there Nintendo recruited Wes Ball, a relatively unheralded director who nonetheless has a track record of successfully stewarding action franchises like <em>Planet of the Apes</em> and <em>Maze Runner</em>. In both instances, Miyamoto — the guy who created both <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> — is involved, serving as a producer.</p><p>That involvement is a key part of this expansion. Nintendo is attempting to mitigate risk by remaining deeply involved in all of these new ventures. That’s one way to avoid a movie where Bowser — sorry, King Koopa — is Dennis Hopper playing some kind of evolved dinosaur, and Bob-ombs walk around wearing Reebok sneakers. Miyamoto has made a point to be a part of these new initiatives, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview">dating back to when Nintendo released its first proper mobile game with <em>Super Mario Run</em></a>.</p><p>This includes Nintendo’s theme parks. It started with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka</a>, and the company has since expanded with a locations in Los Angeles and Orlando, with another planned in Singapore. Much like its partnership with Illumination (which is under the Universal Pictures umbrella) Nintendo once again joined forces with a known quantity, one with a track record of re-creating fictional worlds ranging from <em>Harry Potter</em> to <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p><p>“We had this shared idea of trying to create something new and impressive, and the idea of wanting to create something that’s truly interactive,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">Miyamoto told me in 2023 about the collaboration between Nintendo and Universal</a>. “In that sense, our involvement wasn’t just a matter of reviewing assets or reviewing designs. But really trying to get down to the nitty-gritty of how people are going to experience this, and what their experiences are going to be. And we had a lot of meetings to discuss and nail down what we wanted to accomplish here.”</p><p>A similar ethos runs through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">the official Nintendo museum in Kyoto</a>. It exists at a much smaller scale than most of Nintendo’s other ventures; there’s only one location, with no announced plans to expand, and it’s unlikely to bring in significant revenue compared to a feature film or home console. But it’s also designed to be a pure expression of the vision of itself that Nintendo wants to present to the world.</p><p>And that vision is squeaky clean. While there are plenty of interesting details about Nintendo’s history, including the time long before video games even existed, there’s nothing new to learn about any of the company’s failings or controversies at the museum. It doesn’t even explore any of the people who have worked at the company over the last century. Without any of that messy dirt, the museum is yet another safe bet.</p><p>So far, this approach has been working. The Switch’s success has allowed Nintendo to operate from a position of strength, and it has parlayed that into successful ventures in other areas. Early interest in the Switch 2 seems to suggest this won’t change any time soon.</p><div><p>It’s understandable that the company doesn’t want another flop like the Wii U or Virtual Boy, but at the same time some of its most notable successes came from zigging when others zagged. The one piece of Nintendo hardware that has sold more units than the original Switch is the Nintendo DS, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a strange little handheld with two screens that supplanted the iconic Game Boy line</a>. Whereas the Switch was once a trailblazer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">it’s now facing increased competition as the leader of a fast-growing category of devices</a>. </p></div><p>There’s a careful balancing act here. If you play it safe all the time, you run the risk of becoming boring. That’s fine in small doses, but for a company that succeeds largely on its creative instincts, being seen as dull is about the worst possible future for Nintendo. Maybe the company is relying on its games to exude its wilder, more inventive instincts, or smaller projects like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">a charming alarm clock</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">DIY cardboard accessories</a>.</p><p>The bigger Nintendo becomes, the more it has to lose — and right now it seems intent on not messing with that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-chasing-galar-birds-will-soon-get-to-pay-for-a-guaranteed-encounter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Three of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-rare-pokemon-list-chart">Pokémon Go's most highly sought-after creatures</a> will become available via a paid-for encounter in a forthcoming event. 
</p>
<p>
For $8 (about £6), players will get to choose one of the trio to encounter via a Timed Research ticket. Normally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/galarian-articuno-galarian-zapdos-galarian-moltres-pokemon-go-9004">these creatures are an ultra-rare spawn from Pokémon Go's Daily Adventure Incense</a>, which can only be activated for a limited time each day.
</p>
<p>
Galarian Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres have now been available in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> since July 2022, but many players are still to complete their set. The three birds are deliberately rare and extremely hard to catch - with most encounters ending in them fleeing. Because of this, they are frequently candidates for players to use their coveted Master Balls on. Alternatively, you'll be able to pay up and a catch is guaranteed (just be sure you have the Pokéballs to burn).
</p>
<p>
Even if you do have the full set, there's now the even rarer Shiny versions of each to collect. Players assume that the chance of seeing those is just 1/20 - the game's standard Legendary Shiny rate - on top of the odds of actually finding one in the first place.
</p>
<p>
If you're keen, you'll be able to purchase the Fleeting Legends Ticket next week, from 23rd to 29th June, timed with the upcoming Ancients Discovered event. 
</p>
<p>
Ancients Discovered will see the return of the Regi Legendary family to raids, including Special Backgrounds for the first time. The event will notably see a temporary boost - and then removal - of the game's newly-raised Remote Raid Cap, from a limit of 30 from 23rd to 26th June, and then to no limit over the weekend of the 27th to 29th June.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-weeks-after-sale-pokemon-go-will-soon-let-you-play-more-from-home-but-developers-say-monopoly-go-owner-isnt-behind-sweeping-changes">I spoke with Pokémon Go senior producer John Funtanilla on the game's changes to let you play more remotely</a> - which he revealed came from the game's development team, rather than Monopoly Go maker Scopely.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-director-says-persona-5-has-the-best-combat-visuals-and-ui/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Game Director Guillaume Broche was featured in a series of interviews to discuss the game's development. For example, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he started working on the project due to his boredom while working at Ubisoft. Then, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-nintendo-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up</a> to a potential Nintendo Switch 2 port for the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2505223a#i-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Japanese website Denfaminicogamer</a>, Broche discussed the influences of previous classics in the JRPG genre. Out of all of them, he singled out P-Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-stealing-hearts-defying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona 5</a> as the best game when it comes to combat visuals and user interface.</p>
<p><em>I grew up playing games, especially JRPGs, since I was a child, so I can't really say which elements of which titles influenced me. After playing a variety of games, I had my own ideas of "this part is interesting" and "this is what I think is the most interesting turn-based RPG." That was my final vision. What I wanted to focus on was sublimating my own view of JRPGs that I had developed since childhood and adding my own originality to it. In terms of specific titles that have influenced me, the list is endless, but they include Final Fantasy series VI to X, Shadow Hearts, Suikoden, the Atelier series, Lost Odyssey, and the Persona series.</em></p>
<p><em>In particular, I think that "Persona 5" is the best game in the world in terms of battle depiction and UI creation. I was greatly influenced by the dramatic camera changes every time the player operates, and the production unfolds like watching a movie. I further changed the camera work to suit my own work and added my own particular touches to it, which is what I did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I still haven't been able to fully incorporate the good parts of Persona 5, so I'm still working on improving the UI.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, while the gameplay is influenced by JRPGs, the way the story is constructed was influenced by the French novels I've read, so I think the story is French.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is likely to be a strong Game of the Year candidate, especially now that Grand Theft Auto VI's massive shadow has moved to 2026. You can read Francesco's enthusiastic 9.5/10 review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 1.0 release, which launched in late 2020, but so has technology, as the Nintendo Switch 2 version puts to real shame the original release running on PlayStation 4 Pro.</p>
<p>A new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1/videos">Cycu1</a> puts recently released footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version running side-by-side with footage of the unpatched 1.0 release running on PlayStation 4 Pro, easily highlighting not only how much the game has been improved since launch on pretty much every front, from stability to visuals, but also how good the Switch 2 version looks, relative to the hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 vs. PS4 Pro (Day 1 Unpatched) – Early Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPd_y_RNB2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides sharing the comparison video above, Cycu1 shared other comparison videos comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 with the PlayStation 5 version running with ray tracing, the Xbox Series S version, the latest version of the game available on PlayStation 4 Pro, and the PC version running on Steam Deck.

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day the system releases, on June 5th. The new version of the game will include both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, which will be included in the retail cartridge, requiring no additional download. This, among a few other things, highlights well how CDPR has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">a lot of effort</a> into a port that is setting out to be among the most impressive to be released in the console's launch window.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nintendo-direct-to-air-the-week-of-the-switch-2-or-shortly-after-%E2%80%93-rumor.1198809/</guid>

			<p>The next Nintendo Direct presentation should air in the next couple of weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tvph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PH Brasil</a>, who previously revealed correct information related to Nintendo's games and presentations in the past, revealed during a recent livestream, as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-direct-speculation-st11-fami-friends-pilgrimage-read-the-guidelines-before-posting.13733/page-26#post-1810158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, that the next Direct will air the same week the Nintendo Switch 2 launches, so the week of June 5th, or shortly after. No information on what could be shown during the presentation has been provided, though it will likely provide release dates for all games confirmed to launch this year, but whose precise release dates have yet to be determined, like the highly anticipated Metroid Prime 4: Echoes, which is launching on both Nintendo Switch systems, the Final Fantasy VII Remake port and others. Given that it is supposedly airing in the "Non-E3" week, some surprises could also be revealed.</p>
<p>The previous Nintendo Direct, which aired last month, focused entirely on the Nintendo Switch 2, providing a proper look at the system following its reveal back in January. Besides detailing some of the new system features, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-supports-live-subtitles-and-text-to-speech/">GameChat,</a> the presentation also revealed the Game Key Cards, which only include a download code for the game, but that can be used on multiple systems without tying the included game to a single Nintendo account, how to access the Nintendo Switch 2 editions of the original Switch games and more.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 is not too far from release and the Summer announcement season is ready to kick off, we will likely learn soon if a Nintendo Direct is airing in the next few weeks. We will let you know more as soon as more information comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/final-fantasys-crossover-conundrum-why-nobody-can-preorder-magic-cards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Card games are nothing new in the world of Final Fantasy. Cloud had Queen’s Bloom and Zidane had Tetra Master. Now, despite the existence of a Final Fantasy TCG, you can play <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/166/triple-triad">Triple Triad</a> in your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fca/22/danitha-capashen-paragon">Squall</a> deck in Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, MTG is Hasbro’s biggest moneyspinner. Historically, we see a new set of cards released every few months, exploring a different plane of existence. You are a Planeswalker, pulling creatures and spells from across the planes to do battle with your opponent. With the 2021 launch of the Universes Beyond crossover series, this has meant that pretty much any IP is fair game.</p>
<p>Want to launch your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/139/gilgamesh-master-at-arms">Gilgamesh</a> into battle wielding <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/239/glamdring">Glamdring</a> and Ezio’s <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/73/hidden-blade">Hidden Blade</a>? Go for it, but why stop there, when you can also give it a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/138/nuka-nuke-launcher">Nuka-Nuke Launcher</a> and an Astartes <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/40k/159/inquisitorial-rosette">Inquisitorial Rosette</a>?</p>
<p>Oh no, my immersion!</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY | Official Trailer | Magic: The Gathering" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSDvLerVcNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These Universes Beyond crossovers are a very sore point for a subset of the community, scared and angry that their wizardy card game is being infiltrated by a someone who lives in a pineapple under the sea. To this, I would say Magic has always been a silly game, the idea of visiting other planes is baked into the very fabric of not only the lore, but the actual back of a Magic card. And to Gilgamesh specifically, this goofball is known specifically for jumping between worlds, looking for epic weapons.</p>

<p>So, to all the Final Fantasy players psyched to get their hands on some new cards depicting their favourite moments from their favourite games, I say welcome. Pull up a chair and we’ll play some games with some very silly cardboard. Not only are these cards powerfully designed, they’re thematically on point.</p>
<div id="attachment_459909"><p id="caption-attachment-459909">Image credit: Wizards of the Coast, Square Enix – Illustrations by Gal Or, Fang Xinyu, Yumi Yaoshida</p></div>
<p>The only problem is that Final Fantasy MTG cards are virtually impossible to get hold of. A cursory glance online shows that preorders are either sold out or ludicrously expensive. Talking to shop owners, they tell me that the amount of product they have requested from their suppliers is nowhere near the amount they’ve been promised. One owner I spoke to said that he was offered just over a dozen prerelease packs for an upcoming tournament, with a comment about how he should look forward to bringing in new members of the community with it. The sarcasm almost bleeds off the page.</p>
<p>However, the fact remains: Wizards of the Coast has not printed enough product for the demand we’re seeing. The set releases in June and it was already declared MTG’s best-selling set of all time in an investors’ call on April 24th. Imagine how much it would have sold if vendors could actually promise stock…</p>
<p>Fans are both worried and optimistic. Optimistic because this is a Standard-legal set, meaning that Wizards of the Coast will continue printing it for years to come, which will help increase supply and stave off scalpers in the long run. This is especailly important now, as the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-final-fantasy">MSRP</a> for this set is significantly higher than it is for ‘normal’ MTG sets.&nbsp;WotC’s <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magic-returns-to-listing-msrp-with-foundations">official MSRP for a normal Standard-legal booster</a> is $5.49, with a full 100-card Commander deck costing $44.99. For Final Fantast, this jumps up to $6.99 and $69.99, respectively.</p>
<div id="attachment_459910"><p id="caption-attachment-459910">Image credit: Wizards of the Coast, Square Enix – Illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano, Toni Infante, Kota Nakatsubo, Ezoi</p></div>
<p>So now we have a weird push–pull scenario. We have a cool new crossover set designed to attract new players, but in targeting the potential whales in the FF Fandom, existing players are being priced out and sidelined. This is not the only price rise in recent memory, granted, but coupled with the fact that these cards are already selling out everywhere, it sends a clear message to WotC: that they can keep raising your prices and we will keep digging deeper. This is not the message fans should want to send.</p>
<p>Worse still, you can’t simply ignore the set if you’re a competitive player because for the first time this is a Standard-legal set — <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25">something Wizards of the Coast had previously said would not happen</a>. This means you have to get these cards if you want to play in any sanctioned format, but if you can’t get the cards because they’re either prohibitively expensive, or if they simply don’t exist, what are you supposed to do? Abandon your hobby?</p>
<p>It’s a difficult quandary. I love both Final Fantasy and Magic the Gathering, and seeing them come together like this is truly exciting. The thought of my hobby expanding to include more like-minded people is always great, and like everyone else I really can’t wait to get my hands on the product. The issue is that I simply can’t do that right now — my dreams of suiting up <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1081/darksteel-colossus-darksteel-colossus">Optimus Prime</a>&nbsp;with Cloud’s <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/255/buster-sword">Buster Sword</a> will have to wait for now.</p>

			<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADaBPspkAL8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth and final episode of The Elder Scrolls Online podcast</a>, a special series produced with Kinda Funny Gamecast, ZeniMax Online's Head of Studio Matt Firor and Game Director Rich Lambert revealed that the studio is making changes to the game's underlying technology to potentially introduce cross-play in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Anything is possible. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> We're working on doing some underlying tech changes that would make it possible. We know how important it is. Again, we started working on this game in 2007. We didn't even think about two platforms, much less six or whatever we support now.</em></p>
<p><em>That whole concept, the "this is an Xbox" thing, because that philosophy now comes from the top, makes it easier to get the agreements done, to do what you need to do to do cross-play, which is an extremely long GDC presentation of technology, you know, handshaking other technologies. You don't just flip the switch.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> And it's not just a technology problem, either. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> So, it's something we know about. It's something we really want to do. We're working on the underlying tech for it and we'll see if we can make it happen.</em></p>
<p>I had asked Rich Lambert about The Elder Scrolls Online cross-play in our previous interviews, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gamescom-2024-qa-beyond-the-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recently at Gamescom 2024</a>, when he said:</p>
<p><em>It's never been a no; it's always been a holy hell. We made many decisions in 2007 that are very difficult to change, and then we'd have to get all of the first parties together to make sure that they're good with how we would go about implementing. It's a huge technical challenge to solve. Do I think we will get there in the future? Maybe. I think that's where technology is just going in general. People just want to be together and make it easy and remove all the friction to play with each other. But like I said, we started building this game in 2007, when that wasn't even remotely a thought in anybody's head back then.</em></p>
<p>It looks like the ZeniMax team has decided to give it a solid try, even though they haven't committed to cross-play coming to the game yet.</p>
<p>The popular MMORPG is transitioning from its previous yearly expansion model to a seasonal model beginning this June <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>. The update will also add a major new feature, multiclassing.</p>

			<p>Saber Interactive are masochists. There’s really no other explanation for the cruel, vehicular-based tortures that they continue to put gamers through. Where MudRunner had you driving through engulfing mud, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/snowrunner-review/">SnowRunner</a> made that slop colder, wetter and whiter, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review/">Expeditions</a> stranded you in the wilderness, RoadCraft shifts the focus from getting your truck unstuck from the mud and more towards disaster relief.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YxFJTFi0Os?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Using a garage-full of diggers, cranes and dump trucks, you’re tasked with rebuilding and repairing the local infrastructure of various locations after nature has had its way with them. It’s a great fit for their realistic, slower-paced driving tech, and with a group of friends, this might just be the best entry in the series yet.</p>


<p>RoadCraft takes everything that Saber have created over the past decade years, and tailors it to the new construction-based format. That means that some elements from earlier games, like paying attention to the amount of fuel you have in your truck, have been left behind, while new, more specialised machinery has been added to the roster, each bringing unique control mechanics to wrestle with.</p>
<p>That makes RoadCraft more approachable than its forebears. Following the pitted path that the series has been on, there’s more of a focus on doing things, rather than just managing to make it from one place to another. That’s not to say that it’s not still a struggle. Mud remains your vehicles greatest enemy, sucking each wheel or tread into a mire and then making it very difficult to get back out, but the tried and tested solutions from the earlier games, like dropping your truck into low gear, locking the diff, or engaging all-wheel drive, are more effective here.</p>


<p>There also remains the ultimate hack: your winch. Each pickup truck – ostensibly for scouting, but capable of quite a bit more – can attach its winch to most things in the environment, from trees that can help drag you out of the mud through to concrete pipes that you need to get out of the road. It’s a constant lifesaver and you can often find a solution thanks to its multitude of applications.</p>
<p>Several tasks that were probably supposed to be done by a crane were instead achieved by my trusty little pickup dragging debris and industrial equipment around. Albeit, very, very slowly. If there’s one thing that playing Mudrunner games has taught me, it’s how to do things slowly.</p>
<p>The other lifesaver here is the ability to play RoadCraft with others. Up to four players can form a company and head out into each disaster zone, either trundling about ticking off separate objectives to speed through missions, or supporting each other, toiling away together on a multi-person project such as building a road.</p>
<p>One person begins with the dumper truck, carefully unloading a load of sand along the horrendously muddy track that must be made passable. This is then flattened by a bulldozer, its blade scraping the ground. Next, the asphalt-laying vehicle distributes its load across the street, followed by a roller that flattens it all in a slow and sensible manner. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a thrill ride, but RoadCraft manages to be both intense and ridiculously calming at the same time.</p>

<p>These big jobs don’t have to be onerous. In fact, you can choose to automate the procedure if you want, setting each vehicle off from the top-down map, watching them lay down the road from the safe distance of whatever satellite you’re supposed to be observing from. It’s certainly faster, and more precise, but you’re definitely missing out on some of the fun.</p>
<p>There is a narrative chain underpinning each mission, mostly delivered by your sassy handler, but it fundamentally boils down to ‘bad things have happened’. Your company’s response is to leap into action, ready and willing to repair whatever damage has been caused by the different disasters. Each mission sees you working your way through a series of objectives, leading to things not being in quite as bad a state as when you started. You can stay here, and continue to make everything neat and tidy, or you can choose to move on to the next mission.</p>
<p>It feels weird to say that a disaster zone looks good, but the development team have done a great job of making each environment look suitably battered and broken. Tattered trees and crumbling buildings certainly look realistic, but they also feel like real places, rather than some digital approximation of one.</p>

<p>The different vehicles, of which there are 40, are also detailed and suitably timeworn, and you’ll learn to love their different nuances. You can also customise your company vehicles, which is a nice touch to help differentiate each player’s pickup truck, and make it even more of a hoot when you hop in and steal their vehicle when yours is on the wrong side of the map.</p>
<p>Playing with others is made all the more enjoyable thanks to RoadCraft being the most accessible game in the series yet. You’ll still need rescuing from time to time, but the most onerous elements, like tyre pressures or keeping an eye on your fuel, have been done away with. It’s enough to shift the focus onto the task at hand, and playing with others is a consistent delight, turning each play session into being big kids with their digital dumper trucks. It’s been one of my favourite multiplayer experiences of the year, and I can see us regularly returning to it in the coming months.</p>
<p>The only real bumps in the road here are the camera and convoy AI. The camera is often unwieldy, refusing to quite give you the view you want of the action. It is manoeuvrable and you learn to live with it, but it just needs to be a few more increments further out, particularly when you’re using the crane. You also have to regularly set up supply routes for AI to follow between locations, but there’s no leeway or deviation from the route you draw on the world map, often leading to situations where the trucks have just gone a fraction off the safe route. Worse, they’ll just blare their horns at you if you ever happen to get in their way for even a second.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, the team behind the ambitious Skywind total conversion mod has released a new 20-minute gameplay demo focused on the quest to rescue Joncis Dalomax. It had been two years <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-new-skywind-gameplay-demo-is-the-perfect-way-to-celebrate-morrowinds-21st-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the previous gameplay demo</a>, so fans of the mod are definitely elated to see it again, although the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-first-bts-progress-update-video-in-3-years-team-shows-progress-in-each-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did release a video</a> detailing their work's progress last year.</p>
<p>This time, the video mostly showcases the original Morrowind quest remade in Skywind. However, before closing, the modders provided a new update on the project's status:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D Art: all base game art complete; now working on nice-to-have art and extras.</li>
<li>Writing: all base game writing complete, now working on flavor texts and extras.</li>
<li>Coding: spellcrafting and Ui close to complete; character creation UI close to complete.</li>
<li>3D Art: almost all essential creatures modelled. Last three tilesets being worked on or finalized.</li>
<li>Animation: making good progress om creature animations</li>
<li>Asset Implementation: gradually progressing as 3D tasks are completed</li>
<li>Interior Level Design: 60% done and ready for review</li>
<li>Exterior Level Design: only Red Mountain, Ashlands, and Zafirbel Bay are still in progress.</li>
<li>Navmesh: progressing steadily</li>
<li>Visual Effects: strong progress on weathers, spell VFX 75% complete</li>
<li>Sound Effects: all armor foleys now completed; world ambience and creatures being worked on</li>
<li>Quality Assurance: progressing steadily</li>
<li>Quest Implementation: progressing steadily</li>
<li>Voice Acting: now looking to fill our last few rows, including Dagoth ur, Vivec, and Yagrum</li>
<li>VA Mastering: most productive year yet; working on documentation and workflow</li>
<li>Filecutting (voice review and tagging): progressing steadily</li>
<li>Music: Applications will reopen soon; composers for combat music wanted</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Skywind Gameplay Demo - Rescue Joncis Dalomax" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wWpMR5mo-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Skywind team still hopes to <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find more volunteers</a> with expertise in 3D clothing modeling, voice mixing and mastering, and implementation of 3D assets via the Creation Kit. Some other openings don't need previous experience, such as "filecutting", which is checking and tagging voice actors' recordings, as well as navmeshing, which involves creating walkable paths for NPCs, and translators to help localize the game's text into other languages.</p>
<p>Skywind doesn't have a release date yet. It does seem like it'll be a while before we get to play it, but at least we should get Skyblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still set to launch in 2025</a>) in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/3d-platformer-action-adventure-game-big-hops-announced-for-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Big Hops</em> is a 3D platformer, action adventure with deep movement, fresh frog-tongue gameplay, where you can grow veggies to build paths forward!</p><p>You’ll play as Hop, a young frog who’s been kidnapped from home by a trickster spirit called Diss. He has a mysterious, important mission and needs your help, but you just want to get back to your family… After a bit of searching, a wiry old Raccoon offers to build you a way home if you can find a few Airship Parts. To build your Airship, you’ll need to:</p><ul><li>Infiltrate the Gulley Gang’s Hideout at the edge of a vast Red Desert.</li><li>Become a Bucko and save DrillCO’s Rigs Workers out on the Open Ocean.</li><li>Sneak past <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a> cultists by spelunking under a Shattered Mountain.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Each World offers a self contained story. You’ll meet a huge cast of characters, learn the conflicts of each world, and hopefully find some way to help. Will that help be altruistic or is it all selfish to get those sweet, sweet Airship Parts? Why did Diss really kidnap you? What’s the purpose behind the Dark Drips he keeps asking you to collect? And if you collect them all, will Diss really let you go home?</p><p>You’ll need to play for yourself to answer all these questions, so consider backing to help us finish BIG HOPS strong! Next let’s talk about gameplay.</p><p>Character designs by Steven Sugar (background designer for <em>Steven Universe</em> and <em>Owl House</em>).</p><p><strong>Frog Parkour</strong></p><p>Movement is king in <em>Big Hops</em> and our kit goes deep. You can roll, dive, crouch jump, wall run, free climb, swim, belly slide, walk tightropes, pole swing, grind rails, ride minecarts and more. Everyone knows a great platformer starts with a great player controller and Hops’ stacks up against the best-of-the-best.</p><p>You’ll feel inspiration from <em>Mario</em>, <em>Sonic Adventure,</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Hat in Time</em>, and more. And that’s all just Hop’s basic moveset—-from there we’ve added a ton of froggy flavor and ways to build your own paths forward.</p><p><strong>Tongue Gameplay</strong></p><p>The core-mechanic in <em>Big Hops</em> is Hop’s versatile frog tongue! It’s cute, goofy, and adds a surprising amount of freshness to this action-puzzle-platformer</p><p>Your tongue is how you interact. Use your tongue to pull items to your hands, hookshot up walls, and tongue-swing your way to ridiculous speeds.</p><p>Doors, switches, corks, plungers, flowers, flingers, levers, and lick-picking are all quick work thanks to Hop’s tongue. You’ll keep finding novel, goofy tongue interactions even over 10 hours into your playthrough.</p><p><strong>Veggie Creativity</strong></p><p>Deep movement and tongue-gameplay give BIG HOPS legs and a fresh flavor, but the real magic is using powerful Veggies to build your own paths through levels</p><p>You’ll find new types of Veggies as you explore and each has a unique effect when you throw it down in the world. Let’s look at some examples:</p><ul><li>Mushrooms become bounce pads to help clear hard jumps.</li><li>Acorns can grow vines around walls and ceilings to help you climb farther.</li><li>Balloons make temporary platforms and can stack to get serious height.</li><li>Oil Balls create hookshot points you can bounce off without losing speed.</li><li>Apples let you place your own tongue swinging points anywhere.</li><li>Cacti launch tightropes you can use to cross big gaps.</li></ul><p>Since you can only hold one item at a time, Hop has a handy Backpack! As you play, you’ll discover new Veggies and unlock more Backpack Slots to store them. You can open the Backpack any time, and using it in a stressful moment will slow down time so you can plan your next moves.</p><p><strong>Collectibles</strong></p><p>Collectibles are a genre staple and there are lots in BIG HOPS! We’ve worked hard to give them all gameplay uses, so you never feel like you’re just checking off boxes</p><ul><li>Earn Dark Drips to help with Diss’ mysterious mission and unlock secrets.</li><li>Collect Dark Bits to earn gameplay modifying Trinkets for your backpack.</li><li>Buy Veggies and upgrade your Backpack, Wallet, and more at Drilson’s Depot.</li><li>Buy outfits, hats, and dyes to customize Hop’s look at Odette’s Outfitters.</li><li>Find and Identify real Bugs to fill your collection in Bugsy’s Conservatory.</li><li>Uncover Blueprints to build totally normal and not-at-all busted Gadgets.</li><li>Find <a title="Games > Mixtape [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mixtape">Mixtape</a>s to play on in-game on your Boombox or Hop-man.</li></ul><p>Equipping Trinkets means decorating your Backpack!</p><p><strong>Big Adventure</strong></p><p>Something we’re proud of is how many different areas there are in <em>Big Hops</em>. As you explore the four main Worlds (Forest, Desert, Ocean, and Mountain), expect a lot of surprising offshoots like the Boneyard, Bucko Cove, Hydro Plant, and Gulley Gang HQ. All these different places to explore really make it feel like you’re on a grand adventure!</p><p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p><p>I [Chris Wade] started <em>Big Hops</em> in 2019 (6 years ago!!!) with a single goal of modernizing the 3D platformer genre. The design trend at the time of giving players real freedom and creativity in games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Spelunky</em>, and <em>Rimworld</em> was so inspiring. Selfishly and jealously, I wanted to see emergent gameplay in my favorite genre.</p><p>Since then, <em>Big Hops</em> has become a maximalist game and taken on many more ideas and inspirations. Its mechanics, story, vibes, and humor draw on so many games and TV shows stretching back 40 years. <em>Mario</em> (<em>64</em>, <em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Sunshine</em>, and <em>Galaxy</em>) and <em>Zelda</em> (<em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Wind Waker</em>, and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>) have both been huge influences. We also spend a lot of time talking about <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, <em>Spelunky</em>, <em><a title="Series > Kingdom Hearts [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, <em>Psychonauts</em>, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, <em>Spongebob</em>, and <em>Steven Universe</em>.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
