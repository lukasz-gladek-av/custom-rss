          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Blitz Royale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735">will be sticking around</a> past its previously announced expiration date, but it turns out that extension will bring some big changes, too. Like how, starting next week, the tiny Blitz island will be the new home of Mega City, that skyscraper-filled town that sat at the center of Fortnite's Battle Royale island for most of Chapter 4. Blitz Royale's first big update will happen on July 15. Mega City will reportedly take over the spot <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1942978180891189610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">where Retail Row currently sits</a>.</p><p>So Epic isn't just extending Blitz Royale as is--instead, it's continuing as it has been with a new set of themed loot pools, with a continued focus on collaboration items, like this week's TMNT melee-fest. While the teaser refers to the collabs as a "surprise," <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942947410650575314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers believe</a> three of the weeks will center on Jujutsu Kaisen, Dragon Ball, and Mortal Kombat. Blitz will also clearly incorporate other weapons from standard Battle Royale as well, like the gloves that shoot birds that were introduced earlier this season.</p><p>Blitz Royale, with its focus on fast matchmaking and creating an experience that's palatable for mobile players, was immediately a hit when it launched in the middle of June, briefly serving as Fortnite's most popular mode. Player counts have fallen off somewhat since then, but Blitz still stands solidly in third place behind Battle Royale/Zero Build and Reload. And it's <em>well</em> ahead of the fourth place Fortnite OG. So it's no surprise at all that Epic would want to keep Blitz Royale going.</p><p>Before we dive into this updated version of Blitz, however--the new Superman skin, available on the current battle pass, will finally be earnable starting on Friday. Word is that he's bringing some other folks from the new Superman film to the item shop, like <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942949864268001521" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mister Terrific and the Engineer</a>.</p>

                <p>As the games industry struggles to compete against other entertainment, as well as its own free-to-play sector, for people's time and money, games marketing analyst Chris Zukowski posits that developers' saving grace is Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/06/03/most-people-who-buy-your-game-wont-play-it/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/valve-cracked-the-problem-that-netflix-was-struggling-with-using-diehard-gamers-and-their-backlogs-steam-expert-says-you-get-access-to-a-bunch-of-drunken-sailors-who-spend-money-irresponsibly/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>), Zukowski argues that Valve has cracked the problem that other entertainment services like Netflix have where success is measured by the time consumers are engaging with content. That is because gamers aren't just consumers, but collectors.</p><p dir="ltr">"The power of Steam as a platform is that it enables hoarding," he writes, comparing gaming with other hobbies--whether that is Lego, Warhammer, or knitting--that is made up a diehard audience that are "very interested in a subject and doesn’t worry about how much money they are spending on it."</p><p dir="ltr">Zukowski further digs into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-defends-30-steam-cut-in-antitrust-suit/1100-6494600/">Valve's 30% revenue cut</a> from Steam sales, which has attracted criticism. He however claims that the reason developers are willing to hand over such a high cut to Valve is because they're getting revenue whether or not their audience actually plays their game: "Knowing Steam players are hoarders explains why you give them that 30%: You get access to a bunch of drunken sailors who spend money irresponsibly."</p><p dir="ltr">Developers may take comfort in this analysis when competing against older live-service games like Fortnite and GTA Online that continue to be the biggest games, even if that means their revenue is coming from games that may never be played.</p><p dir="ltr">"Don’t be discouraged by that! This is totally normal for Steam," Zukowski continues. "If Steam shoppers were rational and only bought games they were going to play, we would sell a lot fewer games. Half this industry would be gone."</p><p dir="ltr">He does have a caveat for this theory, in that it applies more to games with a "very clear genre." "If players can look at your game in a glance and figure out the genre, they are more likely to impulse buy because they say, 'Ah, I love open world survival-crafting games! I know this! I am definitely going to play this once I am finished with the other 20 OWSC games in my collection.' If your genre is ambiguous, you won’t be picked up by hoarders."</p><p>If that's got you thinking of hoarding your collection, then the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/#2">Steam Summer Sale</a> is still currently on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ff4336e3766eb/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been on the circuit for over a month now, and after a decade of its predecessor, it's great to be playing something that feels fresh.</p>
<p>That's not to say all of its innovations have gone down well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">a vocal contingent of players</a> taking against Nintendo's updates and approach to Grand Prix mode, with the 'intermission' routes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fans-reckon-nintendo-has-killed-mario-kart-world-with-its-latest-update">drawing particular ire</a> from people who prefer the traditional three-lap race-around-a-circuit.</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-mario-kart-world-speeds-past-1-million-physical-sales">the sales numbers</a>, it's safe to say that Nintendo will be supporting this one for a while. And given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">the furore</a> around its eyewatering $80 price tag, we don't imagine there'll be paid DLC coming for a long while. We <em>do</em> imagine free updates that include not just minor tweaks but perhaps additional features, modes, costumes, and maybe even new characters.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's at the top of Team NL's wishlist...</p>
<h2>Waypoint the way - Ollie Reynolds, staff writer</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dae5c4f66fc5d/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the recent controversy around the apparent lack of traditional three-lap races, I think it's only sensible that Nintendo introduces a bit more customisation when it comes to choosing <em>how</em> we race. So yes, let's see <strong>a 'Classic Grand Prix' mode</strong> that just allows us to jump from one track to the next for those familiar, comforting three-lap bouts.</p>
<p>Don't stop there, though. Why not let us completely <strong>customise our own Knockout race</strong> by choosing any four tracks from the map? It could make for some truly unique races! If that's not enough, I think it would be neat if you could select your own start and end waypoints from any point on the map, incorporating any track that happens to fall in between.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mario Kart World holds massive potential that, at the moment, I feel is being held back somewhat. Nintendo needs to unshackle World from its Chain Chomp.</p>
<h2>Put a pin in it - Alana Hagues, deputy editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9ce7476c08057/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've avidly read everything Mario Kart World on Nintendo Life, you probably know Jim and I have been responsible for putting most of the guides together. So, um, it won't surprise you all that I really, <em>really</em> could've done with a map marker, Nintendo.</p>
<p><strong>A mix of ways to track your collectibles or mark a location on the map</strong> would've been a godsend, but it also would've allowed me to remember places that are perfect for snapping photos or messing around with friends. I admittedly love stumbling across things on the map, but there were times when I was trying to do something else, like chase a Nabbit or attempt a P Switch.</p>
<p>On that subject, if you're going to give us stickers, <strong>let us put more than one sticker on our vehicles</strong>. What's the point in a cute little reward if they're barely noticeable?</p>
<p>Lastly, for something a bit more left-field (and to echo Ollie), how about a design-your-own Knockout Tour? I am thinking <em>waaaay</em> out of the box here, I know, but imagine how cool it would be to actually choose your routes between courses.</p>

<h2>You've got a friend in me - Jim Norman, staff writer</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb74cf558f98a/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have been thoroughly enjoying MKW. My friends have also been enjoying it, from what I understand. So why, oh why, can it sometimes feel like such a headache trying to play <em>with</em> them?</p>
<p><strong>Local multiplayer Free Roam</strong> feels like the lowest-hanging fruit here (it sure would have made finding all those P Switches a lot easier), and while there is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-play-free-roam#can-i-play-free-roam-in-split-screen"><em>some</em> semblance of a workaround</a>, it ain't the full-fat experience I'm after.</p>
<p>Even if Free Roam is off the table, can we at least have it so I can <strong>add friends to pre-existing online lobbies</strong>? If I'm playing with one group and then the lovely Felix-from-Nintendo-Life-here pops up online, there's currently no way for me to add him to my lobby so we can all play together. Oh no. Instead, I've got to clear everyone out and start all over again with a fresh room. God forbid I do all of that only for Zion-from-Nintendo-Life-here to come online after a race or two...</p>
<p>I'll be willing to forget all of the above, however, if my beloved <strong>Koopalings</strong> were to rejoin the roster. I miss Roy.</p>
<h2>New Kids on the (?) Block - Gavin Lane, editor</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b3019592fb10d/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As Jim has brought up the roster, <strong>Kid Pauline</strong> from the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">DK Bananza</a> feels like a no-brainer addition to the roster. Both DK and his muse are light in the costume department, too, and given the multitude of unlockable get-ups in Bananza, slipping <strong>more outfits</strong> (and therefore more food?) into MKW makes eminent sense. Who <em>doesn't</em> want Vegas Jumpsuit Waluigi?</p>
<p>Back on the subject of DKB, after reading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">the preview coverage</a> and considering potential lore implications of a teenage Pauline on the hallowed and very much canonical Mario/DK timeline (you just know Nintendo's got a doc somewhere), it's got me thinking about <strong>teenage versions of other Mushroom Kingdom residents</strong>. We've had the babies, now it's time for the t(w)eens. Yes, you heard it here first: this is the <em>real</em> reason Nintendo gave <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-charles-martinet-made-gamings-greatest-accident-a-real-character">Charles Martinet</a> his P45. He just wasn't quite able to nail Squeaky-Voiced Teen Mario.</p>
<p>Am I 100% serious? Perhaps 50%, but I <em>would</em> enjoy seeing what Nintendo's artists did with a 'Waluigi-but-a-teenager' brief. If they're scraping the Mushroom Kingdom barrel (hey, I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-unlock-all-characters#top-30">Conkdor</a> as much as the next man, but c'mon!) and they're holding back the Links and Inklings and wider Nintendo universe characters for some reason, sure, give me Peach with a pimple. Give me edgy, emo Toad. Show me Wario before he went off the rails.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b2b6c067ad885/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>C'mon, don't you want to see an official, safe-for-work teenage Bowser? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and <strong>200cc</strong>, I suppose. Preferably with an obscure unlock method involving rune symbols drawn in Mouse Mode and getting three-star golds in every online Knockout Tour by reversing over each checkpoint line.</p>

			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software aims to improve upon the series' predecessors in all regards, including the endgame portion. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/07/creative-director-discusses-designing-the-very-ambitious-endgame-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Game Informer</a>, Creative Director Graeme Timmins explained:</p>



<p><em>I care about it a lot personally, as my role on Borderlands 3 was curating what became the endgame for that. I know what's important to our community, and that's built already into the game. Like, we made purposeful decisions with our Action Skill tree, assuming what will come in the future with our endgame. It's not a secret that we always eventually do level-cap increases, right? That's built into the high-level design of saying, 'Okay, if that's going to still be in our future, how can we make our Action Skill tree this time anticipate that and be balanced from the jump.</em></p>



<p><em>In Borderlands 3, we ended at 72 skill points. It's a really high number, right? And so, for the game designer in me, that can create a lot of chaos with how those Action Skills were designed. You lose build diversity as you add more skill points because everyone's homogeneous, because they all have the same skills ultimately unlocked. We've thought about Borderlands 4's endgame from the jump, and we have some great plans for it that we're going to share, but I think we're taking a lot of the lessons from both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and Borderlands to make sure that we execute the best version of the endgame yet for Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>If it succeeds, Borderlands 4 could be a very long lived game, as the endgame is what can really keep players coming to it. We'll see after launch, which isn't far at all, especially after Gearbox brought the launch date forward <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from September 23 to September 12</a>, much to the excitement of fans.</p>

            <p>Of all the "what if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but" projects on offer, there are surely none so atrocious and indecent, so utterly irresponsible of conception and offensive to human dignity as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdigo">Birdigo</a>, which bills itself as "what if Balatro, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wordle-past-answers">Wordle</a>".

<p>Before you NYT sympathisers accuse me of riding far too high on my already stratospheric high horse, let me confess that a significant percentage of Rock Paper Shotgun's daily eyeballing comes from Wordle guides. I'm not saying that I sleep on a bed of Wordle guides, but if I had to stuff a mattress with any RPS content, it would be that. And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>. The idea of these two games forming one game makes me feel like I'm watching a stellar collision, and that's before you consider the birds. Combine Balatro and Wordle, and you get birds. These are the puns that cause our parents, children and employers to stop talking to us.</p>
<p>Birdigo is the brainspawn of John August, scriptwriter for Corpse Bride and Charlie's Angels, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bonfire-peaks">Bonfire Peaks</a> developer Corey Martin. Apparently it all started on a podcast. Nothing honourable ever begins with a podcast. The basic mechanic is assembling letter tiles to make words, which earn you "flaps" with which to fly a flock of fidgety, boggle-eyed wildfowl around the world. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3264170/Birdigo__bird_word_game/">The Steam page</a> acknowledges Scrabble as a third influence, here. If they were <em>true</em> artists, they'd have incorporated that into the title pun, but I guess they couldn't think of a SFW narrative theme for a game called Birdigrabble.</p>
<p>The Balatro element, meanwhile, takes the form of multipliers and modifiers which let you jimmy the basic scoring system. "Longer words score higher, but specific combos can turn short words into powerhouses," the Steam page comments. "Use enchanted feathers, letters and songs to change the rules of the game as you go." All japes and jeering aside, I think this is probably quite fun. It's out 30th July, and you can find a demo on Steam.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-end-is-nigh-for-balatro-and-wordle-have-had-a-terrible-avian-child]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a>, the latest wonderfully weird game from Swiss devs Playables, will turn you into a fly. I mean, the clue was in the name. You live for a matter of seconds every playthrough, and in that time, you've got a bug bucket list of stuff you can do.</p>
<p>You'd better not screw around. Or you'd better get on with screwing around. Either way, this cool cousin/sibling to the equally bizarre <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fine-2018-games">Kids</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-my-exercise">My Exercise</a> is coming out on PC July 31st.</p>

<p>"Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die," reads Time Flies' Steam description. It's not wrong. It's hand-drawn world has "delightfully accurate fly physics", "numerous intriguing ways to die", and "grimly variable life expectancy based on player location".</p>
<p>If you want more info on that last part, artist and director Michael Frei explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/time-flies-lands-on-ps5-on-july-31/">PS Blog</a> that how long a playthrough of the game lasts depends on what average life expectancy according to the World Health Organization is in your region of the world. For example, if you're in the US, the game'll register that figure to be 76.4 years and give you 76.4 seconds to play before your fly dies. So, it looks like those of us in the UK'll be getting <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/826">about 80.1 seconds</a>.</p>

<p>In that time, you can accomplish bucket list goals by doing everything from getting drunk, to learning an instrument, to making someone laugh, to reading a book. Or you can try to find god, something Frei discusses in that blog post. Or you can just roll with it.</p>
<p>"What to do in this world before you die? That is a difficult question to answer," Frei wrote, "Luckily, the game contains a list of things for you to do. All you need to do is figure out how to do them, and then do them all within one lifetime. It might seem impossible at first, but you can die trying, and eventually you’ll get the hang of it. It is a game about life, but you get many chances."</p>
<p>Sounds equally filled with fun and existential dread to me, and I'll definitely be adding it to my list of things to do before I eventually expire, likely just before getting to the DLC in my millionth Fallout New Vegas playthrough.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/time-flies-is-about-a-bug-finding-god-or-learning-guitar-in-something-like-764-seconds-and-its-got-a-release-date]]></content:encoded>

Charge Jumps generate Mini-Turbos just like drifting does too, and <em>Mario Kart World </em>features more wide straight paths than any game in the series has had before.

These findings were then confirmed via a YouTube video by Karting All Day titled “What’s the FASTEST way to go STRAIGHT in Mario Kart World?” Among the experiments shown in the video, a racer using Charge Jumps is shown going face to face against an identical racer who is simply accelerating forward without pressing any other buttons. The Charge Jump player definitively loses.</p><h2 id="h4743"><a id=""></a>The Charge Jump slows you down, no matter which character or vehicle you use</h2><p>The video by Karting All Day is probably enough evidence to show that you shouldn’t spam Charge Jumps in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but just to be <em>extra </em>sure, I repeated the video’s experiments myself. I switched my test subjects to two Baby Marios using the Cute Scoot just to see if a low Top Speed and high Acceleration build would meaningfully change the results.</p><p>[Narrator’s voice]: it didn’t. </p><p>The Charge-Jump-spamming-Baby-Mario would always lose ground as soon as he initiated a Charge Jump, and the Mini-Turbo afterward just couldn’t make up the difference. The results were the same on water, though it did seem the two racers wound up closer together than they did during the land test. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-recommend-id="image://c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-recommend-id="image://c5615d59b8f11e5a1be99c3f8f720deb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pianta rides on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Frankly, even if there is a kart and driver combination that can get a <em>slight </em>speed boost from Charge Jumps under the right circumstances, I still wouldn’t recommend it. You’d be much better off looking for jumps to do tricks off of and grabbing item boxes than compromising your mobility for a virtually insignificant (at <em>best</em>) speed boost. Maybe a speedrunner will find a use for this tech on long straightaways, but for now, it’s not worth spamming.</p><h2 id="h4744"><a id=""></a>So, what’s the Charge Jump even good for then?</h2><p><strong>Despite everything said above, Charge Jumps are still useful!

Even if a Rail Ride isn’t a speed boost, you still might prefer pulling one off to break away from a congested crowd of racers throwing an utter mess of items at each other. </p><p><strong>Charge Jumps can also be used to initiate Wall Rides</strong>, which are similarly situational speed boosts. Even if you aren’t an expert player looking to shave seconds off your World Record times, you do need to Wall Ride to get <em>several </em>Question Block Panels in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">Free Roam mode</a></span>.

            <p>
July is here in a waft of warmth (your meteorological mileage may vary), meaning a fresh batch of games has arrived for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. And it's a pretty exciting month, with CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> making its service debut, alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod's well-received Banishers.
</p>
<p>
That's not everything, obviously, and July brings a total of 10 new games across PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers. Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 15th July (with the exception of Cyberpunk 2077, which arrives a little earlier on 9th July), and you'll find the full list of this month's additions below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden | PS5</li>
<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Planet Zoo: Console Edition (PS5)</li>
<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there you go! Cyberpunk 2077 is obviously the biggie, but there's a bunch of other good stuff too. Planet Zoo's a rock-solid management sim, taking Frontier's usually rather lightweight formula and adding some welcome depth (it's also a treat if you just want to build stuff and stare at the beautifully realised animals), and the sun-kissed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tropico-6">Tropico 6</a> is a fine time for genre fans too. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, which we called a "poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">our four star review</a>. Also worth a look: Abiotic Factor's chaotic co-op survival in the depths of a paranormal research lab, and some similarly frenzied co-op action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>. As for this month's Premium-exclusive retro titles, there's cult-classic driving mayhem in Twisted Metal 2 and 3, which launched for the original PlayStation in 1996 and 1998 respectively.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! As a reminder, the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June (aside from Cyberpunk 2077, which is out today) meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-june">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention shifts elsewhere. And as for July's Essential tier offerings, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-games-for-july">can read about them here</a>.

<figure><a title="Miyamoto - Super Nintendo World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca4def15ef96e/miyamoto-super-nintendo-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>During Nintendo's latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">shareholder Q&amp;A meeting</a>, Shigeru Miyamoto stressed the importance for developers to "work for the consumer, not your boss", ensuring that teams can produce games that will satisfy players.</p>
<p>Afterwards, ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura added his own two cents to the conversation and stated that Miyamoto has always viewed games as "products", not "works of art", and believes that his background studying industrial art helped shaped this viewpoint (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shigeru-miyamotos-background-in-industrial-design-explains-his-pragmatic-product-not-art-approach-to-making-games-nintendo-veteran-says/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Miyamoto studied industrial design at an art university, and he views games as ‘products,’ not ‘works of art.’ I think this perspective is what leads to game development that’s more aligned with the user.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it's not clear from the quote, Imamura doesn't believe Miyamoto's view of games to be a negative one. Instead, it helps to ensure that game development is done in service of the player, ensuring that the final product is one of exceptional high quality.</p>
<p>The discussion over whether game development can be viewed as an art form has been ongoing for many years, and we believe that yes, it absolutely <em>is</em> an art form. But it's one that customers are ultimately paying good money to experience, and we don't necessarily believe it's wrong, therefore, to also view them as products.</p>
<p>Hey, if it helps make sure they're consistently great, then we're all for it.</p>

Some, like the all-new bow, are simply new, but well worth acquiring.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Serving as <em>Lies of P</em>’s very first fully ranged weapon, the Royal Horn Bow takes a bit of getting used to.

                <p>At the end of last month, Funcom introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/surprise-dune-awakenings-huge-endgame-pve-changes-are-now-live-thanks-to-a-hotfix/1100-6532751/">some highly-requested endgame changes</a> that turned half of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening's</a> player vs. player Deep Desert zone into a player vs. environment area. However, earlier this week another patch was released that caused a number of areas in Deep Desert to switch back to PvP, resulting in a number of players losing out on bases, equipment, and vehicles. In response, Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/" rel="nofollow ">shared an apology letter</a>, explaining the steps it plans to take to make it up to players.</p><p dir="ltr">Talking about how this mistake took place, Funcom explained that this was an "oversight in our development process and internal communications" and was "intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle. We’re incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We’ve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Funcom noted that it will be working to "reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this," and that those affected can find reimbursed items in the in-game "Claim Rewards" tab by the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also outlined some of its other goals for future updates, which includes removing "all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics)," as well as adding in more quality of life features, and fixing numerous ongoing gameplay issues. It also noted how it's fixed things like account/permission spoofing, vehicle ownership takeover, durability repair, and building dismantle item duplication.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have been affected by item and vehicle loss due to bugs, as opposed to the recent update, Funcom asked for your patience as it currently has a long backlog of customer support requests. It's aiming to deal with these as quickly as it can, including for closed tickets from players who weren't reimbursed properly when the developer wasn't able to around launch. Funcom also said the game has an entire team dedicated to mitigating vehicle and item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about trying the game out for yourself despite its teething issues, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-awakening-review/1900-6418381/" data-ref-id="1900-6418381">Dune Awakening review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team has released a new patch, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>This patch, known as update 1.2, addresses a number of fixes for areas such as quests, gameplay, and performance. It also adds the ability to customise your difficulty settings even further than before.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," the Oblivion Remastered team explained. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players."</p>

<p>In addition to these changes, Oblivion Remastered players who are part of the Steam Beta will also see that map markers should no longer disappear, while those NPCs that started floating about after being knocked down during the Priory of the Nine quest should have stopped doing that now. They really weren't meant to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, helmets should no longer clip into the player character's head, and Snak gra-Bura should no longer be missing those all important facial animations.</p>
<p>Bethesda and co have also addressed a sizable number of other fixes and changes as well as the above. You can check out the <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042">full patch notes for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered update 1.2 here</a>.</p>

<p>Like I have said, the above update will be in the game's Steam Beta. The Oblivion team has laid out how to be a part of the Beta, which you can see below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your Steam Library and navigate to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</li>
<li>Right click on "The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered" and select "Properties"</li>
<li>In the new properties pop-up window, select "Betas"</li>
<li>In the beta drop down to opt into, select "[beta]"</li>
<li>Wait for app to download new build and launch</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, then you'll have nine new games to dive into beginning July 15, which is when all of this month's games, save for one, will be available. Abiotic Factor is the one title you'll have to wait for, since it is launching into the service on July 22, 2025. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers will only be missing out on the two Classic Catalog games, which are Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4, just in time for the new season of the Twisted Metal TV show, which premieres on July 31, 2025.</p>

<div><p>Cyberpunk 2077, however, is available right now for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, though it's just the standard version of the game and does not include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. That you'll still have to purchase separately, but at least it's available at a 30% discount for PlayStation Plus subscribers until July 23. </p><p>Here's the full list of games being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for July 2025:</p></div>



<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden (PS5)</li>



<li>Planet Zoo (PS5)</li>



<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>



<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>



<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>



<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PlayStation Plus is celebrating its 15-year anniversary this month, which partly explains why bigger titles like Cyberpunk 2077 are part of the catalog additions for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, and why all PS Plus subscribers got <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">Diablo IV earlier this month</a> as part of the three free games for Essential-tier subscribers.</p>



<p>According to PlayStation, there's still more to come as part of the anniversary celebrations. Hopefully we'll get to see what else there is soon. Perhaps a few more games for subscribers, as a cherry on top for the occasion? We'll see.</p>

            <p>The second of two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> updates Bethesda told us all they had up their buggy sleeves arrives in Steam Beta later today, July 9th. This one's update 1.2, and it's headlined by the sorts of performance improvements folks have been begging for, plus some difficulty setting tweaks.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, The Elder Scrolls 4.something's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-has-two-bug-fixing-updates-coming-sudden-glitchy-vampire-baldness">last update</a> did many things, but by fair the most noteworthy was stopping a vampire from succumbing to the urge all men get. That being the urge to become bald so you can save like £10 a year by no longer buying shampoo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for update 1.2, which you can check out in full via the Tweet embedded below, Bethesda's kicked off by outlining how it's switched up the settings that control how hard you get Mehrunes Donkgoned by enemies and how much damage you inflict by donking them back.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," they wrote. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players." I personally preferred yanking the slider on a bar that provides next to no info as to what exact difficulty you're at, but hopefully this helps folks out.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, here are the much-requested tweaks the update makes to Oblivion Remastered's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">not always so hot performance</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>
<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>
<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>
<li>Optimise updating of character attachments.</li>
<li>Optimise rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>
<li>Optimise light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>
<li>Optimise waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>
<li>Optimise the weather system.</li>
<li>Optimise character animation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hopefully all of that means you get more of the fun jank, and less of the jank that is the equivalent of a stranger taking a big poo on your living room carpet. Unless, of course that is your definition of fun. To each their own.</p>
<p>The update's out via Steam Beta first, with a full release on PC and those other platforms to follow at some point down the line.</p>

            <p>Back in June, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of alleged undocumented migrants in Los Angeles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests">provoked a wave of protests</a>. The Trump administration attempted to make hay from the situation, dispatching federal military troops to the city in a show of toughness, against the objections of California's own governor. Despite this cynical cultivation of a pressure-cooker atmosphere, the majority of protesters were peaceful, albeit justifiably loud and angry at having their neighbours seized and imprisoned by random thugs at the behest of a dime store Palpatine.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I was in Los Angeles at the time covering Summer Game Fest, and saw a few of the protest marches up close while walking across the city. Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police">a good, longer report</a> on the unearthliness and angst of attending a game expo right in the middle of such events, including comments from other journalists and developers.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles protests and the Trump administration's wider policies on immigration have provoked additional demonstrations across the USA. They've also inspired an Itch.io charity bundle, <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california">"No ICE in California"</a>, which spans 560 video games, physical games, game asset packs and other items from 268 developers for $10. Hosted by jesthehuman, the bundle has raised $26,712.19 as of the time of writing, with proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.immdef.org/">Immigrant Defenders Law Center</a>, a Los Angeles law firm who specialise in defending immigrant communities, and <a href="https://raicestexas.org/about">RAÍCES</a>, a Texas-based immigrant advocacy and support organisation.</p>
<p>As is RPS tradition, I've picked out a few bundle highlights. <a href="https://linker.itch.io/eleflipside">Elephantasy Flipside</a> (pictured) is a glorious isometric single-screen puzzler, the kind of thing I'd have had kittens over if I'd found it on a MacWorld shareware disc, back in the 90s. <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a> is a crushed and grimy immersive sim in which you are a knife-wielding cockroach. <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">Periphery Synthetic EP</a> is a set of reactive, musical solar systems that can apparently be explored using echolocation and terrain sonification, if you're too cool for screens. And <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/centauri-dark">Centauri Dark</a> is a gut-emptying rainbow of a bullet hell FPS.</p>
<p>Got highlights of your own? Please share. Beware that if you've bought other Itch.io charity bundles, you may own some of these games already.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-charity-game-bundle-raises-funds-to-defend-us-immigrants-against-ice]]></content:encoded>

Early on, that meant getting preyed upon by roving bands of veterans who could easily outgun their weaker opponents (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-ornithopters-reddit-1851784501">or drop entire ships on them</a></span>). </p><p>So Funcom did the sensible thing and made the PVP <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section of the map smaller</a></span> with further plans to iterate on PVP mechanics and make it feel more engaging and fair. The studio also greatly increased the number of T6 resource nodes available in PVE areas.

The Deep Desert also wipes every week, deleting all players structures to keep things fresh and interesting.

Some fans have suggested making resource nodes no-build zones, while others wonder if there is a way to simply have the resources spawn outside of the structure. Others have called for the spawn points to be randomized each wipe, giving non-griefers a fighting chance to get some resources before the dust settles. Then there are those who think resources like  Titanium and Stravidium should just spawn back in Hagga Basin, <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s newb-friendly starting area. </p><p>In the meantime, PVE and PVP players are facing another stalemate in the Deep Desert and even some griefers are getting bored. “We found and downed another guy, landed by him and he tells us that it was his 4th lost Thopter today, he didn’t know how to pocket or something,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lv7tve/today_i_did_some_ethical_griefing_to_find_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a PVP raider on the subreddit. “We gave him a ride back, gave him more melange than his small refinery could dream of making in a day’s worth of grinding and our old mk5 assault. After that, we realised that we aren’t built for Funcom’s creative vision of the endgame.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-t6-resource-node-base-patch-notes-1851785897]]></content:encoded>

The PC-only shooter released in early April but never seemed to find an audience, having only reached a concurrent player peak of 4,479 shortly after launch, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1691340/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.

"We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p><p dir="ltr">However, players have the next 90 days to still play the game, during which Wargaming will unlock all of the game's unique Hunters (including new Hunters that were presumably still in development), as well as introduce the ability to host custom games. A final "farewell" tournament is also being planned, with Wargaming stating it will share more details in the game's official Discord server soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters sees players pilot massive mechs called Hunters. Some mechs are humanoid in appearance, while others are massive mechanical animals reminiscent of the mechs from the anime series Zoids. Each mech can be customized and modified with various weapons, mods, and abilities. The game was an extraction shooter, one where players would drop in, acquire loot from battling NPC enemies, and attempt to escape, all the while avoiding or battling other player-controlled Hunter squads.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very first days of the Alpha you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey," Wargaming's shutdown notice reads. "We couldn't have wished for a better community and we'll miss you all dearly."</p><p dir="ltr">Wargaming may be shutting down Steel Hunters, but it still operates several live-service titles.

Naughty Dog editorial content manager Jonathon Dornbush wrote in the post that the studio "always wondered" what it would be like for players to experience the story in chronological order.

<figure><a title="Popplio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c2867edeea91/popplio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's not every day that you get to meet The Pope, but one Pokémon fan decided to make the most of his recent trip to The Vatican on 5th July.</p>
<p>Reddit user ReptileCake took two Pokémon cards with him when meeting Pope Leo (real name Robert Francis Prevost): one to get blessed, and one to get signed. But why? Why Pokémon cards, specifically? Well, the Pokémon in question is Popplio!</p>
<p>Get it..? Popplio. Pope Leo. Guffaw!</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fan-meets-pope-leo-gets-him-to-sign-a-popplio-pokemon-trading-card-and-it-looks-like-the-pontiff-got-the-joke?utm_source=campaigner&amp;utm_campaign=NL_FIX_July_08_2025&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;Ictg=45858995214">IGN</a>, ReptileCake said that Pope Leo took the whole thing in his stride and clearly understood the reference, happily signing the card in question:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkzywlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was pretty chill. We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p>
<p>"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the card immediately gaining a significant amount of worth, ReptileCake says that he has no intention of selling it on, stating that Pope Leo agreeing to sign the card is "worth more than any monetary value can satisfy", and that it is now "a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity".</p>
<figure><a title="Popplio Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2a715c1ebbfd/popplio-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fa-man-got-his-popplio-pok%25C3%25A9mon-card-autographed-by-pope-leo-v0-h3y8oua088bf1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3024%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D07843c370d3f5870f9ecff1477731b2a235f6796">ReptileCake</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So there you have it! Quite a wholesome little incident, all told. Though we imagine this will kickstart a rather concerning trend in which fans flock to the Vatican to get their own Pokémon cards signed.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game for scalpers, huh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella has published the sales charts for US video game sales in May 2025, showing a similarity to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Newzoo's global report</a> in that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> was one of the month's best-selling games, and in the US specifically, it was the best-selling game. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Nightreign topped the US sales charts for premium games across all platforms, followed by DOOM: The Dark Ages in second place and Forza Horizon 5 in third, driven by Forza Horizon 5's launch on PS5. Bethesda's Oblivion Remastered was pushed into fourth place after being the top-selling game in the US for April 2025,  while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 stayed at fifth place. </p>



<p>The other notable entry in the top 20 best-selling premium games for May 2025 in the US, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars: Battlefront 2</a>, which jumped all the way from 135th on the monthly charts, to the number 12 spot, just behind Assassin's Creed Shadows in 11 and just in front of Split Fiction at number 13.</p>







<p>Elden Ring: Nightreign's surge to the top spot for May 2025 also made it one of the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far, though it wasn't enough for it to crack the top 10, since it only made the list at number 11. DOOM: The Dark Ages was even further behind at number 16. The most significant change in the top-selling games in the US in 2025 so far was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered jumping ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows to take second place, while Shadows now sits in third. Monster Hunter Wilds is still the best-selling game of 2025 so far in the US.</p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the PlayStation 5 was still the best-selling hardware of the month, though spending on video game hardware was down 13% compared to May 2024. It'll be interesting to see how different those numbers are when the report for June 2025 is live, and we see how much of an impact the Nintendo Switch 2 launch had on hardware spending in the US.</p>



<p>Overall, it was a month of growth for the video game industry in the US compared to May 2024, with spending on video games up 1% compared to last year. Which is a good sign for the industry, though we'll see if that growth is able to last into next year, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella recently warned that tariffs and rising costs of essential items</a> are leading a significant portion of US consumers to spend less on video games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The video games industry is facing a "fundamental realignment", having effectively moved on from the "content" past to a "network" present that has deeply changed the forces that kept the whole industry together, according to Square Enix former Director of Business.</p>



<p>In a lengthy thread posted on <a href="https://x.com/JNavok">X</a>, Jacob Navok, who, as Director of Business, worked closely with Square Enix's CEO in the past, offered a very interesting in-depth analysis of the current state of the video games industry, highlighting the now mature shift from a content phase to a network phase and how this could evolve further in the future. For years, the vast majority of bigger publishers like Square Enix focused on producing content, which was the focus of the business. In 2004, however, something started to change, as former Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada began writing about the network in his annual letters to shareholders, highlighting how that was the future, rather than content. Many believed he was referring to MMOs, but as time passed, it became clear he was referring to what is dominating the video games industry: the "social networks" of games, or rather platforms via which players access games.</p>



<p>For a very long time, the industry was defined by scarcity of content. Players would complete a game and move onto the next, and this held true even as the industry started moving towards richer mediums and MMOs. Creating good content and marketing the content appropriately would lead to profitable income. This is why release dates were set in the Fall towards the Holiday season, generally avoiding launching on the same date as other big hitters. A portion of the industry still works this way, but it is crumbling. Speaking about the Final Fantasy series, the former Square Enix employee highlights that the problem isn't increasing costs, but the inability to generate the revenue needed. The audiences expected to play the game did not come, and were not willing to pay to spend their time.</p>



<p>What players, especially the younger generation, are willing to spend their time on nowadays are platform titles like Roblox and Fortnite, and a few other dominant forever games which are acting closer to platforms. Add in a social network like TikTok, which scratches the same itches of casual games, and it's evident how players have less and less time to spend on traditional games, which continue to function as content and no longer enjoy the success of the past. Even in the network era of the video games industry, however, not every forever game that also acts as a platform can succeed, as few games can achieve the same level of success of Fortnite, a situation that mirrors social networks well, as only TikTok, has grown to a prominence that can rival Facebook and Instagram.</p>



<p>This doesn't mean that video games are going away, Jacob Navok continues, but it's a clear indication of how the video games industry has to change in its fight for time against social networks and platform, forever games. This is the problem Microsoft is facing today, and a situation that has changed a lot since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and greenlighting the games that were canceled last week, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a> reboot. Concord is a clear example of an industry that has radically changed in the past few years, as a $400m investement and eight years of work with zero revenue generated would have never happened in the past, alongside some of the June 2025 happenings, which the former Square Enix Director of Business thinks to have been a critical month for the industry. Nearly $1bn has been invested by the video games industry in games like MindsEye, Splitgate 2, Marathon and FBC: Firebreak, and none of the launches and betas have gone as planned. Promises have been made to fix the games, but it's unlikely the market can sustain all of them. One may argue that cutting costs could improve the situation, but that doesn't address the real issue: the lack of players.</p>



<p>With the traditional video games industry facing these challenges, Microsoft's recent actions are better explained. AI is a one-in-a-generation change in the entire digital order, and a dollar spent on AI may net back one hundred times as much, while a dollar invested in Xbox would either get burned or earn too little. With the market being what it is today, the decision to cancel games like the Perfect Dark reboot makes total sense, as it was very unlikely these would have take players away from dominating games.</p>



<p>This is something that Sony is also facing, to an extent. as Roblox, UEFN will continue to stay and represent the future of the video games industry. Jacob Navok makes the example of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which barely sold more than Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 did in just three days. As things stand, a dollar spent on a game like this is better spent on trying to make a Fortnite, which is what Sony will keep trying to. The Japanese company needs a forever platform, or it will still be a company in the content business during the network business era. Nintendo may manage to continue being a content business company, but Sony may not.</p>



<p>AI is also going to play a prominent role in this new era of the video games industry, empowering Roblox-like experiences that will give players the ability to create interactive worlds in five to ten years. In this sense, Take-Two, which has shown no concerns for the cost required to make Grand Theft Auto VI, seeing it as a function to achieve a dominant position in the current landscape, Epic and Roblox will compete with OpenAI, xAI and so on, as big tech companies are already making interactive world models that will compete with games. "<em>Games, AI, and tech are really part of the same network effect. Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. In other words, the platforms with the most creators and players generate the most value,"</em> the former Square Enix Director of Business concluded, highlighting how Wada-san's observation on networks transforming the video games industry was ultimately about the network of players.</p>



<p>Although this isn't the first time we have heard from people who work, or worked in the video games industry how one of the current challenges is to convince players to spend time on new games, the analysis by Square Enix's former Director of Business has painted a more complex picture that highlights well how traditional games will have a harder time finding success in the future. The industry, however, is unpredictable, so it will be very interesting to see if these predictions will end up being correct in the coming years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for May 2025, and FromSoftware and Bandai Namco will have cause to celebrate this month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuov7li22j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game across all formats in May, and it topped the individual PlayStation and Xbox charts as well. As a reminder, I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">awarded the game an 8 out of 10 score</a>, so I'm pretty pleased it managed to sell as well as it did.</p>

<p>Of course, given that sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">topped 3.5 million</a> just a few days after the game was released, it's not surprising that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>performed as well as it did. Still, since the game is an experiment on FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's behalf, it will no doubt come as a pleasant surprise for both studios.</p>

As a reminder, Bethesda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bethesda.net/post/3lpmvjo7noz2c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> shortly after launch that&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>had hit three million players, although since that number includes Game Pass players, it's perhaps not quite as valuable as the studio thinks.</p>

<p>Neither of these games have managed to topple&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>as the best-selling games of 2025 year-to-date. Incidentally,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>is in third place, largely because of its release on PS5 in late April.</p>

<p>As ever, Nintendo's chart is off in its own little world, since many of the aforementioned games weren't released for the Switch. That platform's best-selling game for May was&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, because of course it was, followed by&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

It's got plenty of stats on things like hardware sales and the mobile market as well, so be sure to give it a glance if you're into your numbers.</p>
