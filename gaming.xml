When it does let you play, it’s got a decent assortment of deductive puzzles, weird minigames, and stealth sequences where you have to outwit and evade some truly grotesque monsters.</p><p>It likes to spend long stretches of time without letting you do anything, but <em>Bridge Curse 2 </em>is a decent pick if you like some helplessness in your horror. It’s got a nasty edge to it, with some brutal death scenes, the occasional gratuitous gross-out, and a lot of terrible things happening to people who in no way deserved it. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-recommend-id="image://d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple-haired person runs toward a strange beastie in some pumpkin-laden woods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple-haired person runs toward a strange beastie in some pumpkin-laden woods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->SFB Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-recommend-id="image://d04683daef9b853e9135ead14714ec02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple-haired person runs toward a strange beastie in some pumpkin-laden woods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Statistically, only about 30 percent of the players who start a video game will see it through to its end. As a result, many single-player games are front-loaded, on the assumption that a solid start is a better use of developers’ time than a strong finish.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://crowcountrygame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://crowcountrygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Crow Country</em></a></span><em> </em>defies that in its last half-hour, with a plot twist in its final moments that neatly turns the rest of the game on its head.</p><p>Before that point, it’s a quietly effective throwback to the ‘90s, both in its PlayStation-style graphics and the reflexive post-<em>Scream</em> irony of its script. As Mara Forest, an improbably young federal agent, you’re exploring an abandoned park in search of its reclusive owner when you’re attacked by strange mutants. From there, it’s a struggle to stay alive, save the handful of other people in the park, and still accomplish your stated goal.</p><p>Most of <em>Crow Country </em>is creepy without being scary, with a deliberate appeal towards nostalgia. (The designers went out of their way to create<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1777367629730025883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SFBDim/status/1777367629730025883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> mock literature for it</a></span> like a manual, magazine ad, and <em>GameFan</em>-style preview page.) It wasn’t until I reached the final area that it took that final swerve, which turned <em>Crow Country </em>into something dark, bleak, and quietly frightening. It’s worth the whole run just for that moment. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-recommend-id="image://a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character crouches behind a table, as a spotlight-faced creature creeps about." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character crouches behind a table, as a spotlight-faced creature creeps about." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-recommend-id="image://a953fdc72025910c510f1ca217a1aee0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character crouches behind a table, as a spotlight-faced creature creeps about." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blumhouse.com/games/fear-the-spotlight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blumhouse.com/games/fear-the-spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fear the Spotlight</em></a></span><em> </em>is beginners’ horror, and I mean that as a compliment. It’s the video game equivalent to <em>Goosebumps </em>or <em>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</em>, which delivers its impact without relying on violence, gore or gross-outs.</p><p>You play as Vivian Singh, who breaks into her high school on the week of Halloween so her best friend Amy can conduct a séance. Soon, Vivian has been seemingly pulled back in time to the school as it was in 1991, right before a devastating fire that killed two-dozen students. She has to find her way through the school, past a strange man with a theater light for a face, and rescue Amy before history repeats itself.</p><p>If you’ve got any horror or adventure-game chops, you’ll breeze straight through <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>. It’s a fast-moving six-hour campfire story that really comes alive in its second half. The real value to picking it up is if you’ve got a teenager or precocious kid who’s interested in playing some creepy games for Halloween. It’s a solid dose of memorable PG-13 dread. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-recommend-id="image://5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-recommend-id="image://5b3b3f998463036a1f6e4ab6546bd2a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our character fires a gun at a zombie in what might be a sewer tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A couple of different indie developers made “spiritual sequels” to Konami franchises this year, only to have Konami suddenly break its silence and steal their thunder.

What initially looks like a midnight run through a dead suburb turns bloody when Mica discovers the ruins are infested with bizarre plants and strange monsters.</p><p><em>Hollowbody</em> ends right when it feels like it’s hitting its stride, but it’s good while it lasts. For a game produced by one person with crowdfunding, it understands the value of atmosphere better than most indie survival horror projects. I’d be interested in seeing what Headware Games could do with an actual budget. As of October 29, it’s just released a new update that’s added several locations, tweaked its balance, and thrown in a few more puzzles. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-recommend-id="image://a393a361711150be920733a2d563c083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swansea talks to a character stuck in yellow foam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It almost takes longer to explain<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.headwaregames.com/hollowbody" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span><em> </em>than it does to play. It’s a psychological thriller about space truckers who crash their ship, then go insane while waiting for a rescue that probably isn’t coming. The title of the game comes from their cargo, which turns out to be nothing more valuable than gallons upon gallons of 15 percent ABV mouthwash.</p><p>The word I keep coming back to is “bleak.” <em>Mouthwashing </em>starts off as a narrative-led adventure game, then occasionally turns into stealth/action as its characters degenerate. It’s also more willing to play with its basic presentation than any game has been since maybe <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, as it often abruptly transitions between scenes with effects that look like a hard crash.</p><p>It’s short, at around four hours, but if you take the trip, you’ll be thinking about this one for a while. It’s a vicious little bastard of an experience.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-recommend-id="image://7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple Muppet-like runs down a corridor toward the player." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple Muppet-like runs down a corridor toward the player." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->John and Evan Szymanski / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-recommend-id="image://7c3e724825f7ea44bb60c1090a9dea56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple Muppet-like runs down a corridor toward the player." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is what you’d have gotten if you’d hired David Lynch to direct <em>The Muppet Movie</em>.

When city repairman Gordon O’Brian shows up to find out why, he’s thrown into a cuddly nightmare. When this station closed down, the old performers got locked inside, and they’ve all gone insane. They don’t <em>mean </em>to hurt Gordon, but they will.</p><p>This is a hard one to explain or justify, but <em>My Friendly Neighborhood </em>makes the most of a twisted premise. Like <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, it’s creepy without being gory, as every puppet has a gift of coming out of nowhere. And like <em>Crow Country</em>, it saves its scariest sequence for its endgame. If you missed this one last year, this Halloween’s a solid excuse to revisit it.</p><p>If you want something that’s about as unhinged, but much darker and weirder, the developers, the Szymanskis, spun off an older project into a standalone game earlier this year called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536530/The_Pony_Factory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536530/The_Pony_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pony Factory</em></a></span>.

It’d be weirder if I didn’t.</p><p><em>Signalis </em>just celebrated its second anniversary, but if you’re new to survival horror with the <em>SH2 </em>remake or haven’t paid attention to the genre for a while, it’s worth bringing it up again. It also put out a patch last year with several optional improvements to its inventory system, which addressed one of fans’ most common complaints.</p><p>Self-described as “a dream about dreaming,” <em>Signalis </em>is a story of cosmic space horror. As an android worker in a dystopian society, you survived a shipwreck on the distant ice planet Leng, but your co-pilot is missing. Your search for her takes you into a nearby mining colony, where the humans have fallen prey to an inexplicable disease and the other androids have gone insane.</p><p>It’s also possible that this is all a dream, and not necessarily yours; that you’re lost in some Lovecraftian nightmare realm; and/or that you’re trapped in an endless cycle of violence by an insane god. All of these can be true at once. <em>Signalis </em>is a dream. Old rules no longer apply.</p><p>It’s by turns oppressive, frightening, and surreal, with a visual style that’s uniquely its own. If you haven’t played it, or you bounced off it at launch due to its inventory mechanics, now is a good time to check it out.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran of developer BioWare’s fantasy RPGs or a newcomer looking to see what all the fuss is about, it’s worth noting that <em>The Veilguard </em>represents a pretty drastic shift from the tactical, open-zone RPG gameplay of its predecessor, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. So no matter what your previous experience, there are a few things worth noting before you dive into this long-awaited return to Thedas.

My most honest recommendation is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">play through all of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games and a few pieces of DLC</a></span>, but if you just don’t have the time and patience for all that, at least read or watch a summary of the events of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>and its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC. <em>The Veilguard </em>will give you a brief and kind of vague recounting of a few details when you boot it up, but it’s woefully insufficient in giving you a full sense of what led to the game’s opening moments.</p><h2 id="h314987"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t pick your faction based on fashion</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> shows off several casual outfits and “aspirational” armors tied to your hero’s faction in the character creator. The faction you choose for Rook (the protagonist) gives the character a backstory that ties them to different places and cultures within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. But if you’re anything like me, you’re trying to serve at any given moment in an RPG, and I was conflicted about my faction choice because I wanted one of the sluttier outfits. However, this is your PSA that every casual outfit and aspirational armor you see in the character creator is available later in the game, so make the choice based on the story you want to tell, rather than the clothes you want to wear. You’ll find these outfits and armors in stores tied to their respective faction when you reach them in your playthrough.</p><h2 id="h314988"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t accidentally skip the Inquisitor customization screen</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>lets you create two characters at the beginning of the game. One is Rook, the hero you’ll be playing as, and the other is the Inquisitor, the protagonist from 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. However, while the screen to customize the latter isn’t buried, it’s not as visually apparent as it probably should be. On the last two pages of Rook’s customization, you’ll see an option on the right-hand side to go to a different screen to create the Inquisitor and make three choices from the last game that will carry over. Unfortunately, it’s entirely possible to miss this screen, and the game doesn’t do much to direct your attention to it. You won’t have another chance to make the Inquisitor or these choices, and if you don’t, you’ll get hit with a default that might look and think nothing like your old hero.</p><h2 id="h314989"><a id=""></a><strong>You can only sell valuables at certain stores</strong></h2><p>Speaking of in-game shops, you’ll pick up a lot of valuables throughout your adventure that only exist to be sold to merchants you meet in Thedas. However, you might notice that not every shopkeeper is looking to buy your garbage. Each region has a specific merchant that is tied to the local faction, such as the Shadow Dragons in Minrathous or the Antivan Crows in Treviso. These will have a specific menu option to let you sell valuables, as well as upgrade their shops with other materials you find on your quests. Selling valuables to these shops will also increase the faction’s power, which is another way to improve relationships with groups beyond doing their quest lines.</p><figure id="" data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-recommend-id="image://762f6348a9201b4b80094245e887c8c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Harding looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h314990"><a id=""></a><strong>Keep an eye out for gifts for your teammates</strong></h2><p>Like in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, you can give gifts to your companions for an approval boost. (However, you unfortunately don’t get a new conversation out of it.) You can typically find these in the various shops around Thedas, with the gift often corresponding to the companion whose faction is based in that region.</p><h2 id="h314991"><a id=""></a><strong>Dodge-roll into potion pots</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll see green pots that have a healing potion inside them. While the most obvious route to breaking these open would be to hit them with your sword/axe/dagger/orb, one strategy I used during frantic boss fights was to just dodge-roll into them. This will still break the pot and have you grab the potion as you pass through it, and won’t lock you into a static animation that leaves you vulnerable to an attack. “Do a barrel roll, Rook!” - Varric, probably</p><h2 id="h314992"><a id=""></a><strong>Look for conversations around the Lighthouse, not just in companion rooms</strong></h2><p>For most of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s companion conversations, you can rely on lit-up lanterns outside each character’s quarters to know when your party members want to talk to you. However, a lot of banter and side conversations are happening around the Lighthouse throughout the game, and you’ll have to seek these exchanges out. You can see if some characters aren’t in their rooms through the map, so check it every time you come to the Lighthouse because folks are rarely in the same place twice. You can stumble upon party members talking to each other, or they might have an observation to share with you, so be sure to make your rounds every time you head back to home base.</p><h2 id="h314993"><a id=""></a><strong>Never sacrifice power for fashion or vice versa</strong></h2><p>We touched on how your fashion doesn’t have to be determined by your faction, but it also doesn’t have to be determined by stats. <em>The Veilguard </em>has a pretty straightforward transmog system that lets you equip your most powerful armor and weapons while also placing a custom appearance on top of it. My mage Rook sports a slick Shadow Dragon leather armor set while also getting the stats of ill-fitting metal armor meant for the tankiest of warriors. Best of both worlds, baby. You can edit your appearance in Rook’s room in their wardrobe.</p><h2 id="h314994"><a id=""></a><strong>You can change your appearance throughout the game</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s character creator is extensive, and odds are you’ll spend a lot of time making your Rook look exactly how you want them to. But if you start playing the game and find you don’t like how something looks, you can tweak your appearance at any point by examining the mirror in the infirmary. So don’t get so caught up in the finer details that you feel like you can’t actually start playing the game until your Rook looks “perfect.”</p><h2 id="h314995"><a id=""></a><strong>You can respec at any time</strong></h2><p>If you’re not feeling the abilities or specialization you’ve picked a few hours in, <em>The Veilguard </em>lets you respec from the Skills menu at any time. This is a good way to encourage experimentation and let you feel out every build option in the game. I was pretty happy with the dagger-based Spellblade specialization, but if I wanted to, I could reset all my Rook’s points and try out a drastically different play style without any drawbacks. So try things out without worrying that you’re committing to any one build.</p><figure id="" data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-recommend-id="image://a441954010decbde0605c0bbe8c2ef6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Davrin and Rook kiss as Assan walks toward them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h314996"><a id=""></a><strong>Romance has no restrictions</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> is known for its diverse romances that are also restricted based on gender and race. However, <em>The Veilguard </em>has no such restrictions. The sequel thankfully manages to avoid the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” trope</a></span> by establishing that each of its characters are pansexual rather than letting that just feel like something that’s defined by the player’s presence, but if you were concerned that you needed to play a certain gender or race to wife up your favorite companion, worry not.</p><h2 id="h314997"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t neglect the memory quests</strong></h2><p>There’s a series of quests in <em>The Veilguard </em>that I can’t believe is optional, but it is. Spread across The Crossroads, a hub that connects all the other regions you can explore in the game, these quests involve flashbacks to antagonist Solas’ past, and each one contains a debrief with the team that has some major <em>Dragon Age </em>lore drops. You’ll have to seek them out, so be on the lookout for translucent, glowing barriers throughout The Crossroads, as walking through these will give you a glimpse into the elven god’s past.</p><h2 id="h314998"><a id=""></a><strong>Read the missives</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an equivalent to <em>Mass Effect</em>’s email system called Missives. You’ll get pop-up notifications that you received a new one when you return to the Lighthouse after most quests. These letters will come from companions and people you met around Thedas, and give you some notable insight into things going on outside your field of view in the <em>Dragon Age</em> world. Unfortunately, they’re buried in the pause menu next to the codex, rather than somewhere like the email terminals in <em>Mass Effect</em>, so it can be easy to forget about them if you don’t make a point to seek them out.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-recommend-id="image://4fcbf9850acd216c620fc204b9b130fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook slices through a foe with a magic knife." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h314999"><a id=""></a><strong>Revives are attached to equipment</strong></h2><p>If you die in <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll notice there’s a “Revive” option next to the one that lets you reload a previous save. By default, you won’t be able to actually use the Revive function to stand right back up where you were in the fight, even as the game taunts you with the possibility on the game over screen. Revives are tied to rare pieces of equipment you’ll find for your companions. Having those revive charges will let your party members resuscitate you when you fall in battle, but that option will come at the expense of other utilities and upgrades. It’s a meaningful trade-off, but there was never a point where I wasn’t glad to have a revive on hand.</p><h2 id="h315000"><a id=""></a><strong>You can make your Rook trans, but you need to pick the option when you see it</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">We wrote about this already</a></span>, but if you missed it, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>has an option to explicitly make your Rook trans early in the game. When you set up your hero’s quarters, you’ll place a handheld mirror down and have a moment for self-reflection. Here you’re able to pick dialogue options that confirm your Rook is trans, which unlocks new dialogue options to discuss this with other characters. However, as far as I can tell, this is the only chance the game gives you to make this decision. If that’s the route you want to go with your Rook, don’t miss it.</p><h2 id="h315001"><a id=""></a><strong>You can import your Rook when you start a new playthrough, but there’s no New Game+</strong></h2><p>For some reason, <em>Dragon Age</em> games never have New Game+ and <em>The Veilguard </em>is no exception. However, BioWare did do one thing right on this front, as it still allows you to import your Rook’s appearance into new playthroughs. So if you’re like me and get attached to the characters you make and want to run them again in your second playthrough, you can do that, unlike in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games that made you recreate them every time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Amid a raft of announcement for new Apple hardware this week, developer CD Projekt has announced its bringing open-world sci-fi RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> to Macs "early next year".
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 originally released in December 2020 to, it would be fair to say, a decidedly mixed reception. Since then, however, CD Projekt has finessed its launch day offering, fixing bugs and expanding on some of the game's more heavily criticised elements (albeit jettisoning a promised multiplayer mode in the process), with the general sentiment being that Cyberpunk 2077 was in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">pretty great place</a> by the time last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion arrived.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Mac users should have a good time when Cyberpunk 2077 launches for the platform next year. It'll be available for all Apple Silicon devices via the Mac App Store and Steam, with CD Projekt <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50947/just-announced-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-coming-to-mac">promising</a> "advanced features like path tracing, frame generation, and built-in Spatial Audio for even more immersive gameplay and stunning visuals."

<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 arrives on Mac in the form of an Ultimate Edition, bundling together the base game and CD Projekt's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">called</a> an "instant recommendation if you enjoy the universe". Additionally, owners of Cyberpunk 2077 for PC on Steam will gain access to the Mac version when it launches.
</p><p>
Cyberpunk 2077's Mac release follows a bit of a push from Apple to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-is-mac-on-the-verge-of-a-gaming-revolution-cyberpunk-hogwarts-and-dead-space-tested-w-game-porting-toolkit">tempt more triple-A titles to its hardware</a> in recent times, with the likes of Resident Evil 7, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> all having comes to the company's computers and iOS devices in recent times. The results have been mixed from a technical perspective, as Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-death-strandings-ios-and-macos-ports-are-a-mixed-bag">been reporting</a>, and the iOS market has seemingly been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">reluctant to buy into full-price AAA games</a>. Still, with Capcom returning to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-2-remake-heading-to-iphone-and-mac-in-december">Resident Evil 2 Remake on Mac and iOS this December</a>, and CD Projekt having a go next year, publishers clearly see some potential.
</p>
<p>
Away from Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt is currently deep in development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (officially referred to as "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga"), with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">update in August</a> confirming pre-production was almost over and full production was due to start "soon".

She is here to excavate the titular barrow but soon encounters a series of events in the small village that discourage her endeavors. </p><figure id="" data-id="a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-recommend-id="image://a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1275" data-height="715" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A womans stands on a hill while a young girl plays the violin on a pile of rocks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A womans stands on a hill while a young girl plays the violin on a pile of rocks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wadjet Eye Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-recommend-id="image://a6508bfdc1f9bbb24d93d333179be229" data-format="jpg" data-width="1275" data-height="715" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A womans stands on a hill while a young girl plays the violin on a pile of rocks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Taking the form of a classic pixel adventure game (think the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-to-monkey-island-lucasarts-anniversary-1851653030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-monkey-island-lucasarts-anniversary-1851653030"><em>Monkey Island</em></a></span> series but less comedic), you step into the shoes of Thomasina on her journey in Bewlay. While the main goal is to dig at the barrow, the town’s web of residents and happenings sucks you in. Whether you are digging out on the moors, relaxing at the local tavern, or exploring the small town at night, the one constant is an overwhelming sense of smallness and dread in the isolated village.</p><p>Much like being on a ship at night and not seeing anything around for miles, the moors Thomasina finds herself in make Bewlay feel like the last bastion of humanity in any direction. The moors themselves are particularly threatening in their sprawling emptiness, which has led to folktales about them spreading amongst the villagers.

But none of that exists in <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>. Instead, there is an ever-prescient sense that you do not belong on the moors and that you cannot fathom the horrible things that lurk within them. The atmosphere of the game unnerves you at every turn but makes going down the rabbit hole enticing thanks to a well-written central mystery. For anybody looking for something more unique to play for Halloween, this is the game for you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In contrast, the spirit entity known as Hyoki, exists solely to eliminate every Slitterhead. As the fight unfolds, secrets about this world will be revealed, intertwining the fates of both humans and creatures in a narrative that gradually unveils the complexities of humanity itself. </p><p>Slitterheads are mysterious creatures lurking in Kowlong, posing a threat to civilization. After consuming a human brain, they mimic the head and animate the corpse to disguise themselves as humans.</p><p>When preying on humans, they take on a “Pupal Form,” with the human head replaced by a grotesque visage, extending tentacles to target their prey’s brain. Slitterheads acquire memory and genetic information from the human brain, allowing them to imitate personalities. Each Slitterhead’s behavior varies, ranging from aimlessly wandering the streets to manipulating humans at the core of large organizations.</p><p><em>—Pupal Form</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_055.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_056.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_057.jpg"></a></figure><p>When the human body they inhabit suffers damage, they switch to a new victim’s body. However, they cannot operate independently or for long periods away from a host.</p><p>When they sense danger, they absorb the host’s bodily fluids to grow into a “Complete Form,” exposing their true nature and significantly increasing their power. They have integrated genes from various mimetic organisms, including insects, fish, and mollusks, resulting in a diverse range of appearances. While they primarily adopt a mantis-like posture, they can alter their form based on the situation, standing upright on two legs or climbing through gaps like a spider.</p><p><em>—Common Octopus Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_058.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_059.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Warty Frogfish Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_060.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_061.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Orchid Mantis Slitterhead</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_062.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_063.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Himomushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_064.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_065.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Dokumushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_066.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_067.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Tamamushi</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_068.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-30-24_069.jpg"></a></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/novembers-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-deathwire-tokyo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony is keeping the spooky season going with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for November 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, an anime spin-off and some toy car racing – this last one’s not horror…</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus November 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 5th November.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/"><strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/"><strong>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged</strong></a> (PS5|PS4)</li>
<li><strong>Death Note Killer Within</strong> (PS5|PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is in intriguing spooky time in Tokyo, with plenty of Japanese mythology fed into a first person action game.&nbsp;We scored in the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/">8/10 in our review</a>, with Nick saying “Ghostwire: Tokyo was not the game I was expecting from Tango Gameworks, but I definitely enjoyed it. Blending magic-filled FPS action with Japanese mythology and an open world Tokyo that reminds me of the Yakuza series, it stands out from the crowd even if it’s not truly groundbreaking. Ghostwire has a lot of potential as a new franchise and I’m looking forward to seeing what Tango Gameworks does with it next.”</p>

<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo was one of the last Bethesda games signed to PlayStation exclusivity before Microsoft snapped up the publisher. Not only that, but it’s ended up being the penultimate game from Tango Gameworks before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/xbox-exec-tells-staff-they-want-more-smaller-games-just-like-hi-fi-rush-one-day-after-closing-its-studio/">Microsoft decided to close the company</a> – though it’s now been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">saved by Krafton</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside that is the high-octane arcade racing of Hot Wheels Unleashed 2, a souped up sequel that delighted Ade in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-review/">our review</a>. he said, “Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged is like Hot Wheels Unleashed, but better in every single conceivable way. Frenetically fluid and stonkingly fast, this is a quality arcade racer that will slap smiles on the faces of both young and old alike. Just don’t mention the single-player campaign.”</p>

<p>And the month is rounded out by Death Note Killer Within, a social deduction game based on the popular murder book anime series. With up to 10 players, you’ll be split into two teams with different objectives, either to eliminate L or seize the Death Note, while also trying to figure out everyone’s identities from varying roles and characteristics. That certainly sounds a lot like the high stakes intrigue of the source material!</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the October 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab October’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 5th November October, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

<p>The 2025 season for Valorant Challengers is just around the corner, and in a recent press release, Riot Games unveiled some new changes and updates to the format and schedule for the APAC region. Here is everything we know as of now. </p>



<h2 id="h-academy-teams-to-join-valorant-challengers-in-2025">Academy Teams to Join Valorant Challengers in 2025</h2>



<p>In its official press release, Riot Games expressed the desire to “deepen its development pipeline” and will implement Academy Teams into the Challengers Leagues across the APAC region (Asia-Pacific).</p>



<p>The goal is for this change to allow teams to scout for new talent beforehand, allowing them to test and develop their rosters. However, Riot Games made it exceptionally clear that they still want to give opportunities to new teams trying to join the VCT Pacific. </p>



<p>Academy Teams will be able to participate in Challengers, but they will not be able to qualify for Ascension Pacific.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-participating-teams">Participating Teams</h2>



<p>The following teams have opted to have Academy Teams in their regional leagues:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Challengers Korea – DRX, Gen.G, T1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Japan – Zeta Division, DFM</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers Southeast Asia – RRQ, Talon, Team Secret</strong></li>



<li><strong>Challengers South Asia – Global Esports</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The partnered teams who opt-in will be given a direct slot in their Challengers League for 2025.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-riot-releases-2025-apac-schedule">Riot Releases 2025 APAC Schedule</h2>



<p>Riot Games has also revealed the 2025 APAC Calendar which includes three splits that will lead into Ascension.</p>



<p>Academy Teams will have the chance to play alongside their respective teams during these tournaments but will not be able to participate in Ascension.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More information about the upcoming 2025 schedule will be unveiled later on as we round the corner of the year. Will you be watching the 2025 VCT season?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-want-you-to-design-levels-for-them-but-they-won%E2%80%99t-pay-you.1023318/</guid>

<p>The developers behind the failed extraction shooter The Day Before are asking people to design levels for its next game. Fntastic took to its Discord server (h/t <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-studio-now-asking-community-to-design-maps-for-free-in-newly-launched-contest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) to announce a “contest” for people to design a map for its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fntastics-latest-game-attempt-fails-so-they-announce-another-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest attempt at a game</a>, ITEMS.</p>



<p>The catch is, the winner of the contest won’t be paid for their work.</p>



<p>“This contest is a chance for you to unleash your creativity by designing a map that, if it wins, will be added to the game in future updates,” the announcement read.</p>



<p>Rules for participating in the “contest” were then laid out, which includes stating that submissions can be 2D drawings, 3D models, or “any other style”. In addition to the map design, submissions need to also include images and artwork, a full description, the map’s theme, layoff, and “balance considerations”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The kicker, as mentioned earlier, is that the person who creates the winning submission won’t receive any payment for the time put into designing the map. Instead, they’ll simply get a copy of the game — if it ever releases –, the map built for use in the game, and their name displayed “somewhere” on the map.</p>



<p>As of publishing, six maps have been submitted.</p>



<h2 id="h-fntastic-s-history-with-fan-submissions">Fntastic’s History With Fan Submissions</h2>



<p>Fntastic looking for fan submissions for its map designs isn’t something new for the studio. During the development of The Day Before, the studio regularly used unpaid volunteers for the development of its game. Those volunteers were located in various countries, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Finland, and more.</p>



<p>At one point, the studio claimed to be using over 100 full time volunteers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fntastic holding a contest for maps for its new game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forum.</p>

While nothing has been confirmed by Activision, players now believe the rumored map can be seen while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Avalon is a large-scale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-leaks-reveal-a-controversial-warzone-map-with-caldera-2-0-vibes/1100-6525560/">map that leaked with some controversy</a>, as the design includes islands separated with lots of water, giving Caldera 2.0 vibes. Now, players are discovering that using Black Ops 6's spectator mode lets them see a rendered version of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Players are loading into private matches on Black Ops 6's Lowtown map and using the game's Codcaster setting, which lets them fly out of bounds and explore areas beyond the playable map. This reveals that Lowtown is part of a much larger Warzone-style map. Pieces of this map include older multiplayer maps from previous Black Ops games, such as Firing Range, WMD, and Hacienda. It also includes a view of the cluster of islands as revealed from the previous leaks of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" rel="nofollow ">reported by CharlieIntel</a>, a fan has even gone to the lengths to create a speculative overhead map with named points-of-interest.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The upcoming Warzone map, which is rumored for Fall 2025, can be seen in Black Ops 6's Theater Mode if you go into spectating. <br>Fans have speculated the different POIs based on the locations. <br>Image: u/Dull-Caterpillar3153 <a href="https://t.co/Vfu4YwPv8A" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Vfu4YwPv8A</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While it is very likely that this is the rumored Avalon map for Warzone, it's uncertain when or if this map will arrive in the game.

                <p>Google is celebrating Halloween with a brand new installment of Magic Cat Academy--marking the third edition of the Doodle. In the past, Momo the cat has taken on <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2016/" rel="nofollow "><u>ghouls in school</u></a> and taken a <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2020/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deep dive</a> to tackle sea monsters. This year, Google pits Momo against ghosts and space creatures as she battles her arch nemesis, Marshmallow the ghost, across the cosmos.</p><p>The rules of the game are simple: Draw the designated lines to defeat ghosts and other monsters across five stages. The lines and their sequence get more difficult as the game progresses, but you can always draw a heart to get more life, you just have to be quick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427" data-ratio="0.56288659793814" data-width="1455" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png"></figure><p>After every level, there's a small scientific fact about the level of the atmosphere and something that the level focused on like stars or the flying fox bat. Google even included a gallery of concept art ranging from level design to dropped ideas like Momo and Marshmallow becoming a giant mech and teaming up. There's also a photo of the real-life Momo lounging around.</p><p>The game will run through October 31, 11:59 PM ET. You can also learn more about this Doodle, Momo's other adventures, and past Doodles <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony has announced its PlayStation Plus monthly lineup for November, and it includes a day one release for an all-new Death Note game.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/30/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-ghostwire-tokyo-death-note-killer-within/?sf275244630=1">PlayStation</a>, PS Plus subscribers on the Premium, Extra, and Essential tiers will be able to get their hands on the following three games from 5th November:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 - Turbocharged</li>
<li>Ghostwire: Tokyo</li>
<li>Death Note Killer Within</li>
</ul>

<p>The standout here is surely Death Note Killer Within, which Bandai Namco only announced today. It is described as the "first-ever social deduction game based on the legendary anime series".</p>
<p>The online game has cross-play support, and will see up to 10 players face a choice between life and death.</p>
<p>"Split into two teams, players must uncover each other’s identities to eliminate L or seize the Death Note from Kira," reads the official blurb. "Kira and L are equally matched, each hiding their true identity while battling for control over the game. Engage in a game of wits either as Kira and his follower, or L and the investigators, as both sides vie for the hidden Death Note, leading to a thrilling showdown of truth and deception until one team prevails."</p><p>Players can take on the role of either Kira, L, Kira Follower or Investigator on the game's release, with each role giving the chance to experience "unique gameplay characteristics". You can check out a trailer for Death Note Killer Within above.</p>
<p>In addition to PlayStation (where it can also be purchased separately), Death Note Killer Within will also be coming to PC via Steam on 5th November. We previously got wind of this new Death Note game earlier in the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-death-note-game-rated-in-taiwan-for-playstation-consoles">thanks to a rating in Taiwan</a>.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has started arriving in stores ahead of next week's launch, as confirmed by pictures making the rounds online.</p>
<p>One of the pictures, which can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pDdR1vP">here</a>, shows the front and back of the system's box, which provides information on the box's content and the system's basic features. Funnily enough, the 8K sticker that was found on the base model's launch box is nowhere to be seen, highlighting how that crazy high resolution is no longer considered a marketing point, even though the system is actually capable of running games at 8K resolution, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a>, unlike the base model.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you need to know more about the PlayStation 5 Pro box, Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999027/20241029053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> posted a hilarious review of it, highlighting how the white hardware and text stand out against the seductive black color of the box and how it has a very PlayStation-like fragrance, and providing a comparison with boxes for previous generation consoles and the base PS5 models. Even with an automated translation, it is still a very entertaining read, so make sure to check it out if you need something to tide you over until the release of the system and the posting of proper reviews of the system.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

Players will capture objectives, navigate the fog of war, manage vital resources, gain different types of Requisition points, use them to deploy their forces.</p>

<p>No prior experience with Bolt Action is required. <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> is a standalone board game experience. In fact, Warlord Games designed this game to lower obstacles for those interested in the hobby of wargaming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone wants to assemble and paint miniatures before they play a game, so we're taking<br>
those obstacles away for Vanguard: Normandy whilst creating a board game that still feels like<br>
Bolt Action. By adapting the unit activation and pin mechanisms, the game will have a familiarity<br>
to Bolt Action players - the rest of the game, however, is brand new!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A copy of<em> Vanguard: Normandy</em> will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>More than 50 pre-assembled and pre-painted US and German miniatures, including armored vehicles</li>
	<li>15 Double-sided interlocking hex boards</li>
	<li>Fully detailed unit information cards</li>
	<li>Full color rules, campaign books, and punchboards</li>
	<li>A set of custom dice and wooden counters</li>
</ul><p>The crowdfunding campaign for <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> will go live on Kickstarter November 5. If you sign up to the game's mailing list before it goes live, you will receive an exclusive dice tray at no additional charge alongside the campaign's fulfillment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zero-orders-tactics-is-a-clever-turn-based-god-sim-with-a-touch-of-from-dust.1023264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zero-orders-tactics-is-a-clever-turn-based-god-sim-with-a-touch-of-from-dust<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Classic god sims like Populous and Black &amp; White teach that deities love to reach their horrible holy hands into our world and mess with us directly. They teach us to see 1-1 divine intervention in every random house fire and every lightning bolt that miraculously strikes our enemies. By contrast, the forthcoming Zero Orders Tactics teaches that god prefers to operate via covert means, because after all, personally lobbing some electricity at somebody would be <em>inelegant</em>. It's far more graceful to trap them behind a mountain, instead.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Developed by Pauloondra - whose weighty works include the well-received arcade physics smasher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1018130/Castle_Break/">Castle Break</a> - Zero Orders Tactics is a hexagonal turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game in which friendly units always move from left to right, enemies always more from right to left, and your job is to alter the terrain in between so that the forces of light prevail. In other words, it's an autobattler where you fox the geography to suit the quirks and foibles of your battlers.</p>
<p>For example, a perfidious goblin is menacing a princess as she walks along a road to a castle. One way you could intervene is to conjure up some cavalry, but ah, even given the "goodies go first" rule, they won't reach your ambling damsel in time. However! That goblin is very partial to flat green countryside. If you swap a nearby mountain for some meadows, you can lull the pesky varmint into walking in the opposite direction. 
</p>
<p>
Now, imagine there are several of these units on the board, each with specific preferences about what they walk on, and different criteria for performing an attack. Where will you bestow your forests, your swamps, your hilltops so as to pluck the needle of victory from this haystack of competing pathfinding?
</p><p>
I've just given the demo a quick shake and it seems quite promising. The visuals and sound aren't anything to write home about - certainly, nothing like as marvelous as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-from-dust">From Dust</a>, which also favours tactical terraforming over moving units around - but the mechanics are swiftly engrossing. I think part of it is that once you've done the brainwork, you get to sit back magisterially and watch the pieces fall as predicted, which feels very divine. Yes, god has a plan for you <em>too</em>, rando minotaur in the woods.</p>
<p>The full game has a roguelite campaign with the chance to build up a deck of terrain types and units. It's out on 4th November, and you can find the Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1877650/Zero_Orders_Tactics/">here</a>.

The art style looks like a mashup of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> miniatures, and the gameplay revolves around rows of characters battling it out with turn-based abilities in search of XP and loot. Players grow their champions or craft new ones and can then sell them on a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto-backed marketplace</a></span>. </p><p>Here’s the gameplay trailer:</p><p>While the most expensive champion currently listed has an asking price of $63K, or about 1.9 million gold, many of the most recently listed ones are going for anywhere from $5 to around $200. The way cryptocurrency game economies tend to work is that players invest money to get stronger teams to win more matches to make their collectibles more valuable in the hopes of then turning around and selling them to newer recruits.

The French publisher has been keeping at it, though, in case the gaming genre ever does blow up into something bigger. </p><p>Weirdly, <em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles </em>lists an age rating of “adults only” in one of its trailers. A spokesperson for the ESRB told <em>IGN</em> that this was an error, and the game hasn’t officially been rated at all yet. It’s still unclear how successful the game will be, or if that will even matter for Ubisoft’s ongoing blockchain ambitions. The fact that <em>Champions Tactics</em> revolves around an NFT economy isn’t even the worst thing it has going for it. That would instead be the fact that you can currently only play it by downloading the company’s Ubisoft Connect launcher, which to some is even more disqualifying than needing to connect a crypto wallet. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Although Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones doesn't seem to have any pets during his globetrotting years, the third film--Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade--established that Indy once had a dog named Indiana that he loved very much. And Indy's love for dogs is one reason why he won't be shooting any enemy canines in Bethesda and MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-much-nicer-to-its-dogs-than-wolfenstein" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, MachineGames Creative Director Jens Andersson confirmed that Indy's encounters with dogs owned by the bad guys won't end the same way they did in the developers' Wolfenstein games. Instead, Indy can scare off the dogs by pointing his weapon at them, rather than actually following through on the threat.</p><p>"[Indiana Jones] is a dog person," said Andersson. "This is obviously a little bit different than Wolfenstein as well, where the dog will explode... It's a family-friendly IP in many ways. How do we do that well? Well, these are the kind of things that we do. We have dogs as enemies, but you don't really hurt the dogs. You scare them away."</p><p>That's fortunate for the canines, but less so for Doctor Jones.

The enemy dogs may prove to be another challenge for Indy to remain undetected by Nazi soldiers.

As part of this game, Indy can also take out Nazis with stealth attacks and improvised weapons.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9.

            <p>An unannounced Warzone map has seemingly leaked, and is explorable in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>The latest Call of Duty game released last week, and players are already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-says-it-is-investigating-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-issues">discovering some unintentional extras and niggles</a>, such as that aforementioned map which is reportedly called "Avalon".</p>

<p>Players have accessed Avalon by implementing CODcaster mode in a private match, and using the dockside neighbourhood Lowtown as a starting point. Following these steps, players have managed to essentially go out of bounds, and fly over the yet-to-be-announced Warzone map.</p>

<p>Avalon is rumoured to be the Warzone map for 2025, and reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dull-Caterpillar3153/">Dull-Caterpillar3153</a> has laid out the various locations within the map itself (below).</p>
<p>"As you can see there's a lot of classic Black Ops maps that will appear on this map including Firing Range, Hacienda and WMD," the poster wrote. </p>
<p>Eurogamer asked Activision for further comment on this leak, however the company declined.</p>

			<p>In a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">developer diary</a> for Titan Quest II, those who are excited about the game get to find out more about the Skills and Modifiers that will be available in the game. Players will be given a chance to combine any two masteries to create their own class to help them stand out from the ground and provide them with a unique class. When Early Access begins (which is slated for <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">Winter 2024</a>), players will have access to Earth, Storm, and Warfare masteries. As the game begins to be updated during the Early Access period, there will be more masteries available, providing new and returning players with the opportunity to mix up their class type further and create something new.</p>
<p>In the new Titan Quest II dev diary, players are given a preview into some of the skills that will be available, alongside the modifiers that can drastically change the game for the player. While some of the Modifiers available are passive tweaks that work in the background, some of them are active, and can turn an attack from a sweeping strike into a whirlwind attack, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to skills, players will be able to equip a maximum of 10 skills to the ability bar, allowing for a varied playstyle. This means that you can have a primary damage type and have your other skills be defensive and supportive skills that can provide synergies to your damaging skills. Of course, as previously mentioned, there will be skill trees for players to explore, which helps players decide between active or passive skills and modifiers, which can help bring your character from zero to hero.</p>
<p>In the dev diary that is posted on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/4445708897933590548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog</a>, there are videos that show examples of how the different masteries work and how the modifiers interact with the different masteries. For example, there is a video that shows off Earth Mastery and how you can use modifiers to create a Lava Fissure skill that produces a line AoE on the floor, dealing strike damage to your enemy, as well as dealing fire damage. Of course, since the skill has been modified, it will cost extra energy. There are also further tweaks you can make, such as the Additional Fissures modifier which reduces your overall damage, but allows you to spawn in extra fissures to cover more ground.</p>

<p>There are plans to showcase more gameplay footage in the future, when more dev diaries are released for Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>Will you be getting this game in the Early Access period? Let us know in the comments.</p>

It’s a hand-me-down from a bygone era, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031">like the AK-74</a></span>, but one that offers enough customization and versatility to make it viable on any battlefield. It also proves itself as one of the more capable weapons for new players to grasp in <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>With the right attachments, perks, and Wildcard, the XM4 dominates any game mode with ease, with a relatively low TTK (time to kill), manageable recoil, and, as mentioned, versatility in its available attachments to satisfy any play style.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-recommend-id="image://1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-recommend-id="image://1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite being the stock weapon the game provides you with upon launching into multiplayer, the XM4 offers endless possibilities. It’s highly customizable, potent, and accurate, making it the ideal starter assault rifle for new players. But most importantly, even long-time veteran players will find it a viable weapon in competitive scenes, too.</p><p>With the right attachments, the XM4 will help you dominate any game mode, but it excels in larger maps with spacious shooting lanes. After all, this is an assault rifle and not a submachine gun or shotgun, so while it can handle an enemy in close quarters with some luck, you’ll find it most effective at range.</p><p>To improve the viability of the XM4, opt for these attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: CHF Barrel</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Ergonomic Grip</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li></ul><p>With the Gunfighter perk active, add the following attachments to your XM4 for a more well-rounded, potent weapon:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Accu-Spot Reflex</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Combat Stock</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-recommend-id="image://968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-recommend-id="image://968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you work on leveling up your XM4, you won’t have many valuable attachments immediately.

Other than that, the goal is to reduce weapon sway and horizontal recoil as much as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-recommend-id="image://1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-recommend-id="image://1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For this XM4 build, we want to take the following Perks, Wildcard, and Equipment:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho (Increases Sprint and Tactical Sprint while reloading or utilizing Equipment)</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Dexterity (Reduces overall weapon sway while jumping, diving, or diving)</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time (Doubles the overall duration of Tactical Sprint)</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Enforcer (Killing enemies grants a temporary speed buff and increases health regen rate)</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li><li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>: Frag Grenade</li><li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>: Stim Shot</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Assault Pack</li></ul><p>As mentioned previously, opting for the Gunfighter Wildcard will allow you to utilize three additional weapon attachment slots.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-recommend-id="image://af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-recommend-id="image://af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you rank up in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, you’ll have plenty of time to learn the ins and outs of the XM4.

The device’s WiFi is already crap, so downloads pausing in sleep mode was especially annoying. Imagine <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> comes out at midnight. You initiate the installation and go to sleep and eight hours later it’s somehow <em>still</em> downloading?</p><p>The other bug fix in the update likely impacted many fewer players, but will be a godsend all the same for <em>Smash Bros.</em> fans. The console was having a tough time recently recognizing GameCube controllers attached using adapters, a common enough thing for fans of the platform fighter raised on its <em>Melee</em> incarnation. It sounds like those connection issues are resolved now as well.</p><p>Now all the Switch needs is a sleep mode that uses way less battery when there aren’t things downloading. The only thing worse than waiting for a game to install is coming back to your Switch and seeing the battery life in the single digits. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">Hopefully the Switch 2</a></span> is able to tap into whatever dark magic was powering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-vitas-sleep-mode-is-pure-sorcery-1830753209?_gl=1*1874cou*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDI5MzY3Mi41MS4xLjE3MzAzMDAzNDMuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-vitas-sleep-mode-is-pure-sorcery-1830753209?_gl=1*1874cou*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDI5MzY3Mi41MS4xLjE3MzAzMDAzNDMuNjAuMC4w">PlayStation Vita’s power-saving mode</a></span>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you are hoping for EA to release Apex Legends 2, you might want to let go of that hope for now. </p>



<p>During its latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about what the company’s plans were involving Apex Legends in order to regain a player base that has been steadily declining. One of those questions involved the possibility of doing a full rebuild of the game, and launching an Apex 2.0, of sorts.”</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson said. </p>



<p>“And so actually, the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have and deliver the new innovative creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they’ve made or the investment that they have put into the existing ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Wilson then went on to say that EA’s goal is to “innovate in the core experience” of Apex Legends. He said that it’s been seen as seasons move forward and continue to grow. </p>



<p>“[W]e’re changing kind of key modalities at play within those seasons and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers,” he said. “And we think we can do those two things together, and we don’t believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so.”</p>



<p>Wilson also said that he, and the company, believe that Apex Legends is in an “incredibly good position” moving forward. Specifically, he mentioned the ability of the game to reach the “very top tier” of the genre while having a “strong brand”, “strong mechanic”, and a “very committed global community”.</p>



<p>Despite no plans for a completely new Apex Legends game, Wilson admitted that there is a need for changes to the game in order to keep that community happy and engaged with the game for months and years to come.</p>



<p>“We’ve also observed is a need for kind of meaningful systematic innovation in the game that fundamentally changes the way the game plays more broadly and our teams are working on that as well,” he said.</p>



<p>As far as what those innovations could be, that wasn’t mentioned. It was only reiterated that the “team is working through” it.</p>
