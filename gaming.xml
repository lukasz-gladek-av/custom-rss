		<p>With rumours and reports of a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake having circulated for years at this point, the latest has come directly from developer Virtuos, with screenshots and details coming from their website.</p>
<p>Further to the screenshots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer has also now reported</a> that Bethesda’s plan is to shadow drop the game next week, launching it across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC – and on Xbox Game Pass, of course.</p>


<p>The images were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they’ve now been <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">copied across to imgur</a>, while the studio has taken their site offline. We’ll point you toward imgur if you want to see the full selection, but here’s one example:</p>

<p>There’s definitely an awful lot more detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>

<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and it will be fascinating to see how it comes together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>I guess we won’t have too long to wait…</p>

			<p>Strong as<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/"> South of Midnight's</a> story is, reading every note along the way really does add to the storytelling in a special way. Which is why you'll want to read them all, even if you're just trying to find them for the achievement.</p>
<p>These guides will tell you where to find every note in the game, all 103 of them, across South of Midnight's 14 chapters.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 5</h2>
<p>If you've been following along with the rest of these guides, then you'll recognize that Chapter 5 has more notes than any level so far. Here's where to grab all 11 of Chapter 5's notes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's Pieces of the Self—</strong>The first note of the chapter is found right after you've found Crouton, in the hollow tree immediately next to where you'll send Crouton to do away with the stigma.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Statue Flyer</strong> - After continuing further into the level, and completing the first combat encounter (which will also show you the first memory), you'll find this note on a broken fence post, just below the giant Auntie Belle's sign and statue.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Iron</strong> - You'll find this note just in front of Jolene's church, after the cutscene with Ms. Pearle and Jolene. It will be on top of a box that's next to the fence, which will be immediately to your right once the cutscene ends.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollow Dreamers</strong> - After grabbing the last note, follow the path the strands layout for you across the water towards a house that's covered in vines. The note will be on a couch that sits on the porch of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Kids Need a Hand</strong> - After fighting your first Slug Haint (the big round enemy that digs underground) and seeing the second memory for the chapter, you'll find this note inside the house that'll be right in front of you, and on the table to your left when you walk through the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Jo's Penance</strong> - Before leaving the house, walk up the stairs to the second floor, and head to the room at the end of the hall, which will also be the only room left open for you to walk into. You'll find this note on a desk with a guitar leaning against it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yard Sale Notice</strong> - This note is a little further into the level, and you won't be able to get to it until you've reached Swopes Farm. To reach it, you'll first have to use an echo box to climb a high tower where you'll find a Floof knot. From this vantage, you'll also be able to see over a tall stack of hay bales. Jump over the hay bales to the other side, and turn left towards a trailer, then right towards a small cabin. You'll find this note resting on a folding chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Honor thy Father and Mother</strong> - Once you're back to where you climbed the high tower, head towards the big house on your right. The door will open when you get close, and you'll find this note in what looks like the family room immediately to your right when you walk in.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bashful Farmhand in the Setting Sun</strong> - Before leaving the house, head up to the second floor, where you'll find a Floof knot in one room, and this note on a desk next to a typewriter in the other.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Pigs are a Loss</strong> - When you make it to the Pig Factory, inside the factory you'll enter a room with a Floof knot on top of a container to your left. The note, on the other hand, is on ground level, sitting on a table immediately to the right of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sutter's Will and Testament</strong> - After the Two-Toed Tom boss fight, and after you've been swallowed up by the giant gator, you'll find this note once you've made it to the other side of the pool the squealing pig from earlier is swimming in. It's on the wooden floor, next to a lamp.</p>
<p>That's all 11 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 5. If you've been following along with these guides, then you'll have acquired 28 out of 103 now. Only 75 more to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-frontier-games-shuts-down-amid-financial-struggles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Final Frontier Games is closing down. The Macedonia-based tabletop developer is closing after nearly a decade of producing board games. This closure results from five years of financial struggle, leaving three crowdfunded projects unfulfilled.</p>

<h2>The Closure of Final Frontier Games</h2>

<p>The news of Final Frontier Games' closure came from a backer update sent via their Kickstarter projects. That update was made public <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jzorko/final_frontier_games_laying_off_and_declaring/" rel="nofollow">via post</a> on the r/boardgames subreddit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-frontier-games-merchants-cove-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=nnBqFpVl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-frontier-games-merchants-cove-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=KQ5v1mRQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the backer update, Final Frontier Games states that cash has been tight for a while and after a large order for Chinese localized copies of <em>Merchants Cove</em> fell through, they cannot fulfill the Kickstarter projects that have been fulfilled. The post continues, citing other compounding production issues behind the scenes that eroded their finances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We cannot understate the gravity of the situation and the suddenness of the fall of the company. We are emotionally devastated, sad, we are hurting, we are angry and there is a big hole in our hearts that will take a long time to overcome, if ever. Just recently we were tweaking ads for our next campaign, talking with reviewers, preparing for production on our other games, developing our future projects and entering a distribution partnership with QML, something that we had lacked for 4 years… hoping that the payment will come through.</p>

<p>All our dreams and hopes vanished. 10 families that put food on the table through Final Frontier Games that had stable, creative and good paying jobs are now faced with extreme uncertainty with no financial stability. We are truly living in the darkest timeline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of these developments, Final Frontier Games' three current Kickstarter projects - <em>Merchants Cove: Master Craft</em>, <em>The Sixth Realm</em>, and a <em>Coloma </em>reprint, have remained unfulfilled despite funding of $1.39 million. This is the culmination of protracted financial struggles for the company going back to their first Merchants Cove Kickstarter suffering serious production issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>According to FInal Frontier Games, the order that fell through was with tabletop giant CMON. The update stated that CMON had initially agreed to pay 50% before production then the remainder after the process was complete. Allegedly, this deal was changed to paying the entirety once the games were ready to be picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Frontier agreed to this change. But, according to them, the last possible day for payment came and went with no contact from CMON. Despite multiple emails being sent, no one at CMON got back to them regarding payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CMON has yet to make an official statement or comment at the time of writing.</p>

It's been a little over a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palia">Palia</a> had its proper launch, and its next big update, the Elderwood Expansion, received a little reveal today. This update is mostly focused on a new area, the titular Elderwood, and it'll be free for everyone. That doesn't mean everyone will be able to play it right off the bat though, as it's designed for higher level players that have already beaten the main story (you can still head there beforehand if you're impatient).
</p>

<p>
Looking at the trailer I'd say that the big theme here is the colour purple. It's everywhere, that's just the vibe of the place I suppose. In terms of actual additions, outside of the new area itself, there's apparently a new story. There's some kind of essence infecting the area, but story details are pretty light right now.

You'll find a couple new creatures to track down like the Ogapuu and Smole (yes, these are their names), and there are hidden artifacts that can net you some strong relics, a "new equipment system that buffs you and your party." On top of that there's new fish, insects, and plushies too. It seems like a pretty sizable update, one that feels surprising to be completely free, but hey, the whole idea is that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a>, so, no complaints here!
</p>
<p>
The update is arriving pretty soon too, on May 13, where it'll be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. I mention this only because the game has cross-play, so if you've got some console buds that have been wanting to check Palia out, now might be the time to give them a nudge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-just-picked-up-a-pokmon-tcg-151-booster-bundle-direct-from-amazon-and-its-still-in-stock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But you'll have to pay a premium...</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I noticed Pokémon 151 booster bundles are back on Amazon, and I’d love to say that means good news for collectors. But when the price is more than double the MSRP, it's more of a raised eyebrow than a celebration. Amazon is listing the bundle for over $60, despite its actual retail price being $26.94. I guess we're calling that a "deal" now. Still, given how fast this set sells out, I can't entirely write it off.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-151-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle Is Back In Stock For A Premium</h2></p><div catalogid="73e0a0eb-2c53-4af8-acce-e01289366c6e" id="218750"><div id="218750" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Full Disclosure: MSRP is $26.94</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think what keeps pulling me back to 151 is that it's not just banking on nostalgia. It actually delivers. The card art in this set goes way beyond the usual shiny-thing-on-a-blank-background look. Take the Illustration Rare Bulbasaur, for example. It’s hiding in a jungle of giant leaves like it wandered into a Ghibli movie, and it works. Then there's Alakazam ex, who looks like it's working on a psychic PhD in a cluttered study. It's oddly charming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, the strongest part of this set is how it ties art and gameplay together without feeling like it’s trying too hard. Cards like Blastoise ex have solid abilities and look like they belong in a gallery. Even Charmander got an upgrade. The new one has 70 HP, which might not sound like a big deal, but it’s enough to keep it alive against chip damage that would've knocked out weaker versions. Subtle but important, which kind of sums up a lot of this set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything hits. Zapdos ex is fine, but I wouldn’t frame it or build a deck around it. Still, the overall quality is high. Venusaur ex leans into both function and flair, while Squirtle’s artwork pulls off that rare trick of making a cartoon turtle look like it belongs in an actual ecosystem. It’s hard not to appreciate how much care went into these designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t love paying above MSRP, but I also don’t love pretending this set isn’t loaded. I think if you’ve been waiting for packs that are genuinely fun to open and have a real shot at high-value pulls, this is still one of the better buys. Assuming you're okay with the price of admission being whatever Amazon feels like charging today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Its presentation was packed with content to look forward to, but it’s Season 3: Guts and Glory that promises the land combat feature players have hoped to see included since Skull and Bones originally launched last February.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During Season 3 this fall, Ubisoft will finally allow players to take the action away from the sea, meaning you’ll be able to swordfight and even draw your firearms against others. It’s all part of Season 3’s Rogue Warlord additions, which will see players setting foot on sandy beaches and damp caves to rescue skilled crewmembers known as Officers. A video teasing the feature showed a bit of what players can expect, but it’s clear we’ll have to wait until later this year to see how it all works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While land combat is by far the biggest addition coming with Skull and Bones Year 2, the presentation had plenty more to keep players digging throughout 2025. Season 1 sets sail today, April 15, with Ascent into Chaos, which adds a loot-enhancing item ascension feature, challenging World Tiers, a new Schooner medium ship, and the team-based Death Tides PvP mode. Season 2: Oaths of War, which launches summer 2025, includes highlights such as Megaforts and the gargantuan Frigate large ships, with Season 4: Eye of the Beast set to introduce the Kraken, Hunter’s Guild, and Corvette large ship this winter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If everything you’ve heard sounds enticing enough to dive in, you’ll be happy to know Skull and Bones will launch a free weekend in just a few days. From April 17 – 21, players can raise sails to try out pirate PvP for themselves and also purchase the game at a reduced price (which has yet to be announced).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skull and Bones launched February 16, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S (we gave it a 7/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-review"><u>our review</u></a>). Although Ubisoft has been reluctant to share official sales stats for its latest pirate adventure game, it did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-skull-and-bones-has-record-player-engagement-but-fails-to-announce-sales"><u>tease that it managed to bring in “record player engagement” shortly after its release</u></a>. Interestingly, the launch of Skull and Bones also coincided with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-players-rise-200-upon-skull-and-bones-release"><u>a 200% increase in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag players</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> will soon add the ability to leash together mobs to each other or objects, opening up new possibilities for how players engage with the game's voxel-based world.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained in a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unleash-your-imagination" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> on the Minecraft website, the ability to lead a single mob with a leash has existed for some time. The upcoming changes to the feature, however, will greatly expand what can be done with leashes, allowing players to tie mobs together and attach them to a wider variety of objects.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4477072-minecraftleashingupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477072" data-ratio="0.56244131455399" data-width="1065" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4477072-minecraftleashingupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477072"></a><figcaption>An example of how leashes can be used to turn Happy Ghasts into hot air balloons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4477072-minecraftleashingupdate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The blog gives examples of leashing horses together or using leashes to turn friendly Happy Ghasts into hot air balloons. While some leash functionality, like the ability to tie a leash to a fence, isn't new, changes to how they work are. It will be easier to add and remove leashes from knots, and players looking to remove one particular mob from a leashed group can use shears to do so. Keep in mind, players can't leash together other players or use shears to mess with someone else's leashes.</p><p dir="ltr">All the new leashing functionality is available for testing now for those using Minecraft: Java Edition, with testing coming to the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition realms on Xbox, Windows, Android, and iOS soon, developer Mojang said. A release date for when the feature would come to all users hasn't been announced.</p><p dir="ltr">To test the feature, players will need to enable snapshots for Minecraft: Java Edition and install it via the Minecraft launcher. For those looking to test on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, players will need to opt in to preview/beta and download those specific test versions. Mojang notes that playing test versions can corrupt a player's world, so those interested in testing out the feature should backup their world or run them in a different save folder from their main world.</p><p dir="ltr">While Mojang continues to deliver new features to Minecraft, A Minecraft Movie is breaking records at the box office, recently becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-movie-is-now-the-no-2-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-of-all-time/1100-6530830/" data-ref-id="1100-6530830">second-highest-grossing video game film of all time</a> after The Super Mario Bros.

We’re going to talk about the distribution, monetization, and the production of web games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this first post, I want to discuss HTML5 games and where to sell them. This is our first take on this complex problem, and if you find this useful, keep up to date with the rest of the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So you have a game, ideally several, and all of them are hosted on one platform. Maybe a couple of platforms.

It is, frankly, a dream.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monetization—we are getting revenue right here, right now.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Easy—we can create a hyper-casual game in under a month and start earning immediately.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Web—everyone using the platform can start playing in no time on any device.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No region restrictions—no questions here.

Well, there’s always some challenges to that, here are just some:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The long tail is not long.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s no way to go but down. We’ve learned this the hard way. Most dev graphs (which they will be very reluctant to show you) will mostly look like this.

The growth of requirements and restrictions is mostly caused by the growth of competition. There are more and more games being uploaded to the platform every day, and our games are just getting squeezed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You could say, “Well, I’m just going to build a new game, and I will keep building these new games, catching waves and capitalizing on them.” However, building a new game requires time and money. Even if you work alone, it’s still going to take time to do and there’s no guarantee your idea is going to work.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-is-laying-off-68-employees-after-selling-its-game-business-for-3-5-billion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Niantic is laying off 68 employees after selling its game business for $3.5 billion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fourth reason is that you don’t know what’s going to happen. You just don’t. Instead of placing all your eggs in one basket and hoping for the best, why not try to diversify, and help yourself make more money in new places.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s sum up. You have a number of games, they are localized in English, and can work on the web. You know they are profitable, you know there’s enough retention and ad views, and you know people like them. So here comes the next question - What can you publish?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can we publish?">Where can we publish?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m not going to waste air persuading you to build games for the web. However, I do want to give you some numbers to use as you see fit to figure out what to publish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time to develop: 1-3 months. Including testing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cost: under $10 000.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Competition: Monkey Mart (300M plays), Level Devil (83M plays), Stickman Hook (574M plays), Subway Surfers (1B plays).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last row of numbers were taken from the presentation done by Poki rep to the Defold community. Yes, Subway Surfers is there, but the other games on the list are much smaller. They do have good quality though, so remember, when you go big - try to keep up.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can we publish?">Where can we publish?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think of the web game distribution market as an inverted pyramid.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-has-raised-the-price-of-the-playstation-5-in-some-markets" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony has raised the price of the PlayStation 5 in some markets</a></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s the top tier that includes platforms like Poki and Crazy Games. Poki has about 30 million monthly active users (MAU) - this is the metric that is traditionally used to calculate the general audience of the platform. 700 billion gameplays/month on Poki. Crazy Games has similar numbers 30 MAU and 300 million games played monthly.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The middle layer is all kinds of other platforms. This includes the likes of Y8, Kongregate, and Newgrounds.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And then there are these aggregators, like GameMonetize, GamePix, Game Distribution. GameDistribution for example has over 2000 web publishers on their platform.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. This inverted pyramid is what the platforms want you to think of the web game market, so you don’t move from that platform. The reality is that under that peak there’s a whole other space for web games that has remained invisible for years.</span></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, let me take one moment to break it down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First we have websites. Look at the graph from Statista below. In the year 2021, there were 1.88 billion website launches. All of these websites launch and die, with a large number of them growing, maturing, and slowly decreasing their influence. This last part of their journey is something that we are most interested in!</span></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When businesses understand that their website lifespan is close to its end, they need to find ways to revitalize their user base. Another reason to push them towards games— they need to find new ways to show ads. Games often become a perfect medium for this, attracting users and increasing the return on ad spend (ROAS). This is increasingly becoming part of the strategy for not only smaller websites, but also larger media platforms like The New York Times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social media platforms, chat platforms, streaming platforms—all of these spaces are embracing games! Discord has games, Viber has games, even Linkedin has games. This is possible thanks to the HTML5, and the way this content could be easily integrated into any online service. Even places like Wikipedia could potentially find a place for games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Note about Mobile Stores">Note about Mobile Stores</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apart from these general platforms, there are also web-app stores, like Chrome Web Store, where you can potentially distribute games yourself. For this, you can use packaging tools like Electron. You can also go to mobile stores like App Store and Google Play. Currently there are 250,068 mobile games on Google Play, with the top grossing backed by large publishers with deep pockets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s the math for you. If you publish on mobile, you need to invest at least 25% of the budget into marketing, plus pay a 15-30% service fee for each dollar of revenue. If you choose to sign up with a publisher, be ready for the 30/70 split, where 70% goes to the publisher’s pocket. For many developers this kind of spending is completely impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With this in mind, the underlying opportunity seems to be humongous. With billions of websites all over the world and easy seamless integration, why do we keep limiting ourselves to chosen platforms, and not diversifying our distribution?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that out of the way. How do you get to that sweet new audience on the web?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges of Self-Publishing">Challenges of Self-Publishing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper it should be easy. You go to Poki and Crazy Games, they approve your game, and you reap the benefits. However, practitioners will know that almost immediately they will be hit with a refusal, or they will just ignore you and never get back. This happens mostly because of quality issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moderation on these platforms is usually being done on two levels: technical compatibility and IP compatibility.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technical requirements are usually fairly rigorous, and require important features like a save system, player progression, ad monetization (banner, interstitial, rewarded), in-game purchases, social features (share, invite a friend, add to favorites, etc.), leaderboards, language and device information, and remote configuration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IP compatibility is an overview of all the content you have in the game. The platform needs to make sure that there is no content that violates IP rights from their legitimate owners. This can be quite restrictive, especially for titles with no original content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is worth noting that even if you go through the moderation process on one platform, you will still have to do it for the competitors: big and small. The further you go, the lower the requirements become, but the higher the risk that the project will not be making any money.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Don’t miss out on the opportunity">Don’t miss out on the opportunity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No matter how you are going to address these challenges, I would encourage you to do it. The main reason being the longer you wait, the more opportunities you are going to miss. The way the web games are progressing today, they have the potential to become gateways to new markets and amazing new adventures for the industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How to do it—that’s another question. I see three options so far:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can do it yourself. Get a separate employee, or be that employee, who’s going to attack each and every platform, look at each and every store and aggregator, and try to get there yourself. It’s time-consuming, but you’ll learn a lot.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publisher. Publishers are expensive, you will lose on a lot of money, but if they do pick you up, you will know for sure your game is worth it and you will be making money. But note that the publisher will probably take over 70% of it.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game distribution and monetization platforms. To operate in such a vast and fragmented market, new and efficient tools are essential. At Playgama.com, we're bringing to life this kind of vision—a unified platform that connects the entire web and serves as a gateway to the widest possible network of distributors and platforms worldwide (we talk thousands), both gaming and non-gaming. I believe this is the future, and it’s coming very soon.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We enter a new stage in the way entertainment is consumed. This new stage will disrupt not only the way we access games, but also ways we monetize and distribute them. We are at the brink of the huge explosion of opportunity for game developers and publishers.

Funcom, developers of the MMORPG based on Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> sci-fi series, <a href="https://pr.funcom.com/An-important-update-regarding-Dune-Awakening">announced the news</a> saying the game will be pushed back from its May release date to June 10th. Players who have pre-purchased one of the game’s deluxe editions will get access a few days earlier on June 5th.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> takes place in an alternate universe where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review">Timothee Chalamet was never born</a> and thus never fought Austin Butler in single combat. Your job, as a new arrival to the desert planet Arrakis, is to investigate the disappearance of the Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants. To do that you’ll have to combat exhaustion, thirst, the blood thirsty Harkonnens, and the Shai Hulud, Arrakis’ big bad worm dudes.</p><p>The delay of the game is only a few weeks, which according to Funcom, gives developers “more time to cook.” Funcom wrote in its announcement that it intends to use the additional time to respond to feedback from the game’s ongoing closed beta testing.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/runescape-returns-as-an-open-world-survival-rpg-in-which-you-hunt-a-dragon-queen">just a couple of weeks ago</a>, and today developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/jagex">Jagex</a> hosted a livestream where they showed a deep-dive of the game and revealed the game's release date. Turns out, it's today! As in right now, today, as in you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">go to Steam to buy the game in early access</a> if that's something you'd be interested in.

This'll be quite a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> experience than you might be used to, though, as this spin-off from the long-running MMO is one of those open world, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, survival crafting kind of games. The Steam page makes it clear that the game is still "RuneScape at its core", as you'll have quests to venture out on, magic to use to craft homes and fight enemies, and there's even some "light RPG elements" too.

It's still a multiplayer experience too, as up to four of you can play together as you set out to slay the Dragon Queen. Oh, yeah, dragons aren't your friends unfortunately, you have to kill them, which I suppose is the traditional thing to do to the scaly creatures. Overall, it looks something akin to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>, albeit with that general RuneScapey vibe.
</p>
<p>
In a press release Jagex said they're planning regular updates for the game, with a big focus on "listening closely to the community" - hence the early access release, I suppose. I'm not entirely convinced by how the game looks just yet, I think it'll need a bit more of a hook than multiplayer survival crafting game, but it's RuneScape. The genre's just a bit too saturated these days. I like the sound of there being quests rather than just self-directed play as many games of its ilk tend to be, fingers crossed Jagex leans into that a bit to help Dragonwilds stand out.

Even with a group of simulated players helping you clear more challenging content, the EXP comes in drips, not streams.

I’d typically avoid a decrease to damage, but the improved attack speed is worth it. </li><li>With the <strong>Viper’s Sting</strong> major Perk, hitting two consecutive scoped shots on a target will deal an extra 25 damage and reload two ammo. Keep your aim true and you’ll just keep getting your ammo back.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25733"><a id="bastion"></a>Bastion</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The biggest drawback to Bastion’s ultimate is that he’s left to be a sitting duck during it. <strong>Armored Artillery</strong> provides some flexibility by giving 300 temporary overhealth.</li><li><strong>Self-Repair</strong> brings back the identically-named ability from the original Overwatch, only now without a resource meter.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25734"><a id="cassidy"></a>Cassidy</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Quick Draw</strong> changes Cassidy’s Fan the Hammer ability from an automatic technique to a manually controlled one that can now land critical hits. This is the preferred Perk simply for being less situational than the other choice.</li><li>The <strong>Gun Slingin’</strong> major Perk reduces Combat Roll’s cooldown by three seconds for every critical hit you land with your primary fire. Reducing the cooldown by a minimum of half is a fantastic reward for landing a headshot.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25735"><a id="echo"></a>Echo</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Both of Echo’s minor Perks buff her ultimate, but <strong>Enhanced Duplication</strong> takes the cake by extending Duplicate’s duration by three seconds for the first clone ultimate you use.</li><li><strong>Full Salvo</strong> upgrades Sticky Bombs with 50-percent more projectiles at the cost of 15-percent less damage. It’s an overall damage increase and is arguably more useful than the other Perk.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25736"><a id="genji"></a>Genji</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon’s Thirst</strong> adds a 30-percent lifesteal ability to Genji’s ultimate, which greatly boosts your chances of survival.</li><li><strong>Meditation</strong> is another Perk that increases Genji’s sustainability. It regenerates 25 health per second while using Deflect.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25737"><a id="hanzo"></a>Hanzo</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Scatter Arrows</strong> enhances Hanzo’s Storm Arrows so that when they ricochet, they split into three new projectiles with two extra bounces each. This melds his original Scatter Arrow ability with Storm Arrows, and it’s awesome.</li><li>With <strong>Dragon Fury</strong>, hitting an enemy with your primary fire will increase your attack speed by 25-percent for one second. Keep getting hits and you can keep shooting fast.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25738"><a id="junkrat"></a>Junkrat</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Nitro Boost</strong> adds an optional boost ability for Junkrat’s RIP-Tire ultimate, albeit at the cost of 50-percent damage when used. Aside from reaching enemies faster, it’s much more useful than his other minor Perk.</li><li><strong>Frag Cannon</strong> is another handy Perk centered around speed, increasing Frag Launcher’s attack speed by 40-percent in exchange for one less ammo. Mid-range and closer fights are much easier when you don’t need to lead enemies as much.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25739"><a id="mei"></a>Mei</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Chilling Reach</strong> increases Mei’s primary fire range by 30-percent, but more importantly, it has more impact than the Permafrost Perk.</li><li>Nothing is worse than being surrounded while using the Cryo-Freeze ability. With the <strong>Cryo-Storm</strong> Perk, nearby enemies will be slowed and take a whopping 70 damage per second. Adding an offensive element to a healing ability that leaves you invulnerable is a must-pick.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25740"><a id="pharah"></a>Pharah</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Nothing encapsulates my time playing Pharah more than getting killed midway through her ultimate. <strong>Drift Thrusters</strong> immensely improve her ultimate with the simple addition of being able to move.</li><li><strong>Fuel Stores</strong> modifies Jet Dash to grant 50-percent fuel and increase maximum overfuel by 100-percent. This provides another handy choice for keeping your fuel reserves up.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25741"><a id="reaper"></a>Reaper</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Soul Reaving</strong> is another powerful Perk that brings back an older character mechanic. More specifically, eliminated enemies drop Soul Globes that restore 50 health.</li><li><strong>Dire Triggers</strong> gives Reaper a long-range option for his shotguns, letting you contribute from a distance or finish off any fleeing enemies.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25742"><a id="sojourn"></a>Sojourn</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sojourn’s ammo cap adds 15 more bullets with the <strong>Extended Mag</strong> Perk. Having a full second more of shooting is great for your damage.</li><li>Dissruptor Shot can inflict 320 total damage if an enemy stays within its area-of-effect (AoE). <strong>Adhesive Siphon</strong> practically guarantees that damage by letting it stick to enemies and generating Railgun energy too.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25743"><a id="76"></a>Soldier: 76</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Field Emergency</strong> is perfect for intense moments as it doubles Biotic Field’s healing for critical health allies. Yes, that includes yourself as well.</li><li><strong>Agility Training</strong> is the ideal Perk if repositioning and diving into firefights is your game. It increases Sprint’s speed by 20-percent and also lets you reload while sprinting.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25744"><a id="sombra"></a>Sombra</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Translocator is often used when your health is low during a dicey fight. <strong>CTRL ALT ESC</strong> is ideal for those moments, initiating health regeneration when teleporting at critical health.</li><li><strong>White Hat</strong> lets you hack allies to restore 100 health over two seconds. This is a great use of Hack during non-combative moments or if you notice someone in dire need of healing.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25745"><a id="symmetra"></a>Symmetra</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Sentry Capacity</strong> gives Symmetra an extra Sentry Turret to place. It’s not as bad as the six-sentry “car wash” from many years ago, but the enemy team certainly won’t be happy. </li><li><strong>Perfect Alignment</strong> increases the primary fire range by 15-percent with each charge level, making it easy to finish off fleeing targets.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25746"><a id="torbjorn"></a>Torbjorn</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Fully Loaded</strong> maxes out your ammo upon activating Overload, so you’re always ready to dish out damage. This has much more consistent use than the other Perk.</li><li><strong>Anchor Bolts</strong> lets you deploy your turret 50-percent farther and, more importantly, attach it to walls and ceilings. The creative opportunities alone make this the better choice.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25747"><a id="tracer"></a>Tracer</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Zipping around the map for healing can be a common Tracer occurrence. With <strong>Blink Packs</strong>, you’ll gain a Blink charge from health packs for your troubles.</li><li>Keeping up with the Blink-related Perks to help you stay alive and elusive, the <strong>Flashback</strong> Perk upgrades Recall to restore all three Blink charges.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25748"><a id="venture"></a>Venture</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Excavation Exhilaration</strong> makes it so that your ability cooldowns are three times quicker while using Venture’s ultimate.</li><li><strong>SMART-R Excavator</strong> buffs the range of Venture’s primary fire by 25-percent, allowing for longer shots to be made.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h25749"><a id="widowmaker"></a>Widowmaker</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>With the <strong>Scoped Efficiency</strong> Perk, a scoped shot only costs three ammo instead of five. Needing to reload less is a major help.</li><li><strong>Deadly Deux</strong> increases Venom Mine damage by 50-percent and lets you throw out two of them. An enemy triggering both at once would take the same amount of damage, but this lets you cover multiple exits and be generally more aggressive with the mines.</li></ul><hr><p>While these are the most consistently helpful choices, the alternatives are plenty viable for the right situations. Try being familiar with all of them so you’re ready to adapt for the team.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other retailers indicate a date of April 30. Meanwhile, it seems controllers and other accessories will be available to pre-order on April 30 across the board. </p><p>My assumption is that the April 21 date is old and no longer the plan. The fact that hardware will reportedly be available to pre-order on the 30th and that some retailers are supposedly going to offer console pre-orders on that same day seems to point to April 30, about two weeks from now, being the day when people in the U.S. will be able to start pre-ordering the Switch 2 console and controllers. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if these dates are real. I assume Nintendo will be sharing official details later this week if we really are getting pre-orders on April 23 in Canada.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
