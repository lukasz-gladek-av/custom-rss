			<p>Today, Microsoft announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-pc-available-through-xbox-app-insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> (available as part of Game Pass Ultimate) has received initial mouse and keyboard support for the following twenty-six games:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ARK Survival Evolved</em></li>
<li><em>Atomic Heart</em></li>
<li><em>Cities: Skylines – Mayor’s Edition</em></li>
<li><em>Cities: Skylines – Remastered</em></li>
<li><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></li>
<li><em>Doom 64</em></li>
<li><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>(browser only)</li>
<li><em>Gears Tactics</em></li>
<li><em>Grounded</em></li>
<li><em>Halo Infinite</em></li>
<li><em>High on Life</em></li>
<li><em>House Flipper</em></li>
<li><em>Inkulinati&nbsp;</em>(Game Preview)</li>
<li><em>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em></li>
<li><em>Norco</em></li>
<li><em>Pentiment</em></li>
<li><em>Quake</em></li>

</ul>
<p>Mouse and keyboard support will be available through browsers like Edge and Chrome once players follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/15/xbox-may-update-2024/xbox.com/play">xbox.com/play</a>.</li>
<li>Sign in with your Microsoft account.</li>
<li>Select a mouse and keyboard-supported game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later in May, users will also be able to use the Xbox app on PC by selecting a game with a mouse and keyboard badge. From there, they can use their mouse and keyboard to control the game, just like on any PC game. It is even possible to switch between using a mouse and keyboard combination and a controller at any time by simply pressing a key on the keyboard or the Xbox button on the controller.</p>
<p>The Xbox app on PC also received an update. To start with, there's a new channel dedicated to the upcoming game Senua's Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory. Moreover, Microsoft began rolling out some new Compact Mode features, including Jump back in and Friends, with a subset of players and with all Xbox Insiders.</p>

  <p id="fo6HWB"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova"><em>X-Men ’97</em></a> closed out its first season in the glorious, traditional way of its forebear, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24106782/x-men-animated-series-97-92-censors-broadcast-standards-practices"><em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em></a>. That is to say, with a wild cliffhanger. </p>
<p id="lxEKme">But unlike the last season of <em>The Animated Series</em>, which saw Professor Xavier leaving Earth to (presumably) die of wounds sustained in battle with anti-mutant forces, <em>X-Men ’97</em> won’t take 27 years to follow up. </p>
<h2 id="ToBzcR"><strong>Is X-Men ’97 getting a second season? </strong></h2>
<p id="SFRizA">Yes! <em>X-Men ’97</em>’s second season was greenlit in back in 2022, and production on it is already largely wrapped, with Marvel Animation spinning up production on a third season as well. </p>
<p id="vCWkdI">It’s a good time to be a fan of the X-Men in animation! </p>

<p id="fOHkYD">In a word: Apocalypse. The final episode of season 1 left the X-Men separated across three different time periods following the destruction of Magneto’s floating base, Asteroid M. This doesn’t seem to have been intentional on their part — the time-stranded X-Men seem flummoxed by it, and as Bishop describes it, “something or someone yanked our friends through time.” Being a time traveler himself, Bishop would know. </p>
<p id="cAtyv3">So the second season of <em>X-Men ’97</em> looks to be separating itself into three plot lines — at least to start with — set in Egypt’s ancient past, Earth’s far future, and the present day. And if we bring in some X-Men comics knowledge, it’s clear that all of these plots arc back to the villain Apocalypse. </p>

<p id="ODscZ4">Rogue, Nightcrawler, Beast, Professor X, and Magento seem to be stranded in the ancient past, just in time to interact with the origin story of Apocalypse. The big, blue-faced X-Men villain who believes mutantkind must be put through rigorous “survival of the fittest”-based challenges in order to claim their dominance over humans began his immortal existence as an ancient Egyptian man. </p>

<p id="V5dOXI">Cyclops and Jean are stranded 2,000 years in the future, in the time of Clan Askani, a group of rebel fighters resisting the (<em>ahem</em>) post-apocalyptic rule of Apocalypse. In the comics, the Askani’s timeline is where baby Cable was sent, in the hopes that the future might hold the cure to his techno-organic virus, and Cable was received there as a kind of messianic child — his time-travel confirmed destiny being to put an end to Apocalypse’s reign. </p>
<p id="5W5NUG"><em>Also</em>, in the comics, Mother Askani (who is actually Scott and Jean’s grown-up daughter from yet another timeline, but don’t worry about it) used her own mutant gift of time manipulation to pull Cyclops and Jean into the future so that they could actually raise their own son there, before returning to the present day as if no time had passed. Cable’s presence here — as the teenage Nathan — indicates that <em>X-Men ’97</em> will be taking its own swing at that story, called <em>The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix</em>. </p>

<p id="AV6Bnw">Season 1’s finale credits scene brings us back to Apocalypse in the present, and gives us a big hint at the future of all those really juicy, loved, or love-to-hate X-Men characters — like Gambit, Emma Frost, and Sebastian Shaw — who died on Genosha. </p>
<p id="Ojmfng">“So much pain, my children,” Apocalypse orates over one of Gambit’s playing cards. “So much <em>death</em>.” The odds of Apocalypse striking back at humanity for the fall of Genosha seem likely, and that he’ll resurrect some of Genosha’s dead as his Four Horsemen seems inevitable. </p>
<p id="b8dCGl">So as the X-Men search for their friends from the present, its seems they’ll have to contest with Apocalypse’s plans as well. </p>

Before beginning production on season 3, however, Marvel Animation will be searching for a new showrunner, after the studio “<a href="https://ew.com/x-men-97-beau-demayo-firing-marvel-animation-responds-8609643">parted ways</a>” with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/marvel-shocker-x-men-97-creator-beau-demayo-fired-1235850423/">writer Beau DeMayo</a>.</p>

Simply download the .exe, tell it where the ROM is located on your PC, hit play, and boom, you have a native PC port of<em> Majora’s Mask</em>, complete with an easy-to-use in-game menu that lets you change many settings on the fly.

Even better, these recompiled ports can be improved with ray-tracing and other visual enhancements, too. </p><p>In theory (with a few exceptions), almost every N64 game can be recompiled using this tool and made playable on PC with a few tweaks. And most users won’t ever have to use the tool, as they’ll just download a small program that was pre-made by a modder, add their ROM, and that’s it. But if you have a bit of computer knowledge, you could port any of your favorite N64 games to  PC in a matter of minutes.</p><p>This new tool won’t make decompiled ports, like the <em>Mario 6</em>4 PC port we saw a few years ago, worthless as those more advanced ports will offer more modding options and ways to tweak the game directly. However, for most people, a recompiled N64 port will get the job done and let them quickly and easily replay practically any classic game from that era on their PC. What a world we live in. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been confirmed by Ubisoft that the map of Japan for Assassin’s Creed Shadows is ‘around the same size’ as the Egyptian map featured in 2017’s Assassin’s Creed Origins. The latter title was the first ‘super-sized’ Assassin’s Creed game, bringing about a change in the formula that stripped away what previously existed and replaced it with an open-world RPG style of gameplay.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with IGN, it was claimed that AC Shadows won’t be as large as Valhalla or Odyssey, but it’s on par with Assassin’s Creed Origins.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-still-huge">That’s Still Huge</h2>



<p>Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage was praised globally because of it being a ‘return to form’ for the franchise, boasting a smaller, denser map that was a wonder to explore. It meant that users could tackle everything the game offered without worrying about pouring hundreds of hours into it – and even I, with my very limited time, managed to 100% the game.</p>



<p>It seems like Ubisoft is pivoting entirely on that short-form concept and returning instantly to the broader, more epic maps that we’ve come to know and (partially) love from the Assassin’s Creed series of late.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-set-assassins-creed-shadows-is-around-the-same-size-as-assassins-creed-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with IGN</a>,  Ubisoft’s creative director, Jonathan Dumont, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s in-line with the latest Assassin’s Creeds that we’ve done. On a scale level, maybe we can compare it a little bit more to the size of Assassin’s Creed Origins. We did want to have a much closer to real life scale ratio. So because castles took a lot of space, and we really wanted the mountains to feel like mountains, we’ve made the environments feel wider in the game. But I would say around the same size as Origins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Origins still feels massive to this day, incorporating the entirety of Egypt from border to border. It’s a staggering map but a beautiful one, and it wasn’t as ‘packed’ with things to do as Valhalla was, for example. That helped it feel less daunting. In 2020, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was released, becoming the most ambitious AC game ever made. If you want to complete everything this gargantuan game has to offer, you’ll be playing for a good two hundred hours or more. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes players to Feudal Japan and allows them to take control of a Shinobi and a Samurai. It’s an operating model that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-will-work-like-ac-syndicate/">was seen in 2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</a>, and in the first trailer that was released recently by Ubisoft, it looks like a killer dynamic that’ll make for an interesting gameplay loop.</p>



<p>Are you bored of big-map Assassin’s Creed games?</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows, led and developed by Ubisoft Quebec, has had an impressive 15 other studios developing it over the years.</p>



<p>As spotted at the bottom of the official Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, it displays all of the developers who worked on the game. Ubisoft Quebec is the main developer, but support studios include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ubisoft Belgrade</li>



<li>Ubisoft Bordeaux</li>



<li>Ubisoft Bucharest</li>



<li>Ubisoft Chengdu</li>



<li>Ubisoft Kyiv</li>



<li>Ubisoft Manila</li>



<li>Ubisoft Montpellier</li>



<li>Ubisoft Montreal</li>



<li>Ubisoft Odesa</li>



<li>Ubisoft Osaka</li>



<li>Ubisoft Pune</li>



<li>Ubisoft Shanghai</li>



<li>Ubisoft Singapore</li>



<li>Ubisoft Sofia</li>



<li>Ubisoft Tokyo</li>
</ul>



<div><p>While it’s unclear on why Assassin’s Creed Shadows needed so many different support studios, it’s likely because of the “Anvil Pipeline” engine, which will unify the Assassin’s Creed series as a whole. So perhaps some studios working on Hexe, or one of the many other Assassin’s Creed titles in development, offered a helping hand in Shadows.</p><p>Although the news might not be interesting to some, the number of 16 total studios is one of the largest numbers for a Ubisoft title I’ve personally seen. For context, Skull and Bones, another Ubisoft title, had 11 different studios working on its development, which lasted nearly a decade.</p></div>

It was confirmed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will only be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, effectively making Assassin’s Creed Mirage the last AC title to be released on the last generation of home consoles.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-rockstar-studio-open-world-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dan-houser%E2%80%99s-studio-is-making-a-third-person-open-world-game.871965/</guid>

<p>Last year, Dan Houser’s studio – Absurd Ventures – was revealed to be working on a slew of multimedia projects that included an audio drama and a graphic novel. Houser, who was one of the founders of Rockstar Games, parted ways with the Grand Theft Auto creator in 2020, announcing his new endeavour shortly after.</p>



<p>Now, in a job listing, it has been suggested that Absurd Ventures is working on a third-person, open-world action-adventure game.</p>



<p>Does that ring any bells?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stealy-wheelie-automobiley">Stealy Wheelie Automobiley</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers#4366082007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a job listing</a> dug up on the Absurd Ventures website, it’s revealed that the firm is working on an open-world action-adventure game. That’s the basic description for Grand Theft Auto, which might suggest that Dan Houser is attempting to compete with his former company in at least some way. Here’s an extract from the listing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Become the primary vision holder and hands-on contributor for character, controls, and camera design in an open world action-adventure game. The person in this role will lead a team of multi-disciplinary specialists to deliver best-in-class combat and third person action across multiple game modes.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The listing goes on to request that the suitable applicant should have experience in combat design for an action game, as well as experience developing both melee and shooting action mechanics. Houser isn’t alone as a former Rockstar developer at Absurd Ventures – he was recently joined by the infamous Lazlow Jones, who many will recognise from the in-game radio stations, on which he spent many years voicing a character of the same name.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that Absurd Ventures is working on something that would ever rival Grand Theft Auto, but it might be another solid entry into the genre that has fluctuated a little of late. It was recently revealed that Saints Row (2022) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/">only sold 1.7 million copies</a> before Volition was shut down.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Division Heartland: Developer Deep Dive Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said Heartland was "not aligned" with Ubisoft's business plans. Ubisoft management said on an earnings call that the company made a "significant" investment into Heartland, but declined to specify the game's actual budget.</p><p>The game's cancellation came as a surprise to some, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-heartland-might-be-releasing-very-soon/1100-6519524/" data-ref-id="1100-6519524">some signs pointed to the game being nearly ready for release.</a> Ubisoft allowed members of the public to play Heartland as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-heartland-gets-extended-gameplay-showcase-survival-features-detailed/1100-6513454/" data-ref-id="1100-6513454">testing phase</a>. There was plenty of gameplay footage and information available, and in the trailer above, Heartland appeared to be far along in development (though the reality of the situation is unknown). </p><p>Although Heartland has been canceled, Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-officially-in-the-works-announced-with-little-fanfare/1100-6517899/" data-ref-id="1100-6517899">moving ahead with The Division 3.</a> It's been some time since we've heard about the game, but it could show up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-year-later-ubisoft-forward-is-back-for-another-june-showcase/1100-6522364/" data-ref-id="1100-6522364">during Ubisoft Forward in June</a>. Ubisoft is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-resurgence-lets-agents-take-the-fight-mobile/1100-6505374/" data-ref-id="1100-6505374">The Division Resurgence</a>, a mobile game that is slated for release later this year.</p><p>In other Ubisoft news, the company just officially revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and revealed it's coming this November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/15/the-division-heartland-has-been-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/05/06/ubisoft-reveals-free-tom-clancys-the-division-game-with-heartland">First announced in 2021</a>, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.</p>

<p>Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf">earnings report</a>, stating,</p>

<p>“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpgpc0pGLFE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/21/ubisoft-announces-tom-clancys-the-division-3-appoints-new-series-producer">The Division 3</a> last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/19/ubisoft-confirms-team-based-arena-combat-game-project-q-has-been-canceled">Project Q</a> and<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/11/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-skull-and-bones-delayed-again"> three other games in development</a>. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/21/ubisoft-cancels-ghost-recon-frontline-splinter-cell-vr-two-unannounced-games">were also axed</a>. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-fenyx-rising-2-reportedly-canceled-ubisoft"> reportedly scrapped</a> last July.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="122" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Raven Software stepped in and nerfed the Riveter and Tonfa, after both weapons unexpectedly performed above expectations. </p> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">It’s been a busy week for the <em>Warzone</em> devs. On May 14, a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-may-14-update-patch-notes-cor-45-exploit-fix-dg-58-lsw-nerf-reload-bug-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minor update</a> implemented measure to prevent players from firing the COR-45 IP-V2 conversion kit faster than intended. Previously<em> Warzone</em> players discovered questionable workarounds that made the pistol have the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-setting-on-pc-makes-cor-45-fastest-killing-weapon-in-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest time-to-kill speed</a> in Warzone for short-range meta weapons. The patch also finally fixed the reload issues caused by the automatic tactical sprint and prioritize interact settings that had been plaguing the battle royale for weeks. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true">The devs didn’t stop there. In a second update in as many days, they dropped the hammer on two weapons, which were quietly starting to take over<em> Warzone </em>lobbies. According to a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tonfas-have-strong-potential-to-take-over-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> from a frustrated player, the Tonfa melee weapon killed faster than any other weapon within a three-meter range. The melee weapon also allegedly gained notoriety because players would hide in smoke grenades and kill enemies without ever knowing what happened because the Combat Scout perk revealed their location. </p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Meanwhile, the Riveter’s destructive power flew under radars, but the shotgun could shred through enemies in close-range engagements. Despite not gaining much traction on social media or in popularity rankings, Raven Software had its finger on the pulse and responded accordingly. </p> <h2 id="h-warzone-may-15-update-patch-notes" data-injectable="false"><em>Warzone</em> May 15 update patch notes</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Weapon adjustments </h3> <h4 data-injectable="false">Riveter </h4> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>.410 Gauge Ball Ammunition</strong> <ul> <li>Near-Mid Damage decreased to 30, down from 33.</li> <li>Mid Damage decreased to 25, down from 27.</li> <li>*New Damage Range Added* <ul> <li>Far-Mid Damage set to 21.&nbsp;</li> <li>Far-Mid Damage range set to 16.51 meters.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Min Damage decreased to 15, down from 25.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Future Cat Games, the developer behind 2016 puzzle-adventure <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/oneshot-game-coming-to-consoles-in-2022-ps4-switch-pc-xbox-one-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>OneShot</em></a>, has officially <a href="https://twitter.com/MarginStrange/status/1790502851149722021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> its new project. Next up is <em>Margin of the Strange</em>, which is set to make its full trailer debut along with a Kickstarter campaign on May 21.</p> <p data-characters="90" data-current-count="90" data-injectable="false">Ahead of that full trailer reveal, Future Cat Games shared a fittingly enigmatic teaser:&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Margin of the Strange - Kickstarter coming May 21st" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J98fBInCuaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true">Steam wishlisting has yet to go live at the time of this writing, but we at least know a little about the story and style thanks to the <a href="https://marginofthestrange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>. <em>Margin of the Strange </em>follows a young man named Ling who is, for all intents and purposes, a first-time dreamer. As he ventures into this dreamworld, he discovers a unique alien ecosystem with its own physical laws. It’s here that he must explore the mysteries within and, over the next six weeks, learn more about his life and death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Future Cat bills <em>Margin of the Strange </em>as a “gardening-themed mystery exploration game,” which sounds about right given that brief story description. Ling is a moth-like character, and as such one of the things you can do in the game is “stare at lamps and drink sugar water (moth things).” You can also make friends to gather further information and grow plants to “reverse local entropy.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Future Cat Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="823" data-injectable="false">Developed in GameMaker, <em>Margin of the Strange </em>currently has no release date in place. According to the site’s history section, it all started as NightMargin’s personal project that was first conceived over 10 years ago. This version of the game has been in the works since 2021, and will be able to enter full-time development if the crowdfunding is successful. We should learn more once the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/futurecatgames/margin-of-the-strange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a> goes live, so keep an eye on the page if you want to further explore this particular moth garden mystery.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;is getting close to the release of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;expansion, and Bungie has been tantalizing fans with glimpses at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=destructoid+prismatic&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">the Prismatic Subclass</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Dread forces</a> featured. Now, the studio has revealed what new Exotic armor each Class can&nbsp;get their hands on.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Exotic armor is the lifeblood of builds in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. While usually bolstering fantastic effects on their own, Exotics armor often synergizes with armor mods, Subclass Aspects or Fragments, and Exotic weapons, taking a playstyle to another level. While Exotics can come into the game during Seasons or through the new Episode format, Bungie typically releases one for each Class at the dawn of a new expansion.</p>
 <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false">Bungie took to X,&nbsp;formerly Twitter, to share three new Exotic chest pieces for&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, with an accompanying video demonstrating how each would work.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Warlock – Mataidoxia</h2> <figure data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">The Mataidoxia Exotic chest piece is Strand-centric. The Exotic buffs the Subclass’ Empowered Melee ability, Arcane Needle, causing a large Suspending elemental explosion.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">It appears that players&nbsp;need to expend all three charges of Arcane Needle for the Exotic effect to trigger, making it slightly less appealing, but the wide effect range makes for easy clean-up with a Needlestorm Super, as the clip shows.&nbsp;That said, with rotating abilities for the Prismatic Subclass, using all three melee charges may not matter.</p>
 <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">The Warlock Exotic is a predominantly white robe with a mass of intertwining fibers on its chest. It also sports some snazzy buttons going down the sides.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Titan – Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <figure data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We heard you like rockets… </p><p>Fire a bevy of rockets at those foolish enough to stand against you when using your Titan class ability, thanks to the new Hazardous Propulsion chest exotic. Available with The Final Shape.</p><p>🔺 <a href="https://t.co/j3dtI8NvzK">https://t.co/j3dtI8NvzK</a> <a href="https://t.co/5adMzrgObx">pic.twitter.com/5adMzrgObx</a></p></div>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1790426929335529914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Titans get the Hazardous Propulsion Exotic chest, which&nbsp;sounds like it&nbsp;can work well with any Subclass.&nbsp;The Exotic creates a barrage of homing Exodus rockets whenever players use their Class ability.</p> <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">The short clip shows a Titan using the Hazardous Propulsion effect with two different Class abilities: one where the player uses Arc’s Thruster Class ability and another showcasing the ever-popular Rally Barricade.</p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">The Titan Exotic might have the coolest drip&nbsp;of all, with Hazardous Propulsion working in an OG&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;character. While the Exotic looks cool on its own with its bulgy space armor design (complete with vents and wiring), Titans will be carrying Failsafe on their chest. Failsafe, of course, is the AI personality of the Exodus Black colony ship and the Destination vendor on Nessus.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hunter-gifted-conviction" data-injectable="false">Hunter – Gifted Conviction</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">The Gifted Conviction Exotic chest piece is an Arc choice for Hunters. This Exotic allows Hunters to create three powerful bouncing Arc projectiles that fan out as they travel.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">It looks like Gifted Conviction’s effect&nbsp;is activated&nbsp;after performing a Powered Melee, as the clip shows a Hunter activating it after both an Amplified slide and an Arc Staff uppercut. The projectiles also appear to apply Jolt to targets.</p> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="false">The Exotic is primarily grey, with a few splotches of blue on one shoulder and on the front. The chest has a decorative embossment with some Arc baubles surrounding it, and the arms have fun pull-strings.</p>

Ubisoft has revealed a first proper look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and detailed the game's dual protagonists. Both characters appear front and centre in the game's new cinematic trailer (gameplay will follow next month, Ubisoft says) and on the game's cover, with each offering a markedly different play style. 
</p>
<p>
Today's trailer opens on Naoe, a female shinobi, as she crosses paths with Yasuke, the historical figure depicted here as a powerful samurai. Initially, it seems, the two are adversaries - but the pair soon find common ground. By the end of the trailer, Naoe is wearing the Assassin's Creed series' iconic Hidden Blade weapon - and both appear to be at least allied with the Assassins.

<p>
For those catching up, or who've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battling-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks-as-main-character-art-appears-online">avoided</a> the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">leaks</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch on 15th November for PC (via the Ubisoft Store and the Epic Game Store) Mac, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with three days early access for those with Ubisoft+ or who buy a pricier collector's edition. Development is led by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind 2015's Syndicate and 2018's Odyssey, with no less than 15 other Ubisoft studios in support roles, including Japanese teams in Osaka and Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
"With our dual protagonists we have two fantasies: the samurai and the shinobi," game director Charles Benoit said. "We want the player to experience both and we can't squeeze both into one character because the samurai and shinobi came from different social classes, so we can't mix them together."
</p>
<p>
"The historical character of Yasuke presented a really exciting oppurtunity for the narrative team," associate narrative director Brooke Davies added. Yasuke arrived in Japan in 1579, which is when the events of Shadows begin.</p>

<p>
"He had relationships with some of the most interesting people in our setting, like [prominent feudal warlord] Oda Nobunaga, the Portuguese and Jesuits," Davies continued, "which made it very tantalising and enticing to come in from a narrative perspective and start weaving these facts with story inbetween." Yasuke's perspective as a foreigner discovering Japan is also useful, as a way to explain the country's rules and customs to players. 
</p>
<p>
Naoe, from the mountainous birthplace of the shinobi, crosses paths with Yasuke when he arrives to destroy her village. Her father is the historical figure Fujibayashi Nagato.
</p>
<p>
The two characters represent two different approaches to the game: the combat-heavy samurai, and the stealth-focused shinobi. And it's the latter character, Naoe, who will be the only one of the two wielding the Assassin's Creed series' iconic hidden blade weapon. 
</p>
<p>
Shadows is set during a period when Japan is in a bloody path to unification, and influenced by foreign forces. The game's open world will feature "spectacular castle towns and bustling ports to peaceful shrines and pastoral landscapes", Ubisoft has said, and will change through the seasons and in different weather. 
 
Exploration will be a key part of the game, Ubisoft continues, with a spies network to unveil new areas and targets, allies to call upon during missions, and a customisable hideout where you can train your squad.
</p>
<p>
There was no detail today on Assassin's Creed Infinity, the content hub that'll launch alongside Shadows and act as a launcher for Assassin's Creed games and a container for the franchise's over-arching metastory. Eurogamer previously talked at length with Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté to find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">what Assassin's Creed Infinity will actually be about</a>.
</p>
<p>And in the meantime, there's also now details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-premium-editions-collectors-edition-plus-season-pass-featuring-exclusive-quest">Assassin's Creed Shadows' inevitable collectors editions</a> to pore over.</p>

Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battling-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks-as-main-character-art-appears-online">flurry of pre-announcement leaks</a>, Ubisoft has shared first official details of its feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed Shadows - including confirmation of its 15th November release date and information on its various "premium" editions, a physical collector's edition, and a season pass giving access to two post-launch expansions and an exclusive quest.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows, a full-scale series entry following last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">smaller-scale Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, was confirmed to be in the works back in September 2022 (albeit under the title Codename Red) and comes from Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind 2018's lovable Assassin's Creed Odyssey. As previously rumoured, it'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">feature two protagonists</a>: a female ninja, Naoe, and Yasuke, a male samurai based on a real historical figure.
</p>
<p>
As part of today's reveal event, Ubisoft has given a first tease of Assassin's Creed Shadows in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8">moody new cinematic story trailer</a>, alongside various other bits of pre-launch information. For starters, there's that season pass, which'll provide access to two post-launch expansions and an exclusive quest line available from launch day - none of which have been detailed so far.

<p>
As is Ubisoft's way, Assassin's Creed Shadows is releasing in a variety of increasingly expensive forms. Alongside the £59.99 base game (£69.99 on consoles), there's a £94.99 Gold Edition adding the season pass and three days "early access", plus a £114.99 Ultimate Edition adding five skill points, the Sekiryu character pack and hideout pack, plus the Red Dragon photo filter. And Ubisoft isn't stopping with the season pass-exclusive quest - there's another one, Thrown to the Dogs, coming with all pre-orders.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Ubisoft has announced a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/7v5jsrR7b9rRQ1Cy29eMf7/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition">physical Collector's Edition</a> which includes everything from the Ultimate Edition, plus a Naoe &amp; Yasuke figurine, a life-sized version of Naoe's Tsuba katana, a wall Creed Scroll, a world-map, an 84-page art book, two sumi-e lithographs, and a steelbook case. There's no price for this extravagant bundle just yet, but don't expect it to be cheap.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic), plus Macs with Apple silicon on 15th November. It'll mark the start of a new era for Ubisoft's franchise, being the first game to ditch the series' divisive modern-day narrative - which will now be told via an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">over-arching hub platform named Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once Assassin's Creed Shadows arrive that'll leave just two of the four previously confirmed new series entry to go: the witchy looking Codename Hexe - set in 16th century Europe - which appears to be targeting a 2026 launch, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-jade-likely-delayed-to-2025-report">mobile-focused Codename Jade</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series, and it's got a release date already as well.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will launch on November 15th and will follow the stories of shinobi Assassin Naoe and African samurai Yasuke, the latter of whom is&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s first real-life protagonist.</p>
<p>The game will take place in the Azuchi-Momoyama era of Japanese history (that's the late 16th to very early 17th century) and will dovetail the stories of the two characters as they "usher in a new era for Japan", according to Ubisoft.</p>

<p>Rather, it sounds like both of their stories will be critical to the narrative, so you'll be playing as both of them in turn, not dissimilarly to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</em>'s playable twins.</p>
<p>You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>right here. It sets up Naoe and Yasuke's stories and gives a hint as to how they'll interact over the course of the story.</p>

<p>Along with the cinematic premiere, Ubisoft has also released a deep dive video into the characters of Naoe and Yasuke.</p>
<p>It features interviews with game director Charles Benoit, who's previously worked as a designer on games like&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/immortals-fenyx-rising"><em>Immortals Fenyx Rising</em></a>, and associate narrative director Brooke Davies.</p>
<p>You can check that video out here if you want to know more about what Ubisoft has in store for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. It's expected to return to the open-world RPG stylings of&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla&nbsp;</em>after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back">back-to-basics experiment of&nbsp;<em>Mirage</em></a>.</p>
<p>The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 15th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>After being unceremoniously thrown into the spotlight yesterday with a pre-reveal leak, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> has been given a proper unveiling via a flashy cinematic trailer, confirming both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ac-game-set-in-feudal-japan-is-called-assassins-creed-shadows-may-have-leaked-its-own-release-date">its leaked November release date</a> and revealing that we’ll be playing as two protagonists for the first time in the series since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Syndicate</a> almost a decade ago. One of those heroes will also be the series’ first playable real-life figure: the African samurai Yasuke.</p>

<p>Yes, as it turns out, ‘Shadows’ does indeed mean multiple playable protagonists, making the long-expected ‘Assassin’s Creed ninja game’ both a ninja AND samurai game. Sneaky shinobi Naoe fits into the classic mould of Assassin’s Creed, uh, assassins, specialising in creeping up on targets - helped by the ability to zip around using a new grappling hook - and stabbing them with the familiar hidden blade.</p>
<p>While Naoe is the fictional daughter of a real-life figure of the time, legendary ninja leader Fujibayashi Nagato, Yasuke is himself a real-life person - the first time players have taken control of an actual historical figure in Assassin’s Creed rather than just chatting to them. The African-born swordsman is renowned for being Japan’s first Black samurai, serving under famous daimyo Oda Nobunaga - known for working to unify the country in the 16th century. (Nobunaga’s efforts would ultimately be completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu - the inspiration for Toranaga in recent and very excellent TV show Shogun.)</p>
<p>Compared to Naoe’s stealthy focus, Yasuke will excel more in direct combat - making his playstyle closer to the action-RPG feel of more recent Assassin’s Creed games or the similarly samurai-focused <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>

<p>While we don’t see any actual gameplay in the cinematic trailer - nice as it looks and all - <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">IGN</a> wrangled some more details out of developers Ubisoft, including info on a reworked lighting system that will help Naoe to hide in the - ahem - shadows like Sam Fisher, the grappling hook traversal I mentioned above, which can also be used to assassinate like a deadly Spider-Gwen, and a reworking of the underlying Anvil engine that’ll let Yasuke’s samurai sword cut into objects realistically, which made me think of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a>’s still-unparalleled melon-slicing tech. There’ll apparently be the chance to engage in some classic Kurosawa-like samurai duels, too.</p>
<p>The world will also be more dynamic, cycling through the seasons in a way that will encourage the player to adapt. One example given was that a pond you might be able to duck under during summer could be frozen over during winter, removing a hiding spot. Another was that grass might be tall enough to sneak through in spring, but vanishes in autumn. The seasons will affect the entirety of Shadows’ map, which was compared to the size of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a> in its recreation of central Japan.</p>
<p>We’ll see and hear more ahead of Shadows’ November 15th release date sometime next month, according to Ubisoft. As an unabashed liker of Assassin’s Creed, samurai and ninja, though, I’m certainly intrigued.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been fully revealed and is making its way to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC later this year on November 15. It’s a monumental title from Ubisoft that’s sure to revive the Assassin’s Creed franchise even more than Mirage did when it was released in October 2023. In the all-new cinematic trailer that was recently revealed, we received an epic showcase of the two brand-new characters that are fronting Assassin’s Creed Shadows: a Shinobi named Naeo and a Samurai called Yasuke.</p>



<p>This dual-protagonist system might seem familiar as it smacks of the core mechanic present in 2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, which was set in Victorian London and also featured a dual-protagonist system made up of a male-female split.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-syndicate-but-with-samurai-and-shinobi">Syndicate But With Samurai and Shinobi</h2>



<p>On the surface, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Assassin’s Creed Syndicate couldn’t be more different. They’re poles apart in terms of their setting, their respective places in the overall timeline, and the story that unravels throughout a lengthy playthrough.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYVRifBnD2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>But at the heart of both games sits an identical dynamic: a dual-protagonist system built on the foundation of one male and one female character. </p>



<p>Yasuke and Naoe have dramatically different backgrounds, while Assassin’s Creed Syndicate’s Jacob and Evie Frye are biological brother and sister – twins, in fact. However, from the trailer that was released by Ubisoft recently, we get the stark impression that these two duos will function in a very similar – if not identical – way. </p>



<p>In Syndicate, Evie Frye was an agile, quiet, and stealthier character, relying more on subterfuge and weapons like throwing knives to get the job done. Jacob, on the other hand, was brash, heavy-set, and preferred an open brawl to a silent dagger in the back. From what we’ve seen, Naoe and Yasuke will function the same way, with the former utilising ‘ninja skills’ to fly around the map fluidly, while Yasuke makes use of heavy weapons, thick armour, and full-frontal attacks to achieve his goals.</p>



<p>At any point, players can switch between the two characters to take on missions how they see fit, but it’s widely assumed that they’ll have ‘character-locked’ missions that only one or the other can undertake – which is how things worked for Jacob and Evie Frye.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has canceled Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland. The decision comes three years after the free-to-play shooter was initially announced.</p>



<p>“After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately,” the company said in a statement to Insider Gaming. “Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”</p>



<p>The news of the game’s cancellation was told to staff in an email on Wednesday morning, ahead of <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s earnings call</a>. In the earnings report, Ubisoft said the decision comes as part of the company’s “increased selectivity of its investments”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game saw a significant shift in its design since its announcement and we’ll share more details on what the game entailed at a later date.</p>



<p>Throughout its development, the game has seen multiple betas with players and was even rated by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-heartland-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taiwanese ratings board</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1790784564354281779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson</a>, the playtests and betas “didn’t resonate with players”.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the statement above, development of the game was being led by Red Storm Entertainment, the studio behind the original Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon games.</p>



<p>The news of the game’s cancellation also comes the same day when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest installment in the Assassin’s Creed franchise</a>, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, was officially revealed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-40-details-you-need-to-know<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After years of fans asking for a feudal Japan-set game, Ubisoft has finally announced Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Set during the era of samurai and shinobi, it brings elegant katana duels and the ninja arts to the franchise. </p><p>IGN recently visited Ubisoft Québec for an exclusive look inside Assassin’s Creed Shadows, where we spoke to seven different developers about what they’ve been creating. You can check out our in-depth interview to learn more, but if you like your details in quick-fire list formats then you’re in the right place. Here’s everything we know about Assassin’s Creed Shadows so far.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><h2>The Setting</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes place in the Azuchi-Momoyama period of Japanese history. The story begins in 1579 and will continue into the early 1580s. The time period means this is the first game in the series to feature the Assassins and Templars in their ‘classic’ forms since 2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.  </li><li>A number of historical figures play prominent roles in the campaign. These include Oda Nobunaga, the “great unifier” of Japan, and Fujibayashi Nagato, a master ninja of the Iga clan.   </li><li>Much like Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, Shadows features two protagonists and you can switch between them as you play through the campaign. The first of these dual leads is Naoe, the fictional daughter of Fujibayashi Nagato. She is trained by her father to be a skilled shinobi.</li><li>The second protagonist is Yasuke, a real historical figure. Originally from Africa, Yasuke came to Japan with the Portuguese in 1579 and soon became a samurai in the employ of Lord Oda Nobunaga. Shadows is the first Assassin’s Creed game to ever let you play as a real person from the past. </li></ul><h2>Stealth and Parkour</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>As the title suggests, light and dark is a major part of Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth systems. A new global illumination system creates dynamic light and shadows that affect enemy vision. You can now hide in shadows and even create darkness by destroying lanterns or killing torch carriers. A light meter on the UI shows how well concealed you are, from fully visible to completely hidden. </li><li>Servants are a new type of NPC, ranking between civilians and enemies. While they cannot fight, they are able to call in reinforcements and raise alarms. They have their own patrol routes, and carry lanterns at night.</li><li>There is now the option to knock out foes when performing a stealth takedown, allowing for a more pacifist playthrough.</li><li>You can now crawl along the ground in a prone position, allowing you to maintain a lower profile as well as get through small openings. </li><li>Naoe has a grappling hook that can be attached to every roof edge, as well as a number of other anchor points. Unlike the zipline-like grappling hook from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, this rope uses physics simulation to allow dynamic swinging.</li><li>The grappling hook can be used to quickly climb into the ceiling space above corridors, allowing you to lay in wait for enemies patrolling beneath you. </li><li>Eagle vision returns, allowing you to spot silhouettes of NPCs through walls. Enemies are marked in red, while the new servants are coloured orange. </li><li>The drone-like bird, used in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla to scout out areas and mark targets, is not available in Shadows. You’ll need to do your own reconnaissance work. </li><li>As a shinobi, Naoe is the most skilled at stealth. Yasuke can use stealth, but his size and armour plating means he’s better at using those skills to get the drop on targets rather than perform a fully silent infiltration. </li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Combat and RPG Systems</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>This era of Japanese warfare did not make use of shields, so your gear does not include any defensive options aside from your armour. Dodges and positioning is paramount. </li><li>As a samurai, Yasuke is able to use his weapon to block incoming attacks and perform parries. Naoe is able to engage in combat, but she is unable to block or parry – instead she can ‘deflect’ enemy blows. Ubisoft didn’t clarify the difference between paries and deflects, but it may be that parries enable counter attacks while deflects are a more evasive tactic.</li><li>Enemy armour has a durability system and can be broken during combat.</li><li>Pretty much every prop in the game is able to be dynamically damaged by your weapons. Katanas will slice through bushes and baskets Fruit Ninja-style, leaving accurate blade marks. Arrows will leave precise puncture marks, while blunt weapons will smash pots into tiny pieces.  </li><li>Many period accurate weapons are available to use, including katanas, the kanabō war club, yari spears, shuriken, kunai, and the kusarigama (a sickle on a chain). </li><li>Yasuke is able to use arquebus rifles, providing him with a powerful long-range option. </li><li>Each weapon has its own skill tree. Investing time into using a particular weapon will improve your proficiency with it. </li><li>You can craft your own katana from gathered components and personalise it. A transmog system will also allow you to tailor your gear to look exactly how you want it. </li><li>Active combat skills return and are unlocked by finding Ninja Scrolls in the world. </li><li>Yasuke and Naoe have individual skill trees and gear, but share XP, collected weapons, and resources. </li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exclusive Concept Art</h3></div></output><h2>Dynamic World and Seasons</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is built upon a newly updated version of the Anvil game engine. The new tech allows for better lighting through global illumination, the new breakable props, more detailed asset meshes, and much less pop-in.</li><li>The new Anvil upgrade has allowed for a season system that sees the world progress through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The current season is dictated by your progress through the campaign in order to maintain historical accuracy, but there are ‘steps’ that each period goes through to create a sense of authenticity. </li><li>Each season comes with unique features that link to gameplay. For example, in the spring and summer when plants bloom and flower, there will be bushes and long grass to hide in. Later, in autumn and winter, those plants will die and thus remove hiding spots. Water also freezes in winter, which prevents you from entering pools and ponds. Icicles will form on rooftop edges and can fall if disturbed, potentially giving away your position. </li><li>Seasons also affect NPC behaviours. In the summer, enemy samurai cut through bushes in search of you. In the winter, foes stay close to fires and warm places, potentially opening up new, colder paths for you to take. </li><li>A fully dynamic weather system provides appropriate climate conditions based on both the region and season. Severe weather, like deep fog, howling winds, and snow impacts enemy sight and sound. A storm is an opportunity to mask your footsteps. </li><li>The world features a surprisingly detailed ecology system. In spring, for instance, wind will blow gusts of pollen that have been spawned by trees, replicating a real ecosystem. </li><li>The map is similar in size to that featured in Assassin's Creed Origins, and replicates the central region of Japan.</li><li>The map is divided into regions based on Japan’s real historical provinces, including Iga (the home of the shinobi), Arima (the location of a major battle), and Omi (an agriculture “bread basket” region.) </li><li>The iconic synchronisation points return, but in a reimagined way. Climbing to the top no longer plots a multitude of icons on your map, nor does it trigger the spinning ‘drone’ shot of the area. Instead, from this vantage point you’re able to survey the area for highlighted points of interest, which you can then seek out when back on the ground. Ubisoft expressed a wish for there to be less icons this time around, and so this appears to be one way of fulfilling that. Thankfully, despite this slight change, synchronisation points still act as fast travel locations. </li><li>Shadows is set during a time of flourishing urbanisation, trade, and warfare. This allows for a wide range of locations, including towns, trading posts, farm land, and colossal castles that have been rendered at near 1:1 scale.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This year the Animus, Ubisoft’s memory-hopping time machine, is taking us back to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-and-where-is-assassins-creed-shadows-set">16th century Japan</a> in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Naturally that means we’ll be exploring the life of a Japanese character – the daughter of famed ninja master Fujibayashi Nagato. But Shadows has a second protagonist: an African samurai. If you’re surprised to see a man of such origins wielding a katana, you may not know his fascinating true story. This is Yasuke, Japan’s first Black samurai, and the first real historical person to be a playable protagonist in an Assassin’s Creed game. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><h2>Origins</h2><p>You may have come across Yasuke before, as he’s been depicted in Netflix’s Yasuke anime series, as well as made an appearance in the Nioh games, but little is known about his life before his days as a samurai, including his original name - ‘Yasuke’ was bestowed on him during his stay in Japan. But historians believe he was born in West Africa. Thomas Lockley, co-author of ‘African Samurai: The True Story of Yasuke, a Legendary Black Warrior in Feudal Japan’, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/#:~:text=says%20it%E2%80%99s%20possible%20Yasuke%20was%20enslaved%20and%20trafficked%20as%20a%20child" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theories he was enslaved and trafficked as a child</a>. </p><p>The historical details of his departure from Africa are equally unclear, but some scholars believe that he left his homeland as a mercenary. Later, he met Alessandro Valignano – an Italian Jesuit missionary who would <a href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/#:~:text=They%20came%20by%20way%20of%20India%2C%20and%20according%20to%20Lockley%2C%20Yasuke%20was%20in%20service%20to%20Valignano%20most%20likely%20as%20a%20bodyguard.%20%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20priest%20he%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20allowed%20to%20have%20any%20soldiers%20or%20guards%2C%E2%80%9D%20Lockley%20said%20of%20the%20Jesuit%20missionary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employ Yasuke as something of a bodyguard</a>. Valignano planned to travel to Japan, which at the time was locked in a civil war, and so would need protection. </p><p>The two arrived in Japan in 1579 (the year Assassin’s Creed Shadows begins), and the tall African mercenary stunned the Japanese locals. In <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yasuke#:~:text=As%20recorded%20in%20the%20diary%20of%20the%20samurai%20Matsudaira%20Ietada%2C%20%E2%80%9CHis%20%5BYasuke%E2%80%99s%5D%20height%20was%206%20shaku%202%20sun%20%5Broughly%206%20feet%202%20inches%20(1.88%20metres)%5D%E2%80%A6he%20was%20black%2C%20and%20his%20skin%20was%20like%20charcoal.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a diary from that year</a>, the samurai Matsudaira Ietada wrote "His height was 6 shaku 2 sun [roughly 6 feet, 2 inches]... he was black, and his skin was like charcoal." </p><p>For two years Yasuke aided Valignano with his Jesuit missions. But In 1581, on a trip to Kyoto, the African mercenary’s life would be changed forever. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/640px-black-sumo-wrestler-in-17th-century-1715692530363.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A panel from the Sumō Yūrakuzu Byōbu, drawn in 1605. It is possible that the artwork depicts Yasuke. </figcaption></figure></output><h2>Nobunaga’s Black Samurai</h2><p>Valignano visited Kyoto for an audience with daimyō Oda Nobunaga, the feudal lord who had recently unified half of Japan. Valignano sought Nobunaga to ask permission to leave the country, but during their meeting the daimyō became fascinated by the Jesuit’s African bodyguard. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.heritagedaily.com/2021/05/yasuke-the-african-samurai/138929#:~:text=The%20Shinch%C5%8D%20k%C5%8Dki,this%20first%20meeting.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chronicle of Nobunaga</a> written in Japan’s Edo period, The Shinchō kōki, describes the meeting: “On the 23rd of the 2nd, a black page came from the Christian countries. The man was healthy with a good demeanour and Nobunaga praised Yasuke’s strength. Nobunaga’s nephew gave him a sum of money at this first meeting.” </p><p>While many African people lived in Japan in the 16th century, working as interpreters, soldiers, and other professions, it may be that Nobunaga had never encountered someone with dark skin before. “Yasuke was brought before Nobunaga and he didn’t believe Yasuke’s true skin color was black,” said Thomas Lockley in an interview with <a href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>. The daimyō apparently ordered him to be scrubbed, believing his colour was due to paint or dirt. When learning the truth, Nobunaga threw a welcome party. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke#:~:text=The%20black%20man,lord%22).%5Bf%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1582 Annual Report of the Jesuit Mission in Japan</a>, Portuguese missionary Luís Fróis wrote that, “The black man understood a little Japanese, and Nobunaga never tired of talking with him,” and that “Some people in the town thought that Nobunaga might make him as tono [a high-ranking samurai].”  </p><p>Yasuke was reportedly incredibly strong, and thus an ideal candidate for a samurai. In The Chronicle of Lord Nobunaga, written by one of the lord’s followers in the 17th century, Yasuke is described as “[appearing] to be 26 or 27 years old. … This man looked robust and had a good demeanor. What is more, his formidable strength surpassed that of ten men.” <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithsonian Magazine</a> notes that other historic reports compliment his intelligence and imposing stature. </p><p>While Nobunaga employed thousands of samurai, Yasuke was his first foreign-born warrior. According to Lockley, he was part of the lord’s <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cthe%20very%20small%20entourage%20around%20Nobunaga%2C%20which%20%5Bwas%5D%20probably%20around%2030%20to%2050%20%5Bwarriors%5D%2C%20mainly%20young%20men%2C%20many%20of%20%5Bwhom%20were%20Nobunaga%E2%80%99s%5D%20lovers%20as%20well%2C%E2%80%9D%20Lockley%20says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“very small entourage.”</a> </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/oda-nobunaga-1715693075944.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ukiyo-e of Oda Nobunaga, made by Utagawa Kuniyoshi in 1830 for the "Kuniyoshi's Warriors" collection.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Nobunaga’s Downfall</h2><p>Yasuke’s career in service of Nobunaga was short-lived. In the year following their first meeting, the daimyō was betrayed by one of his own generals. On June 21, 1582, Akechi Mitsuhide ambushed Nobunaga in Kyoto with thousands of troops. At the Honnō-ji temple, Nobunaga performed seppuku, the ritual suicide in which a person disembowls themself. While it’s believed that Nobunaga’s lover, Mori Ranmaru, acted as his second – cutting off the lord’s head to complete the ritual – <a href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/#:~:text=Yasuke%20was%20in%20the%20temple%20with%20Nobunaga%20when%20he%20performed%20seppuku.%20%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20no%20record%2C%20but%20tradition%20holds%20it%20that%20%5BYasuke%5D%20was%20the%20one%20who%20took%20Nobunaga%E2%80%99s%20head%20to%20save%20it%20from%20the%20enemy%2C%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tradition claims that Yasuke was tasked with taking Nobunaga’s head</a> so that it wouldn’t fall into the hands of the enemy. </p><p>With his lord gone, Yasuke is said to have sought out Nobunaga’s son, Oda Nobutada, who was nearby. He fought with Nobutada’s men against Mitsuhide, but they were completely outnumbered. Lockley believes Yasuke was likely left wounded on the battlefield. The last historical record of Yasuke states he was escorted by Akechi’s troops to a Jesuit mission house. “What we do know is that Mitsuhide did not execute Yasuke,” explained historian Natalia Doan to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20we%20do%20know%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Doan%2C%20%E2%80%9Cis%20that%20Mitsuhide%20did%20not%20execute%20Yasuke.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithsonian Magazine</a>.   </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/yasuke-anime-netflix-1715692784512.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Yasuke featured as the protagonist in Netflix's 2021 anime adaptation of the samurai's story. </figcaption></figure></output><h2>Pop-Culture Legacy</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Talking to IGN</a>, Sachi Schmidt-Hori – a Professor of Japanese Literature and Culture working with Ubisoft on Assassin’s Creed Shadows – says “Yasuke has been featured in many creative writings and media. If you go to Wikipedia for Yasuke's page, there's a long, long list of novels, TV series, dramas that have been inspired by him, he as a historical character or somebody who was inspired by him. I think people in Japan really, really embrace him as a character, and we really like to see him representing the samurai spirit.”</p><p>In Japan, one of the most famous stories influenced by his life is Kuro-suke by Kurusu Yoshio, which received the Japanese Association of Writers for Children Prize in 1969. In 1971, Shūsaku Endō published the satirical novel Kuronbō, which was also inspired by Yasuke. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A number of Japanese period dramas about Yasuke have been produced, and he has appeared as a character in the manga series Hyouge Mono, The Man Who Killed Nobunaga, and Nobunaga's Chef. He’s also a side character in Team Ninja’s Nioh games (the first of which also focuses on a foreign samurai, William Adams.) </p><p>In more recent years, the legendary warrior has featured as the protagonist of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yasuke-season-1-review-netflix-lakeith-stanfield">Netflix anime series Yasuke</a>, voiced by LaKeith Stanfield. He was also set to be the central figure of a Lionsgate-produced live action movie called Black Samurai, with the late Chadwick Boseman planned to portray him. Earlier this year, a spec script written by Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz “the Ambassador” Bazawule, also called Black Samurai, was acquired by Warner Bros. Bazawule is set to direct.  </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/madfinger-games-will-patch-gray-zone-warfare-grenade-exploit-that-has-been-plaguing-players-at-home-base/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=madfinger-games-will-patch-gray-zone-warfare-grenade-exploit-that-has-been-plaguing-players-at-home-base<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Kicking back at home base is one of the only comforts of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/will-gray-zone-warfare-ever-have-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone Warfare</a>,&nbsp;</em>where you can temporarily put your mind at ease. Unfortunately, several players disrupt the peace through a pesky grenade exploit, stealing gear from their own teammates. The issue will, thankfully, be resolved soon now that it’s on Madfinger Games’ radar.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">The exploit unfolds in a rather cunning manner. It begins when a fellow player from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gray-zone-warfare-factions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your faction</a> hurls a grenade at you and then abruptly exits the game.&nbsp;This action, while they are no longer in the server, inflicts fatal damage to your character. To add insult to injury, another player, presumably on lookout duty, swoops in to loot your gear.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can kill your own faction members at base camp with this new grenade bug in Gray Zone Warfare 😔 I've seen this a lot more often in the past 24 hours and this 100% needs to be fixed ASAP or it will cause players to quit. <a href="https://t.co/vlrHMwsIJ5">pic.twitter.com/vlrHMwsIJ5</a></p>— Martonic (@MartonicTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/MartonicTV/status/1790675723147149702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">While this exploit&nbsp;has been a source of frustration and betrayal, the community’s vigilance has not gone unnoticed. Madfinger Games has caught wind of the issue, indicating that it will be “resolved soon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes indeed. This has unfortunately been an exploit for some time now. This will be resolved soon. Stay tuned.</p>— Gray Zone Warfare (@GrayZoneWarfare) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrayZoneWarfare/status/1790710322182922549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">It’s unclear how the team will handle this exploit. Some players have suggested the team put a dud grenade instead while at home base. That way, it won’t result in your demise. But, in the meantime, users have found a temporary solution where you can select the ‘Safely End Deployment’ button to save your gear.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Since its launch, Madfinger Games has released a few hotfixes to resolve issues like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gray-zone-warfare-hotfix-3-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappearing head</a>. However, the game has yet to have a major update with its official Patch 1. The grenade exploit could be fixed through this patch, but there isn’t an exact timeframe on the matter.</p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">For now, you may just want to keep a watchful eye on your own teammates. You never know when you might get stabbed in the back.</p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Airship Syndicate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1171690/view/4174350531696890458?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> that the troubled MMO <em>Wayfinder</em> will be course-correcting. The developer is dropping the online requirement for the game, and removing all microtransactions. It will now be a single, upfront fee to purchase.</p> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Remember <em>Wayfinder</em>? I haven’t thought about it in quite a while. To say its launch was troubled is a bit of an understatement. On the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/online-arpg-wayfinder-hits-early-access-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day of its launch</a>, it garnered nearly 8,000 negative use reviews on Steam, and things have not really improved. Looking at reviews from around the time it released, players complained primarily about bugs, server issues, and numerous other issues alongside.</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Back in April, Airship Syndicate announced that they’d be going separate ways with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/digital-extremes-cuts-jobs-closes-external-projects-division/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publisher Digital Extremes</a> and removed <em>Wayfinder </em>from sale temporarily. At the time, the developer hinted that there would be some change, but the language implied it was going to continue being a largely online game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">After consideration, <em>Airship Syndicate </em>is shifting <em>Wayfinder</em> to a primarily single-player game. There will still be three-player co-op, but it will be entirely peer-to-peer.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">A lot of new negative reviews are from players who purchased an MMO only to have it shift into single-player. I totally understand the frustration. It’s pretty terrible for anyone who already dropped money on in-game currency and items. Airship Syndicate has said that these things will be shifted into the offline version, but without the MMO part of the game, those items (and especially the currency) have lost their perceived value.</p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">However, I think the alternative here would be for <em>Wayfinder</em> to shut down and disappear entirely. And then nobody gets anything. It would just be another dead MMO in a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/update-marvel-heroes-shuts-down-with-immediate-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sea of corpses</a>. The developer and publisher had the responsibility to deliver a game that survived and thrived, and failed to provide one that lasted even a year. That warrants anger, and the onus is on Airship Syndicate to smooth things over. As it stands, at least it’s not nothing.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">The current plan is to soft-launch <em>Wayfinder</em> to all existing owners on May 31st, followed by a broader release into Early Access on June 11th on PC. For PlayStation people, the relaunch with the Echoes Update will be sometime in the Summer. They plan on having the full launch take place sometime in the Fall for all platforms.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and, following a whole host of leaks in the last two days, confirmed details surrounding its story and lead characters, as well as the release date. Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on 15th November for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Mac &amp; Luna.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official Cinematic World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>

<p>Here’s a bit more of a dive into who these characters are:</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s not just this pair, as you’ll be able to build your own spy network to feed you information on new areas and hunt targets. Allies can also be recruited and help during missions with customisable hideouts where you can train your crew.</p>
<p>There will be three editions of the game, beyond the Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gold Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass (including a bonus quest with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions) and 3 days early access to the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack and 3 days early access to the game. The Ultimate Pack will contain the Sekiryu Character Pack (Naoe and Yasuke outfit and weapon, trinket and mount), the Sekiryu Hideout Pack, 5 Skill points and a Red and black photo mode filter.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector’s Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack, physical content and 3 days early access to the game. The physical content will be a Steelbook, the World map, Naoe &amp; Yasuke Figurine, life-size Naoe’s Katana Tsuba, a Wall Creed Scroll, an 84 pages collector’s artbook and 2 sumi-e lithographs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Extra subscribers also get sci-fi survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn, family friendly action-adventure The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, open-world hacking action in Watch Dogs 2, and Cat Quest 1 &amp; 2 - two super-streamlined, wonderfully approachable mini-RPGs that are a bit of a treat.

            <p>Alzara Radiant Echoes is a clear love letter to golden age JRPGs, pulling inspiration from the likes of Golden Sun and Lost Odyssey for a 3D turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a Mediterranean fantasy world. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> composer Motoi Sakuraba is on board, along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and Fire Emblem artist Yoshiro Ambe. And if that hadn’t already sold me already, developers Studio Camelia are also paying tribute to the best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy game</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/StudioCamelia_/status/1788627413791866949">FFIX</a>, obviously.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>Alzara makes no bones about the fact it’s heavily indebted to JRPG classics, throwing the likes of Persona, Chrono Cross and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy X</a> on top of its already teetering pile of inspirations. Its titular world is built on the familiar four-element foundations of Fire, Air, Water and Earth seen in the likes of the original Final Fantasy (plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-iv">FFIV</a>), as well as bringing in another key inspiration for its elemental-based battles: Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>
<p>The story follows element-harnessing hero Kayla as she forms a party with a group of companions (stop me if you’ve heard this one before) and Alzara’s resistance to help fend off an invasion from the neighbouring nation of Vedores. The setting pulls in real-world inspiration from southern France to Greece and Egypt, with players able to eventually set sail around the Taqsim archipelago and wider open world in a boat - because, of course.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/alzara-radiant-echoes-town.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Studio Camelia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, all fairly familiar stuff, but Alzara looks like it will have the gameplay goods to back up its grab-bag of inspirations. Using elements in battles works much like the rock-paper-scissors combos of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/pokemon">Pokémon</a> or Persona, with certain elements being stronger against others and specialising in different combat techniques - whether the defensive Earth, offensive Fire, fast-and-furious Air or supportive Water.</p>
<p>How you arrange your allies will also play a role, with sticking them up front draining their resource of Echo - requiring exhausted heroes to swap out to the back row to catch a breather and refill their energy. Swap with a character whose Echo is full and they’ll jump in with an extra opening move, too. Swapping also allows those core elements to be combined into new elements, not unlike in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a> (through presumably with less explosive chaos) - Fire and Air create Thunder, for example, while mixing Water and Earth will get you Plant.</p>
<p>There’s an equivalent of Final Fantasy’s summons in here too, with Legends being brought into battle by making offerings - a temporary stats debuff that will stack Favours, which can then be spent on powerful moves. How many Favours you stack determines the strength of the attack, in an interesting twist to the fixed cost of traditional summons.</p>

<p>Alzara’s first gameplay trailer looks and sounds the part thanks to the presence of Souls and Golden Sun co-composer Sakuraba and the character designs of Ambe, who has also worked on Fire Emblem Heroes and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trials-of-mana">Trials of Mana</a> alongside Genshin. The art style and animation look very slick indeed, with the flashes of combat gameplay and puzzle-dungeon exploration very much tickling my itch for modern takes on turn-based battles and open-world exploration.</p>
<p>The game is already galloping towards its crowdfunding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics">over on Kickstarter</a>, with the aim of raising €100,000 to fund a release on Steam (and consoles) in 2026.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week Ubisoft finally shone a light on <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the new Feudal Japan-set RPG-style adventure from the team at Ubisoft Quebec, that was originally known by the codename <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Red</a>. Since then, a few other tidbits have leaked, including a release date and some details about the game’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pricing-and-season-pass-dlc-plan-have-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC and pricing plans</a>. That said, fans were understandably still hungry for more.</p>
<p>Well, today Ubisoft dropped the first trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. It’s only cinematic, so we can’t glean <em>too</em> much about how the game might look during actual gameplay, but it provides a pretty in-depth look at our new protagonists. As previously rumored, Shadows will focus on a male samurai, based on real-life historical figure Yasuke, and a female ninja/shinobi named Naoe. Unlike past dual-protagonist Assassin’s Creed games, the two will play quite differently, with Naoe being about stealth and gadgets, while Yasuke is more of a brawler, wielding heavy weapons. Check out the Assassin’s Creed Shadows cinematic trailer, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official World Premiere Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ developers discussing our new protagonists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2LH4Ael4X1TlNJY3B3aYg5/assassins-creed-shadows-launches-november-15-features-dual-protagonists-in-feudal-japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit more detail about both Yasuke and Naoe</a>, and how they relate to one another…</p>
<p><em>"While Naoe and Yasuke play very differently – Naoe is a shinobi who uses stealth, parkour, and gadgets, whereas Yasuke is combat-oriented and armored – the pair’s personalities ultimately complement each other to form a unique dynamic throughout Shadows."</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Yasuke: A Real-Life Samurai</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“The decision to include a playable, real-life historical figure of this era in Assassins’ Creed Shadows was two-fold: Ubisoft Quebec wanted to include a Samurai, and Yasuke’s story was open-ended enough to allow for creativity; there are still plenty of questions and speculation surrounding him. The fascinating facts, though, were undisputable: of African origin, he arrived in Japan enslaved by the Portuguese; he impressed with size, strength, and wits; he served under the Japanese daimyo Oda Nobunaga.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Naoe: The Blade of the People</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“At Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ start, Naoe is a 17-year-old from Iga, and the daughter of one of the era’s most iconic shinobi, Fujibayashi Nagato, who – despite a promise to keep her safe – is forced to train her to be his equal in battle. The team describes Naoe as ‘determined but compassionate,’ capable of taking down any enemy while showing compassion to victims of war and corruption. With her home province of Iga squarely in the path of Nobunaga’s conquest, she sees first-hand the destruction that war can bring, and vows to use her skills to help her people.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFassassinscreedshadows2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>Two Sides of the Same Coin</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ dual protagonists are ultimately brought together by Nobunaga, whose goal of unifying Japan takes his army – and Yasuke – to the province of Iga for the Second Tenshō Iga War. The Igan resistance, though greatly overpowered by Nobunaga’s army, is courageously led by Naoe’s father. The two protagonists find each other through Nobunaga, although, for obvious reasons, they don’t exactly get off to a great start. The pair provide the player with opposing perspectives on Nobunaga and the means he used to achieve his goal of unification, and their overlapping perspectives throughout Shadows ultimately allow for a more nuanced look at the late Sengoku period.</em></p>
<p><em>The difference in their social stature is reflected in the world itself, which will respond differently to the player depending on who they are playing as. Naoe, for example, can present herself as a peasant and garner appropriate reactions; that is, if she wants to be seen at all. Yasuke, on the other hand, comes from a different land, but his status as a samurai garners respect from others, so people will bow to him on the streets. Characters can have different expectations of the pair, and in some cases, will prefer to deal with only one or the other.</em></p>
<p><em>Naoe and Yasuke’s disparate personalities also lead them to have different relationships and rapports with other characters, and they don’t always feel the same way about people, nor do people always feel the same way about them. Romantically, they will also attract and be attracted to different types of people. Through the pair, players will get to experience a multitude of relationships.”</em></p>
<p>In addition to the unique dual-protagonist structure, Ubisoft promises Assassin’s Creed Shadows will include new features, like changing seasons, and a focus on light and shadow during gameplay enabled by a new global illumination system. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An IGN article provides a few more details</a>, including that you’ll be able to choose which character you can play as for <em>most</em> missions, although there will be a few story missions specifically tied to Yasuke or Naoe. As previously rumored, destructible environments are also part of the game, which will be particularly evident when wrecking shop as Yasuke. Parkour is getting some tweaks too, including a grappling hook when playing as Naoe. Overall, Ubisoft is promising more open, non-linear mission design, and yes, knocking out enemies returns so you can do a true pacifist run.</p>
<p>Of course, this being an Ubisoft game, there will be multiple purchasing options, including a $70 standard edition, $110 Gold Edition, and $130 Premium Edition. <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/assassins-creed-shadows/660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders are open now</a>, and all who put their money down get access to the “Thrown to the Dogs” bonus mission. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the special editions…</p>
<p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Base Game and pre-order bonus</em></li>
<li><em>Season Pass including two story expansions</em></li>
<li><em>3-day early access</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Premium Edition</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Everything included in the Gold Edition, plus…</em></li>
<li><em>The Sekiryu Character Pack including gear and weapon sets for both Naoe and Yasuke, featuring the Sekiryu Beast, and Dragon Tooth trinket.</em></li>
<li><em>The Sekiryu Hideout Pack including four unique ornaments to customize the hideout for your shinobi league.</em></li>
<li><em>Five skill points.</em></li>
<li><em>The Red Dragon filter in Photo mode</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows sneaks onto PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on November 15 of this year. Actual gameplay will be shared at the Ubisoft Forward show in June. What do you think? Are you sharpening your katanas in anticipation?</p>
