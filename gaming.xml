            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my 27 years on God’s green earth, I have never encountered a more soul-crushing recreational experience than discovering a revolutionary manga, only to follow its wondrous narrative to the end of its rainbow and find no conclusion. I’m once bitten with the late, great Kentaro Miura’s <em>Berserk</em>, twice shy with Takehiko Inoue’s <em>Vagabond</em>, and irreparably fucked up from Ai Yazawa’s best-selling shojo manga, <a href="https://www.viz.com/nana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Nana</em></a>, being <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended in an indefinite hiatus</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After years of resigning myself to a 'crab in a barrel' existence, plunging friends and strangers alike into the depths of <em>Nana</em>'s<em> </em>devastating 15-year-long cliffhanger like a siren's call to a weary sailor, I've lucked upon novel escape from mutually assured destruction: putting folks onto Yen Press’ brand new “Green Yuri” manga. This manga not only stands as the closest spiritual successor to <em>Nana</em>, it also ventures where Ai Yazawa's masterpiece never tread: Letting its girls be in lesbians with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nana Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXbJzu7zF8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h3><em>Nana </em>will break you (like a rose)</h3><p><em>Nana</em>'s elevator pitch is pretty straightforward. It centers on two disparate women named Nana, who become roommates in Tokyo, develop a close friendship, and e<a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/nana-teaches-readers-how-to-mourn-a-friendship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventually drift apart as they chase their dreams</a>. While the effervescent and naïve Nana Komatsu and the cynical punk rockstar vocalist Nana Osaki personify the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/black-and-pink-meme-houses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black and pink houses meme</a>, they both deeply long to be loved. While Komatsu pursues love through comfort from people—deserving or otherwise—Osaki safeguards attachments with a chosen few by confining them to her orbit. Despite inevitably winding up in hetero relationships, Osaki and Komatsu frequently reminisce about their platonic love.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of the manga, <em>Nana</em>’s success spun off into an anime adaptation by <em>Trigun </em>and <em>Death Note</em> animation studio Madhouse and two criminally underappreciated (and hard to find by legal means) live action movie adaptations. <em>Nana</em>’s impact expands beyond anime and manga by having a cultural cache in the fashion world thanks to Yazawa kitting out its cast in Viviene Westwood’s lavish clothes and accessories. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thewestwoodarchives?igsh=YXZ2Y2J3NG5xNnE3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vivian Westwood Archives Instagram account</a> constantly posts <em>Nana </em>anime<em> </em>screenshots and manga panels while chronicling the fashion icon’s legacy.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">no way i just saw someone say that nana and hachi give off “platonic bestie” vibes and we’re forcing “romantic love” onto them im… ahhh yes platonic love  <a href="https://t.co/qMemCIdJyM">pic.twitter.com/qMemCIdJyM</a></p>— avary 🤍 (@kyoruyeye) <a href="https://twitter.com/kyoruyeye/status/1693619900672295294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>As many a <em>Nana </em>fan will protest, Yazawa’s magnum opus would have been shorter <a href="https://x.com/_forbisexuals/status/1846142339426681261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the two hooked up</a>. Lord knows them kissing, regularly sharing a bed and bathing together, fantasizing about the other doing the beast with two backs with other people, and admitting that they’d fall in love with the other “if they were a boy” doesn’t help fans' long-held exasperation with <em>Nana. </em>It also doesn’t help that it was nearly impossible to acquire legally until Sentai Filmworks, Hidive, and Hulu made it available in 2022 in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the problem with <em>Nana </em>now that it's available in America is that it's hard to recommend to people in good conscience knowing it's still going to ruin their lives forever. Both the manga and the anime end with Osaki and Komatsu not talking to each other for years. What’s more, the poignant narration from them throughout the series are letters the two wish they sent to each other as they recount their friendship. Forget boy’s comics or shonen, girl’s comics, also known as shojo is where real heartbreaking storytelling resides. I’ve shed my fair share of tears thinking about the girls from apartment 707. Enter <em>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Green Yuri</em> will fix you</h3><p><a href="https://usa.kinokuniya.com/the-guy-she-was-interested-in-wasnt-a-guy-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</em></a>, by Sumiko Arai, might have the naming convention of sentence-long run-of-the-mill isekai anime, but contained within the covers is one of the most refreshing, feel-good queer manga on the market right now. <em>TGSWIIWAGAA</em> (we’re calling it <em>Green Yuri</em>&nbsp; for its Brat green cover from here on out) is a yuri manga, meaning it’s a romance between two women. Yuri, otherwise known as Girls Love, are shojo series that follow queer romances between women. While it isn’t as obscure as its Boys Love counterpart, Yaoi, titles like <em>Bloom Into You</em>, <em>How Do We Relationship</em>, and Whisper Me a Love Song have to fight for retail bookstore shelves against popular shonen battle manga like <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, and <em>My Hero Academia</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <em>Nana</em>, <em>Green Yuri</em> follows a stylish teenage girl named Aya Oosawa and a punk girl named Mitsuki Koga, who start crushing on each other after Oosawa stumbles into Koga’s record shop.&nbsp;</p><p>As its name implies, Aya initially believes she’s crushing on a cute emo clerk obscuring his visage behind a face mask—until she discovers she’s been macking on her dorky Clark Kent-looking classmate she sits beside. What follows is an unfolding romance where the two share their love for rock music just like <em>Nana</em>’s Osaki and Komatsu. Only, replace Nana’s affinity for punk bands like The Sex Pistols with Mitsuaya’s zoomer love for grunge and new-age rock bands like Nirvana, Weezer, My Chemical Romance, and Willow. <em>Nana</em> super fans have enjoyed the songs from that series’ fictional bands through the soundtracks and the movies. Taking that baton, <em>Green Yuri</em>’s referential songs can be enjoyed sonically through its <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2hvxjH2Xa8LWZ8lXIEXlQd?si=rhf_IC5yQaujGx6vDMlcew&amp;pi=TS3_QKfjRX-3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Spotify playlist</a>, which updates with each chapter.&nbsp;</p><p>The similarities between <em>Nana </em>and <em>Green Yuri</em> are so uncanny that I often feel like <em>Ratatouille</em>’s Anton Ego or Leonardo Di Caprio’s Rick Dalton whenever I spot them. For one, both series include scenes where one of the girls refers to the other’s unflinching sense of loyalty and codependence to Japan’s best boy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachiko</a>, a loyal shiba inu who waited for his master at the train station, even after his master’s death. The two also share an identical moment where Mitsuki and Osaki perform on <a href="https://x.com/kyoruyeye/status/1846341611199856833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage for their muses</a>, leading the more conventional girls to profess their undying love for their songstresses (in their heads, of course).&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>On a grander scale, what makes <em>Green Yuri</em> so special as a new-age shojo manga—a genre that doesn’t get nearly as much attention as its male-oriented counterpart, shonen—is its popularity. The series went from being an <a href="https://x.com/agu_knzm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing weekly Twitter series</a> Arai would frequently update every Sunday in 2021—utilizing the platform’s four-image limit to <a href="https://x.com/agu_knzm/status/1845375992971620442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create easy to follow chapters</a>— to getting serialized in Pixiv Comic and published and printed by Kadokawa Shonten, to receiving an official English release by Yen Press on October 22. While much of its success is due to the raw artistic talent of Arai, it also owes its rise to prominence with its queer readership who propelled the series from being a word-of-mouth manga darling to an undeniable work of art to big money publishers.&nbsp;</p><p>Witnessing <em>Green Yuri</em>’s grassroots support from the girl’s love community who went from making scanlations of the series for folks to read it in their native language to having <em>Green Yuri</em> break into the mainstream with its <a href="https://x.com/yenpress/status/1827058757064446245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artwork gracing the convention floors</a> of pop culture events like New York Comic Con is an inspiring sight to behold. Especially for a manga subgenre that—like its queer readership—are regularly overlooked and constantly have to fight for their right to exist.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why the manga LOVE BULLET was supported on a global scale" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAXKth-y9Jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What’s more, the same readership who willed <em>Green Yuri</em> into the limelight have been paying it forward by rallying on Twitter to get the word out on <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/love-bullet-manga-inee-sapphic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other ambitious girl’s love series</a> struggling to stave off cancelation like fellow Kadokawa writer and illustrator Inee and their series, <a href="https://x.com/inee/status/1836642815545348099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Love Bullet</em></a>. Through social media campaigns that stretched across Twitter and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yurimemes/comments/1fjjh10/attention_yuri_lovers_love_bullet_needs_your_help/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.cbr.com/love-bullet-sell-out-release-worldwide-fan-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various yuri Reddit communities</a>, <em>Love Bullet</em>’s first volume sold out worldwide across online retailers. The yuri community’s outpour of support. Now the world will have a chance to read a manga about a queer girl who <a href="https://youtu.be/swWm522mnaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;transforms into a gun-wielding cupid</a> upon her untimely death who is tasked with helping her first love find happiness with someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like <em>Love Bullet</em>, <em>Green Yuri</em> is a success story not only for queer manga, but for their passionate fandom. These series experienced continued success through the concerted effort of its readership willing it into the public consciousness by flooding social media with fantastic fan art and testimonials on them being a must-read.. In the case of <em>Love Bullet</em>, the fandom is the only reason why the series continues to be published. Hopefully, these manga won’t have the same ignoble ending as <em>Nana</em>, whose two leads are still in stasis, longing for each other. If you’re still waiting for the two Nanas to kiss, then <em>Green Yuri</em> is here to pick up where they left off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Forever Skies was set to have its full release in 2024, with 1.0 launching on PC and PlayStation. This isn't the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-early-access-has-been-delayed-to-first-half-of-2023/"> first delay</a> that the game has experienced, unfortunately. This time, Far From Home, the developers behind Forever Skies, have decided that the full launch needs to be delayed to early 2025 to ensure that the game has enough polish time. The reason behind the delay is that they've started doing new designs and implementing "substantial changes to many existing systems." Therefore, the delay was needed to make sure the game is the best it can be upon full release.</p>
<p>For those who have been getting stuck into the Early Access period of Forever Skies, there is still more to come. The team behind this game has confirmed that the highly requested 4-player co-op will still be launching on PC Early Access in 2024. While there is no given date, the first Beta tests for the co-op will be starting in the coming weeks, suggesting that it's closer than you may think. Additionally, the game is receiving a 30% discount starting today. If you want to check out the game before the overhaul happens, this is the perfect time to dive into it.</p>
<p>If you are worried about the changes that Far From Home is planning on making to Forever Skies, they've detailed everything in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1641960/view/4505380324428152777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog post</a> that tells you all of the changes and tweaks they're making to ensure that Forever Skies is a great game for those riding solo, or are together in a team.</p>
<p>One of the major things they're changing is the progress overhaul. Currently, the players follow a path naturally that allows them to unlock specific technologies and upgrades. However, this is now being changed so that players can become "much more self-sufficient, especially in the opening hours, while putting more focus on surviving aboard their airship instead of hopping from location to location."</p>
<p>Originally, Forever Skies was going to have procedural generation to place locations on the map. Instead, they are now doing away with that feature and are creating groups of biomes that will spawn specific locations within them. This may seem like an odd choice, as procedural generation can provide a sense of replayability and variety, but the developers feel that it can "sometimes lead to disjointed landscapes and progression."</p>
<p>For those who want to test out the co-op feature, there is a link at the bottom of the Steam blog post that will allow you to sign up for the beta tests. At this time, the co-op is only being planned for PC release, with no word of when co-op will be arriving to PlayStation 5, but it's possible it won't arrive until the full release of the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-mod-hits-a-million-downloads-on-fallout-day.1017402/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ambitious mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>has hit a major download milestone, developer Team FOLON has announced, and the milestone couldn't have come on a more auspicious day for the studio.</p>
<p>As announced by Team FOLON <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1849075003565703208" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>has officially crossed a million downloads since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now">its release back in July</a>, which feels like a pretty good way to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Day if you ask me.</p>
<p>Just in case you're wondering, October 23rd is widely regarded by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fans as&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Day because it's the day on which nuclear weapons were fired in the series' setting, devastating life around the world and creating the post-apocalyptic landscapes in which the games take place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-london-1m-downloads-saint-pauls-sanctuary.jpg?itok=iE06M3mi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-london-1m-downloads-saint-pauls-sanctuary.jpg?itok=jKPePl3Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular among&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fans.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fallout: London</em>'s success feels especially poignant given that&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod that sought to recreate the entirety of the first game in the Bethesda shooter's engine, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended">recently suspended by its developers</a>.</p>
<p>It's also perhaps a better&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Day celebration than Bethesda's official offering, which so far consists of <a href="https://x.com/Fallout/status/1849101170742067581" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some goodies</a> for&nbsp;<em>Fallout Shelter&nbsp;</em>players on mobile. Be still, my beating heart.</p>
<p>To be fair to Bethesda, the studio is also planning a special (or perhaps that should be S.P.E.C.I.A.L.) <a href="https://x.com/Fallout/status/1846567292991099192" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broadcast later today</a> that will show off some "new content in&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>", but I have a feeling that probably won't cut it for&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fans either.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>is, it's a total conversion mod for&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>that contains an entirely new map to explore. You'll never guess which city it is.</p>

<p>The mod also features a new storyline to pursue, as well as new enemies, new items, and much more. Make no mistake: this is a serious endeavor, so you should go into it prepared to play what is essentially an entirely new&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>. The GOG page also contains instructions for how to install the mod on Steam, but they can be a bit involved, so make sure you set aside a little time if you're planning to play on Valve's platform.</p>

It’s not the most intuitive or groundbreaking horror game to strike fear in our hearts, but it provides a consuming atmosphere that brings the film universe to life.

Does it overlap? Do you need to have seen the movies to enjoy the game, or does the game spoil the movies? Here is how <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> fits into the movie universe!</p><h2 id="h3587"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s <em>A Quiet Place </em>all about?</strong></h2><p>The original <em>A Quiet Place</em>, directed by John Krasinski (<em>The Office</em>), showcases a world in which blind extraterrestrial creatures—Death Angels—crashland via meteors all across the globe. Seemingly within days, they’ve spread across the planet, even into the countryside, and hunt anyone or anything making too much noise.</p><p>In the first film, a mother and father work tirelessly to protect their family and homestead while eking out a living at the end of the world. In the second film (also helmed by Krasinki), we follow the same family as they traverse the land, avoiding the extraterrestrials and searching for safety. Finally, the most recent film, <em>A Quiet Place: Day One </em>(this time directed by Michael Sarnoski), is a spin-off prequel of sorts, detailing the earliest days of the alien invasion in New York City.</p><p>As I said, these beings hunt via sound. They have evolved hearing, allowing them to pick up a twig snapping from great distances.

By this point, according to the prequel film’s events, humanity understands its enemy and their weakness—namely water—along with how to skirt around them using sound or a lack thereof.</p><p>Like the first two films, the game is set in upstate New York, a decision made to allow a few flashback segments that correspond with the films’ storylines.</p><h2 id="h3589"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need to have seen the <em>A Quiet Place</em> movies to enjoy this game?</strong></h2><p>Not at all, surprisingly. <em>Kotaku</em>’s own Zack Zwiezen hadn’t watched any of the films, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-road-ahead-review-is-it-good-scary-1851678522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-road-ahead-review-is-it-good-scary-1851678522">had a thoroughly good time with the game</a></span>.

You’re golden if you ensure the latter is quieter than the former. You can walk up to a Death Angel, crouch, and completely melt into the environment. It’s a little too easy in spots, and the game’s overall difficulty spikes feel artificial, but the tension and immersion are second to none!<br></p><p>Before diving into <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> yourself, you should know that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-long-road-mic-hear-you-scream-ps5-1851669208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-long-road-mic-hear-you-scream-ps5-1851669208">a setting allows the creature to hear your mic in-game</a></span>.

The multiplayer action-RPG continues to look <em>very</em> good (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107">you can find our hands-on impressions here</a></span>). </p><p>The good news is that fans won’t have to wait until <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ February 28, 2025 release date to get their hands on it and check out its world for themselves. An open beta test free to all players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC kicks off on Halloween and runs into early November. There are three segments to it, including a character creator (with characters transferable to the main game), opening story missions, and a free-roaming Doshaguma Hunt. Here’s the full schedule:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>PlayStation 5 PlayStation Plus Early Access: </strong>October 28 at 8:00pm PT – October 30 at 7:59pm PT</li><li><strong>Non-PlayStation Plus Subscribers: </strong>October 31 at 8:00pm PT – November 3 at 6:59pm PT</li><li><strong>Xbox Series X|S: </strong>October 31 at 8:00pm PT – November 3 at 6:59pm PT</li><li><strong>Steam: </strong>October 31 at 8:00pm PT – November 3 at 6:59pm PT</li></ul></blockquote><p>You’ll notice that PS5 players who subscribe to PS Plus get a three-day head start while everyone else has to wait until October 31. Also worth noting is that PS Plus and Xbox Live, now part of Game Pass Core/Ultimate, aren’t required to play the online beta. The test also features cross-play, so you can meet up with your friends even if they’re on a different platform. Everyone who participates gets a pendant and item pack that can be used in the final game. </p><p>Capcom’s partnership with Sony for the game runs a little deeper than early beta access, however. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-launches-on-ps5-next-week/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-launches-on-ps5-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over at the PlayStation Blog</a></span>, the company highlighted DualSense-specific features for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>including Tempest 3D audio support as well as integration of the integrated speaker, adaptive triggers, and the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, which can be used to aim long-range weapons and abilities. Hopefully, there’s an option to turn all of those features off, or at least the integrated speaker.

            <p>The Day Before developer Fntastic has called it a day on the Kickstarter it hoped would secure funding for Escape Factory, a physics-based multiplayer co-op escape game.</p>
<p>In a post shared on social media platform X, the studio said the project had not "generated enough interest" and was "unlikely" to reach the goal initially set out. As such, Fntastic has decided to postpone work on Escape Factory and cancel the Kickstarter. No funds have been collected, it said. </p>
<p>But, don't go thinking the developer is actually going to call it a day. Rather, in announcing the end of one game, it has also announced the start of another one: an "action-horror prop hunt" game called Items.</p>

<p>Yes, in that very same post where Fntastic admitted there simply isn't enough interest in its Factory game, it said the community had been asking for a prop hunt game, so that is what it is going to do now.</p><p>Fntastic added the development of Items will "require significant resources", and therefore the team has "decided to release mobile games in parallel to support the process". It also suggested another Kickstarter could be on the cards further down the line, stating it is "important to us that our players get the chance to play and test the game in advance" of a release.</p>
<p>In response to one less than convinced social media follower who scoffed at the developer's ongoing attempt to win back some favour, Fntastic said: "We know our decisions and projects might not be for everyone, but we’re working hard to create a game that our supporters will like and enjoy."</p>

<p>It is fair to say that Fntastic does not have a good track record when it comes to releasing games. It finally launched The Day Before back in December last year, after a rocky road to release which included delays, the developer being forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-dev-insists-zombie-mmo-is-not-a-scam-following-latest-delay">state its game wasn't a scam</a>, and criticism for its use of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delayed-steam-pre-order-hit-the-day-before-developer-defends-use-of-unpaid-volunteers">unpaid volunteers</a>. It even got tied up in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/calendar-app-company-confirms-the-day-before-trademark-dispute">bizarre trademark dispute with a calendar app</a> also called The Day Before.</p><p>However, in the end, The Day Before didn't last long. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-befores-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-seem-deserved">Its debut was a mess</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-fntastic-suddenly-announces-its-shut-down">studio shut down a mere matter of days after the game's release</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-publisher-apologises-for-game-as-steam-refunds-open">players' receiving refunds for the product</a>. Fantastic announced its 'comeback' last month, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-returns-with-fntastic-20-and-is-asking-for-your-money-again">attempt to refresh itself with a 'Fntastic 2.0' push</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> is a worthwhile upgrade, being a robust remaster that greatly enhances the original game's visuals while introducing options seen in its sequel, according to a new tech review.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review-the-upgrades-are-worthwhile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the remaster of the first entry in the series by Guerrilla, developed primarily by Nixxes, highlighting how the many improvements included in the game made it a worthwhile upgrade over the original. Like Forbidden West, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered features three performance options - 30, 40, and 60 FPS - which balance visual quality and resolution to achieve the target framerate. All three modes use dynamic resolution scaling, with quality mode aiming for native 4K resolution and the other modes below 1800p. All three modes are roughly the same, and image quality in performance mode is good enough to make it the recommended display mode for most players. In addition, all three display modes hit their target performance perfectly.</p>
<p>While the new display modes are welcome, it's the visual changes that make Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered a worthwhile upgrade, according to Digital Foundry. Almost every aspect of the game has been tweaked and improved, from the terrain system and foliage to the detail of man made areas, water rendering, which is not as good as in the sequel but definitely improved over the original, lighting, character models, and animations, especially in dialogue sequence. Audio was also improved, with a new mix featuring better surround and 3D audio support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exclusive: Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - PS5 DF Tech Review - Is The Upgrade Worthwhile?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNkC2BOaboM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches on October 31st on PC and PlayStation 5. The remaster will be available for only $10 to owners of the original release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has announced that it's skipping an Early Access phase for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>and going straight to a full release thanks to the staggering sum of money the game has raised via Kickstarter.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeEvershine/status/1848934908787576843">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Pathea reveals that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>'s hugely successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crowdfunding campaign</a>, which was fully funded <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded">less than an hour after its launch</a>, has hit the $2.5 million milestone. Not bad, considering its initial goal was a humble $200,000.</p>
<p>As a result of that milestone being reached,&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will skip Early Access, and two pairs of "non-core characters" will now have optional Rival Romances to pursue. That's in addition to already-hit stretch goals like body customization, expanded wardrobe options, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-early-access-skip-gliding.jpg?itok=h5rHjrF1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-early-access-skip-gliding.jpg?itok=bG4FDitB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>has been a runaway Kickstarter success.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the $2.5m milestone has been reached, it now remains to be seen whether further stretch goals will be hit. At $2.75m, Pathea will add a new core romanceable NPC with the opposite gender to the $1.7m stretch goal's bachelor or bachelorette.</p>
<p>$3m in funding means that you'll get to build your own zoo, which can then be visited by tourists to give you some extra income. Five additional sidequests will also be added if this funding goal is reached.</p>
<p>Finally, Pathea says that if it reaches $10m funding, it'll create a full remake of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s art style and quality-of-life improvements. It's unlikely the game will reach this goal, but hey, there's still a day or so to go!</p>

<p>This announcement means that&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>will become the first game in its series not to launch in Early Access, since both of the game's predecessors,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-portia">Portia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock"><em>Sandrock</em></a>, did so.</p>
<p>Right now,&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date, but when it does arrive, it'll be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 might be more than a decade old, but it’s still a powerhouse of game, particularly where content creation is concerned. It might just be a year until Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally released, and that anticipation is driving more people to GTA 5. In a recent report published by Streams Charts, it was revealed that GTA 5 is <strong>still </strong>the world’s most popular game to watch on stream.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers-always">Big Numbers, Always</h2>



<p>In a report highlighting streaming performance through Q3 2024, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/most-watched-games-livestreaming-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steams Charts revealed</a> that GTA 5 secured a whopping 533.3 <strong>million </strong>hours watched. It was the most popular game on Twitch but also across other sites such as Nimo and Kick. It would have been the most popular game on YouTube, but it was edged out by ML:BB and the recent MPL esports event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What makes this achievement more remarkable is that almost every other title in the top ten is only popular because of an esports event. From the League of Legends World Championship to IEM Rio, some of the biggest esports events in the world have taken place in the last quarter or are still unfolding, bolstering these numbers immeasurably.</p>



<p>GTA 5 (obviously) doesn’t have an esports scene – it’s just pure, unadulterated entertainment. It helps that the GTA RP scene has been running wild for years, and that’s the biggest draw to this platform.</p>



<p>It was also revealed by Streams Charts that in the last quarter, Black Myth: Wukong was <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/black-myth-wukong-has-taken-crown-most-popular-game-release-live-streaming-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the most popular new game</a> in terms of streaming. It secured a massive 39.3 million watch hours, while the second-place game, EA Sports FC 25, netted just 14.7 million watch hours.</p>

<p>Having the best AK-74 loadout attachments for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> will give you the best chance of victory with the Assault Rifle. The iconic gun returns to the franchise, joining the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BO6 arsenal</a> as one of the most powerful weapons in its category. </p>



<p>With incredible damage and fairly easy-to-control recoil, the AK-74 dominates the mid-range, and can even best opponents at longer lines of sight too. Here’s all the information you need to build the best Black Ops 6 AK-74 loadout, including the optimal attachments, Perks, Equipment, and more.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-ak-74-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ak-74">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-ak-74">Best Secondary for AK-74</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AK-74 in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-ak-74-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AK-74 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-ak-74-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AK-74 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong>&nbsp;Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong>&nbsp;Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong>&nbsp;Rapid Fire</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;CQB Grip</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want the best attachments possible to get the most out of the AK-74 in Black Ops 6. The <strong>Volzhskiy Reflex </strong>is a clean Optic to replace the bulky iron sights, while the <strong>Suppressor </strong>will allow you to shoot freely and not worry about popping up on the enemy radar. </p>



<p>The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> extends the AK-74’s damage range, allowing you to take on enemies at longer distances, while the combination of <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> and the <strong>Extended Mag I </strong>attachments increases the AR’s TTK.</p>



<p>Lastly, to take full advantage of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-global-systems-key-innovations-announcement#omnimovement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Omnimovement</a>, you’ll want to use the <strong>CQB Grip</strong>, which improves the AK-74’s sprint-to-fire, slide-to-fire, and dive-to-fire speed.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ak-74">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AK-74</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ve chosen Perks that help you stay mobile and undetected while using the AK-74 in Black Ops 6. <strong>Ghost </strong>will keep you off enemy radars, while <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> lets you reload and use equipment while sprinting. <strong>Bankroll </strong>gives you a boost in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a> and the <strong>Perk Greed Wildcard</strong> allows you to choose a fourth Perk, so <strong>Dexertity </strong>fills the final spot to further boost movement.</p>



<p>Having three red Perks means you get the <strong>Enforcer Combat Specialty</strong>, which provides a&nbsp;temporary movement speed and health regen buff after getting a kill.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, you can’t go wrong with a <strong>Frag Grenade</strong>, especially if you like to cook and throw them at just the right time for an easy kill. The <strong>Stim Shot</strong> is an essential Tactical for me, as the ability to regen health quickly and get back in the fight is vital for playing aggressively. </p>



<p>Lastly, the<strong> Trophy System </strong>is a great Field Upgrade choice for objective-based game modes, allowing you and your team to stay on the point without the need to avoid enemy Equipment.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-ak-74">Best Secondary for AK-74</h2>



<p>Any Pistol will serve you well as a Secondary weapon for the AK-74. Without Overkill, Pistols are the best Secondary option for finishing off a kill when you need to reload or you run out of ammo. </p>



<p>Launchers are great for taking out Scorestreaks and enemies in powerful positions, but they’re not as reliable in terms of being a backup option.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AK-74 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the AK-74 in Black Ops 6 by <strong>reaching Level 10</strong>. This shouldn’t take too long, and you can check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to level up quickly</a> if you’re eager to start using the AK-74.</p>



<p>Further, progression is universal across Black Ops 6’s modes, so you can even enjoy some Zombies to level up and unlock the AK-74 and use it in the multiplayer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-ak-74-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AK-74 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, the AK-74 is a meta option in Black Ops 6. It’s one of my favorite weapons to use due to its sheer damage output and heavy-hitting feel. The Assault Rifle excels in medium to long-ranged engagements, and it holds its own in close-quarters combat too. </p>



<p>It packs a mean punch, with consistent damage and fairly easy-to-control recoil. It’s easily one of the most effective Assault Rifles in the game, and with the attachments in our best loadout for the Assault Rifle, you’ll be able to come out on top in any gunfight in BO6.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the AK-74 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to use an alternative to the AK-74, the <strong>XM4 </strong>is a strong option, especially since it’s immediately available for players to use once they unlock Custom Loadouts at Level 4. If you want to move away from Assault Rifles, give the <strong>KSV </strong>SMG a go, as it has similarities to the AK-74 but its stats are tuned for medium and close-quarters combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-team-crunched-30-ps5-dev-kits-each-night-to-check-remasters-lighting-effects<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek has shed more light on how the team got <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered ready for release.</p>
<p>Notably, this included hooking up more than 30 PlayStation 5 developer kits - special versions of Sony's console designed for use by developers - to explore the game's large open-world map each evening, in order to make sure everything looked right.</p>
<p>The detail comes from a conversation between van Beek and a Horizon fan on social media platform X, after the latter shared an impressively-brightened screenshot from the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster, alongside a noticeably duller image from the original as a comparison. </p>

</figure>
<p>Aloy's first outing was Guerrilla Games' first open-world game - something which took some time for the studio's lighting team to manage, as it "featured locations over a 30+ square kilometre area in a 24-hour light cycle".</p>
<p>The scale of the project meant it was "extremely hard" for the Guerrilla to "check every nook and cranny of the world to see if the lighting functioned correctly", Van Beek wrote. Indeed, the images posted by the fan showed an area in the original game where Guerrilla's lighting solutions had "malfunctioned" - which is why the difference when compared with the game's remake was so striking.</p>
<p>When further asked if Guerrilla now has a system in place to check the entirety of Horizon Zero Dawn's world, van Beek confirmed that the studio now uses something called Autobot.</p>
<p>"It boots the game and makes a series of screenshots in thousands of locations at multiple times of day," the developer explained. "It does this each night, it's used 30+ PlayStation dev kits, but checking the results is still a human effort."</p>
<p>So, does this mean that any of those locations in the original Horizon Zero Dawn that, in van Beek's words, malfunction will now be sorted? "We can only hope," the studio lead closed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">remastered version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> will be released on 31st October, across PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>For more, our friends over at Digital Foundry just took a look at the spruced up game, concluding "yes, the upgrades are worthwhile" in their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review-the-upgrades-are-worthwhile">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered tech review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test will be held next week on all platforms, complete with cross-platform play support.</p>
<p>During today's&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/KxYKTXuoxXQ?si=WBxlxRBCByYHy_0b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Showcase</a>, it was confirmed that players on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S will be able to try out the game from October 31st at 8:00 pm until November 3rd at 6:59 pm PT. PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to access the open beta a few days earlier, from October 28th at 8:00 pm to October 30th at 7:59 pm PT. The beta test will include Character Creation to create characters that can be transferred into the final version of the game, a Story Trial, which will grant players to play through the game's first few sequences, and a Doshaguma hunt where players will have to take out an Alpha Doshaguma and also be able to try out multiplayer.</p>
<p>During today's Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, a new trailer was also shared, showcasing the Oilwell Basin location and the Rompopolo and Ajarakan monsters. You can check out the trailer and the entirety of today's showcase below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase | 2024.10.23" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxYKTXuoxXQ?start=549&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from the description of the included content, the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta will feature the same content featured in the Gamescom beta. If so, hunters will be in for a threat, as it was a great showcase of some of the game's new features and mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th, 2025.</p>

The Cursed expedition event runs for the next two weeks and features new bosses, new gear, a flying saucer, and a UFO players can make their own.</p><p>As with every new <em>NMS</em> event, the developers at Hello Games are changing up how the game works. The Cursed takes place in a new universe where the line between life and... unlife?? is perilously thin. The exosuit, which normally protects players from the harsh environs of space and alien planets, now comes with an “anomaly suppressor” that’ll keep them stable as reality shifts around them. Additionally, players won’t be able to warp between star systems, having to instead travel via a portal system (kinda like how guild navigators ferry everyone about in <em>Dune</em> — minus the all psychoactive drug use). </p><p>Speaking of celebrated figures in sci-fi, The Cursed also includes a new hub deemed the Boundary StarShip which according to the blog post takes its artistic inspiration from the works of H.R. Giger. Expect plenty of tubes, fleshy ridges, and <em>wet </em>stuff. The Cursed expedition starts today and lasts for the next two weeks. But if spooky stuff isn’t your jam, Hello Games is also planing something special that’s focused on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">pending launch of the PS5 Pro.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developers Dreamlit have piped over fresh footage of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> ecotribal extravaganza <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/towers-of-aghasba">Towers Of Aghasba</a>. It's an abbreviated but generous display of equatorial exotica and vaguely prehistoric wildlife, home to such key verbs as "exploration", "village-building", "gardening", "creature-nurturing" and "murdering megasloths with a lump of wood". And look at that, there's a release date perched on top - 19th November 2024.

Kaan <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/towers-of-aghasba-has-all-the-settlement-building-and-flying-whales-you-could-hope-for">liked this one</a> when he saw it at last May's PlayStation showcase. I am quite interested myself, but being an older and more jaded soul, I also suspect a certain hollowness. The premise here is that you're a junior architect of the Shimu tribe, on a mission to restore a landscape racked by the forces of the Withered. To do this, you will mingle with local gods, rebuild villages and plant enormous trees that greenify the surrounding earth and attract various fantasy animals. 
</p>
<p>
These you can kill for their craftable wibbly bits, or nurture for more lasting benefits and because you don't want to slaughter the nice floofy pastel dragon that's just ambled into your jungle. If you find such eco-positivity irksome, or you outright despise pastel colours and floof, you can always run off to areas where the Withered still hold sway.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Withered look like giant undead tree people. Their dominions are wrapped in swirling layers of monochrome fog - I'm reminded of Ghost Of Tsushima's Kurosawa Mode. Combat is real-time and seems to be a familiar mix of combos, archery and dodge-rolling. There's a crafting system for weapons, armour and elixirs, but it doesn't appear to be the focus. If you need reinforcements, there's co-op support. Also, you get a hang-glider like the one in Zelda. Don't tell Link. I'm sure he has plenty of spares.
</p>
<p>
Things I like: the sheer abundance of vegetation and critters in flourishing areas, and the accompanying emphasis on understanding the animals and their habits, which makes me think of Subnautica. I am looking forward to lurking under some fronds and rubbing my thighs while the floofy pastel dragon sniffs dubiously at the berries I've just left out for it. I wonder if the game's ecosystem simulation stretches to cases of food poisoning?</p>
<p>I also like the organicity and tuber-like appearance of the buildings, though the game's heady Tribal Themes do feel like they've been cartoonishly lifted from indigenous cultures without sufficient reflection.</p>
<p>It's a shame they've gone with a building system based on holographic templates - I understand that this is more user-friendly and no, I have no idea how I'd construct a wattle and daub house without holographic templates, but the downside of a world of organic shapes is that any outright computery elements really <em>clang</em>. "Your creativity will be both challenged and rewarded," gushes the trailer narrator, as the on-screen character waves a hammer and conjures an entire ornamental flowerbed into existence.
</p><p>
You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178070/Towers_of_Aghasba/">the Steam page</a>. I'm keen to give it a play, but I do wonder if Towers Of Aghasba will ultimately prove to be just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game with some superficial eco-theming. I want to see at least five minutes of uninterrupted play before I join Kaan aboard the giddy hang-glider of anticipation.

A new line of boards dedicated to some of the powerful “pseudo legendary” Pokémon has just been released, and if you want them, you might want to jump on them pretty quick, as one of them has already sold out.<br></p><p>The four new boards cost $299.99 on the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Center</a></span> website, and feature gorgeous art of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12815/pokemon-center-bear-walker-garchomp-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12815/pokemon-center-bear-walker-garchomp-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garchomp</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12816/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragonite-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12816/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragonite-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonite</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12814/pokemon-center-bear-walker-tyranitar-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12814/pokemon-center-bear-walker-tyranitar-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyranitar</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12813/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragapult-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12813/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragapult-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragapult</a></span>. They’re slightly more expensive than the average <em>Pokémon </em>X Bear Walker board, likely because the Pokémon art is in full color compared to the more minimalist coloring of previous boards. I have the Pikachu one on my wall right now and can attest to their quality. So if you’re a Garchomp, Tyranitar, or Dragapult fan, I recommend these boards. If you’re a Dragonite fan, however, you’ll have to find it elsewhere, as it appears to have sold out already.</p><p>Annoyingly enough, the Dragonite boards are showing up on sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dragonite+bear+walker&amp;_sacat=0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dragonite+bear+walker&amp;_sacat=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a></span> with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">scalpers asking for more than twice the original price</a></span>.

This feature is designed to make the game more accessible for newcomers. Plus, crossplay will be active during the test!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/disc-editions-make-up-82-of-all-ps5-console-sales/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Disc editions of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) make up a majority of its console sales in the United States. </p>



<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l76mhopwoy27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, 82% of the lifetime sales of the PS5 are those with a disc drive. That puts digital-only consoles at just 18% of the total sales.</p>







<p>Sony has made a push in recent years for players to move to the digital-only version of its system. Not only does the company charge less for the digital-only PS5, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PS5 Pro</a> only comes in a digital version. In order to play discs, you’ll have to buy a disc drive separately, adding more to your cost.</p>



<p>That said, it appears that, so far at least, players are ok with spending a little extra for the option to play physical media on their console. And while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital-only future seems likely</a> for games, it doesn’t look like gamers are ready to fully go that route yet,</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-fc-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-september-2024/">EA Sports FC 25 Was The Best-Selling Game In US For September 2024</a></h6>



<p>For what it’s worth, September 2024 saw digital PS5 sales make up 40% of new sales for the month. </p>



<p>On the Xbox side of things, the Xbox Series X just surpassed the Xbox Series S in terms of total unit sales. As of September 2024, the Series X has a slim 51% majority over the cheaper Series S in the US.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PS5 sales being mostly consoles with disc drives? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

It ditches Fallout’s traditional United States setting for a post-apocalyptic London packed with famous British landmarks and references. It even secured the likes of Baldur's Gate 3's Neil Newbon for its voice cast, with former UK Speaker of the House John Bercow in the game, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-review-mod">Fallout: London review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Fallout London is a massive mod that makes good use of its untapped setting, with an impressive scope and some great stories – you'll just have to be prepared for technical issues and occasionally obtuse design choices along the way.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod was originally due to arrive on April 23, 2024 but actual Fallout developer Bethesda announced a surprise update for Fallout 4, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-creators-forced-to-delay-hotly-anticipated-mod-out-of-fear-fallout-4s-next-gen-update-will-break-it"><u>which the mod developer feared would impact Fallout: London’s release</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team FOLON lead project manager Dean Carter later lamented how Bethesda, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-fallout-london-modders-jobs"><u>which had made clear it was aware of Fallout: London</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-next-gen-update-left-fallout-london-dev-feeling-blindsided"><u>failed to inform Team FOLON of its plans</u></a>. "That has, for lack of a better term, sort of screwed us over, somewhat,” Carter said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: London eventually launched in July in partnership with GOG, which made the announcement today, October 23 - aka Fallout Day (October 23 is the day the bombs first fell in fallout lore).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today, we couldn’t be happier to see the success that Fallout: London has become – reaching the entirety of one million owners on our platform, and achieving it on Fallout Day no less,” GOG said. “We’d like to take this moment to wholeheartedly congratulate Team FOLON on their groundbreaking record!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement posted on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1298631956438712330" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: London Discord</a>, the mod team added: “You’ve made this journey unforgettable. We’re blown away by your support, and we can’t wait to share what’s next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll keep calm and carry on fixing those bugs, and we'll see you at our next milestone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Stay safe, and remember. Mind the gap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout: London announcement comes ahead of an official Fallout Day broadcast from Bethesda, which promises to reveal more of what’s to come with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time in the world of Fallout, of course, which was boosted by the smash hit Prime Video <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a>. Bethesda continues to update Fallout 76, and plans for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a> at some point in the future, perhaps when it’s done with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In June, Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success">he wasn’t interested in rushing a new Fallout game out the door</a>, just because Fallout is hot right now. Could Fallout eventually leave the United States for a setting on foreign soil? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">No chance, Howard has said</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While fans wait they have mod projects such as Fallout: London to get stuck into, and there’s always Fallout 76 and the existing Fallout games available to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The core game development team, based at Ubisoft Montpellier, allegedly pushed for a sequel or at least more expansions beyond the single Mask of Darkness expansion, but Ubisoft needed help on other projects that had better sales potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a>, most of the people behind the one million-selling Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have moved on to the eternally in-development Beyond Good and Evil 2, but others have been sent to help out on the next mainline Ghost Recon and about a dozen are now working on an unannounced Rayman remake in development at Mario + Rabbids maker Ubisoft Milan.

Ancel is reportedly working on the remake as a consultant, which, Insider Gaming reports, has ruffled feathers inside Ubisoft. Ancel was the subject of an internal investigation in 2020 after he was accused of behavior that led to difficult working conditions for the staff on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Ancel subsequently refuted the allegations and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-says-hes-quit-video-games-to-open-a-wildlife-sanctuary">announced plans to quit the world of video games to open a wildlife sanctuary</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/gettyimages-1227128375-1729688028482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Michel Ancel promoting Rayman in 2011.

This terrain is known to erupt into raging flames during a period of Inclemency known as the Firespring. The newly revealed Brute Wyvern Rompopolo prowls within areas blanketed in a deep oil silt. This fearsome predator expels a toxic gas from its tongue to weaken its prey before using its tail to inject gas into the tar blanketing the ground causing bubbling eruptions. Rompopolo often finds itself battling for territory against roaming Ajarakan, another previously unseen monster that calls this region home. This red-hot Fanged Beast rubs its thick shell to cover itself in a sweltering armor. Amidst this incredibly harsh, ever-changing environment, the skilled craftsman village of Azuz grew around a massive central forge. While the local artisans and fearsome wildlife struggle to survive, a mysterious monster known to locals as the “Black Flame” lurks deep beneath the basin.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_923205"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
