			<p>If you're getting stuck into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard and want to know who you can romance ahead of time, this guide will tell you everything you need to know. In total, there are six characters you can romance, and a lot of the time, being able to bump up your relationship with them involves completing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/">certain quests</a>, picking specific dialog options, and the like. It functions the same way it does in most games, where you can romance a companion. This guide will tell you about each character you can romance and some of the best ways to win their favor.</p>
<h2>All Romance Options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As stated above, there are&nbsp;<strong>six characters</strong> that you can romance. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harding</li>
<li>Neve</li>
<li>Bellara</li>
<li>Davrin</li>
<li>Emmrich</li>
<li>Taash</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to romance the characters, you'll want to make sure that you are checking the&nbsp;<strong>Lighthouse</strong> frequently. This is a hub that shows which characters you can interact with, and this will give you an opportunity to have conversations with them, which can also lead to progress in your bond with them. As you progress your relationship with the companion, you'll also be given the option to take on their personal quests. If you complete them, it also has the option to provide additional context and conversations where you are able to flirt with them.</p>
<p>Should you be undecided on who to romance, you are given the option to flirt with all of the companions for a time until you reach a point in a relationship with one of them where they ask for commitment. Then, it's up to you to decide your next move.</p>
<p>In addition to having conversations with the companions, completing any quest will boost your relationship with the companions that are in your party. If you're trying to romance someone specific, it's generally recommended that you keep them in your party throughout the game to be able to boost their relationship as you go. While quests provide approval boosts with your companions, completing faction-specific quests can also grant approval boosts to the companions in those specific factions.</p>
<p>As an example, if you're fighting off Venatori enemies in Dock Town, this will increase your relationship with Neve but will not increase your relationship with the other companions available.</p>
<p>It's also possible for specific companions to romance each other. It's uncertain at the moment whether it's based on who you pick or if it's just guaranteed to end up that way, but there is the possibility of seeing some of your friends romance each other.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about all of the romance options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Who will you be romancing first?</p>

			<p>Two days ago, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the closure of two PlayStation Studios: Firewalk, maker of Concord (reported to have cost over $200 million and <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> mere days after its launch), and Neon Koi, which would have attempted to bring some of Sony's prized IPs to mobile.</p>
<p>Now, the CWA (Communications Workers of America) has released a rather scathing statement accusing Sony of furthering its gaming monopoly with the layoffs. They also plan to share their concerns with antitrust regulators. Here's the relevant excerpt from the statement:</p>
<p><em>This devastating news comes on the heels of record layoffs across the video game industry. These decisions by highly insulated video game CEOs are creating perilous working conditions for video game workers by eliminating their job stability. Last month, former Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President Chris Deering suggested that laid-off game workers should “go to the beach for a year,” further demonstrating the lack of respect executives have for their workforce amid layoffs.</em></p>
<p><em>Alongside these layoffs, Sony’s decision to dissolve studios outside their walled garden of PlayStation-exclusive content rather than making games that have to compete in the highly diverse and competitive mobile game market should be a cautionary warning sign of Sony’s interest in furthering its monopoly position in the video game industry. CWA plans to raise the anti-competitive impacts of Sony’s increasing monopoly and monopsony power with the appropriate antitrust regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders.</em></p>
<p>The CWA previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a labor neutrality agreement with Microsoft and favorably <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-x-microsoft-deal-backed-by-cwa-in-ftc-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hailed</a> the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (which, however, came with its own heavy cost in layoffs).</p>
<p>Sony is about to launch a new console, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, on the market. We've recently interviewed two game developers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Five</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexon</a>) to hear their impressions on the hardware.</p>
<p>Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Hideaki Nishino, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment's Studio Business Group. In the conversation, Nishino discussed Sony's vision for the PS5 Pro:</p>
<p><em>We have done Pro in the last generation. We learned a lot from there. When we were selling PS4 Pro, in addition to the PS4, 20% of customers actually got the PS4 Pro. It was high-end, premium tier. There are potential users acquiring those kind of units. Interestingly enough, it was not just about highly engaged users; actually, new users came to PlayStation to get PS4 Pro as well.</em></p>
<p><em>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launched — it was another five-year project for us. There was a conversation around whether we wanted to do another Pro or not. But the main thing was, there are technologies we can grow up in three years or five years. The innovation and technology advancement is quicker in the modern world. Phones are updating every year, PCs are updating every year. I don’t think we’d go every year updates, but there are things we can package together to bring the greatest things into game console segment range. That’s the vision.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7 for $699/£699/€799.</p>

In addition to being the first entry in the series to launch day one on a subscription service, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is the first to be supported with cloud gaming. There was also no early access period for the single-player campaign, and no exclusive content or perks for PlayStation users.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-more-room-in-hell-2-early-access-review.1024602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/no-more-room-in-hell-2-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes playing No More Room in Hell 2 feels like actually being in hell. One minute, you're approaching a console to start flipping switches with friends, and the next, you're completely stuck – no keyboard inputs work, you can't equip any of your items, and your teammates have to try and lure a zombie over hoping it will put you out of your misery. Issues like this are part of a large pile of problems that could be excused by its Early Access label on Steam; there's only one map released so far, character models are incomplete, and there are plenty more bugs to encounter. But that grace only goes so far. While No More Room in Hell 2 is technically playable, it's not close to actually feeling Early Access-ready. And even if it weren’t riddled with bugs and light on content, it still doesn't have a distinct identity to differentiate it from being yet another co-op survival horror shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No More Room in Hell 2 follows a similar structure to its predecessor's objective-based game mode. Eight players are dropped onto a forest-covered map, and must complete tasks while trying not to get killed by zombie hordes. As is common in survival horror games, you'll have to scavenge for weapons, health items, ammo, and other gear to get a leg up, all of which will be in generally short supply. The first No More Room in Hell took a lot of inspiration from George Romero's Dawn of the Dead with how the zombies (here called "stiffs") function, and that continues to be to its benefit in the sequel: They're slow and shambling, but are huge threats in groups. And the further you get into the map, the more dense the hordes get. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No More Room in Hell 2 Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all pretty standard for a co-op zombie shooter, but No More Room in Hell 2 uses some smart tricks to help you boost both your kit and your team. You'll spawn randomly at one of eight points around the edges of the sole map, called Power Plant, and work your way towards the middle, completing objectives along the way that'll provide you with all-important gear but also up the difficulty as the hordes get bigger. The map isn't huge, but it's large enough that you might not run into another player until the final area at the center – your teammates don't even show up on your HUD unless you're in a party (in which case you’ll also spawn near them), and you'll only hear them through voice chat if they're physically close enough. That does mean a lot of each round involves going out of your way to team up, but it's an excellent added objective that can make things feel more tense. If you fail, you'll be stuck with some poor loot and nobody to help you up if you go down. It also adds a sense of progression that changes up the map as you go, and a great way to make it feel like your actions are rewarded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the key area where No More Room in Hell 2 excels: fostering cooperation. Sure, I may have been trapped in a horrible glitch that prevented me from evacuating successfully with the rest of my team, but at least I got to watch them try everything they could to free me from my prison. As you all descend on the final area, you're cleverly forced to work together, and you form some temporary camaraderie as a result. If you squint through the egregious bugs — clipping through walls, zombies not dying despite taking damage, guns not dealing damage at all — you can see a game that emphasizes teamwork in smart ways. And despite having just one map, it's the perfect place to watch your crew's story unfold. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The key area where No More Room in Hell 2 excels is fostering cooperation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Power Plant offers plenty of opportunities for grouping up through optional objective locations. Completing them will provide you with loot: guns, bullets, health, and sometimes special items that give passive bonuses. You <em>could </em>potentially make it to the end without stocking up at one of these points, but this is a survival horror game where supplies are scarce, so you will want to get through at least one of these areas. They're also easy to find; you can either navigate towards one with the help of your map and compass, or you'll just stumble upon them. When one of two commanders comes over the radio (one of which is surprisingly voiced by Deux Ex's Elias Toufexis) and tells you that there's a church nearby with supplies or a bar that's been booby trapped, I always wanted to swing on by — and any other player in the vicinity usually did too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gradually, you'll find your teammates at these locations, where you'll have to work together to complete a series of tasks for your reward. Usually that involves things like finding fuses and placing them inside fuse boxes to power up rooms, turning on generators, or connecting wires within wire boxes. Most require basic puzzle solving and timing to complete, but that's infinitely more difficult when you're being hounded by zombies. Additionally, solving these puzzles brings you into a separate menu that you have to exit if you want to fight back. It's times like these where it becomes important to watch your teammate's back. If they can focus on the task at hand, and you somehow defeat all the zombies, you can move onto the next one. There are even tasks that involve having one player read a randomly-generated code to another to unlock a screen or move a process forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time you reach the final objective, everybody still alive will have grouped up naturally. Of course, this is when the difficulty is amped up, all but requiring you to work together and coordinate your moves. It’s a tense finale where you're running around, flipping switches, and entering codes to boot the plant back up — all while trying to avoid the biggest zombie horde yet. You can all split up and handle different parts of this objective, but you will all still be in the same area working toward the same goal, and it's, quite frankly, impossible not to help your teammates at least a little bit since there are so many zombies to kill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of a few tips (save your ammo, jump on cars to get away briefly, etc.), you won't get any in-depth tutorials when you first launch No More Room in Hell 2, and your first round will likely be stressful and confusing as a result – especially if you run into a game-breaking bug. Since there's only one map, it doesn't take long to figure out how to complete the various objectives and where to go to successfully complete a run, but this is also where things get the most repetitive. The first time you encounter some of these locations, like the Lookout Tower or the Ranger's Station, it can be a tense battle to turn on the power, fill up generators, and hit all the correct buttons before getting overrun by zombies or going through all your supplies. After a few rounds, though, you start running through those areas easily. At least, that is until you run into some unwelcome difficulty spikes depending on if you happen to encounter a teammate or have enough gear. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A few areas that feel too large or unnecessary can lead to getting lost.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You also don't need to approach every zombie encounter by making a decision to shoot or not to shoot. The tools you have in your arsenal and how you use them have an impact, too. You're always equipped with a flashlight, but having it on will alert zombies. Using a shotgun can disperse a group, but will quickly alert even larger groups waiting nearby. There are items that can let you control crowds, such as a radio or a deployable lamp, but they're rare and tough to throw down in late-game scenarios where you're completely surrounded by zombies, making them interesting ideas that aren’t very useful in practice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a sort of immersive sim quality to how you complete each No More Room in Hell 2 run. Beyond how you approach combat, you can take multiple routes to different locations – there isn't a lot of variety, but it's enough that you can run in any given direction and most likely find a path forward. The level design is on its way to being excellent, with strategically placed dirt piles or trucks that let you climb over fences and lead you to alternate routes. That said, there are also a few areas that are too large or feel outright unnecessary to begin with that can lead to you getting lost. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also multiple character types you can choose from before starting a run, each with forgettable names and descriptions like "Football MVP" or "Marine Veteran." They all provide distinct but small buffs to things like two-handed melee damage, stamina, or flashlight battery lifespan. You don't get a choice of character on your first run, but after you die, you'll select between three randomly-generated types each time. As long as you don't die, you can continue building these characters up through experience and supplies collected during a run. If you <em>do </em>die, you lose everything, and you’ll still lose progress if you leave a match early to try and avoid death. It incentivizes you to do well and provides an actual end if you die in-game (and come back as a zombie your teammates can kill). That connection would be more impactful, however, if there were more than the small handful of character models that frequently repeated. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Then there are the bugs — so, <em>so </em>many bugs. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's these cut corners that currently pull me out of what could be a game on track for a standout full release one day. Yes, there's a lot of leeway you can give to an Early Access launch, but many of the pieces of No More Room in Hell 2 aren't even <em>close </em>to complete. For all the things I like about the map, there are also paths on it that quite literally lead to nowhere. While there are plenty of objectives scattered around, they're obnoxiously inconsistent in terms of difficulty; Some feel downright insurmountable in small groups, while crossing a bridge after opening its gates — something that should feel like a huge moment — can be completed by simply running forward and occasionally strafing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are the bugs — so, <em>so </em>many bugs. Every Early Access game (and most fully released ones, for that matter) has them, but many here are inexcusable. When I first started playing at launch last week, shotguns didn't always do damage. I was clipping through walls into closed off rooms where I quickly became trapped by zombies, some of which didn't die despite constantly being peppered by bullets. Objective markers wouldn't show up on the HUD, which is kind of a problem when you're a newcomer and don't know where you need to go. Sometimes I'd look at a teammate and they'd just be a floating head. It's a mess.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best games with actual zombies in them</h3><p>These are games with the classic walking undead in them. No Las Plagas here.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To its credit, developer Torn Banner Studios has been working diligently on hotfixes since launch, and has released some very impactful updates over the course of my review period. Shotguns are now more reliable, map markers consistently show up, and I can actually accomplish puzzles without getting stuck or clicking on a switch multiple times before it responds. There is still a long way to go before it reaches an acceptable state, but prioritizing hotfixes instead of working on the planned content roadmap is the right call in the short term, and has already resulted in some huge improvements.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, those content updates are desperately needed, too, and ideally something in them to help it stand out from the pack. It's been eight years since No More Room in Hell 2 was first teased, and over a decade since the original No More Room in Hell was spun off from a Half-Life 2 mod into its own standalone game. While the sequel follows a similar structure to its predecessor, with the same darkness-drenched atmosphere, scarce loot, and relatively weak characters, it doesn't offer the same ethical dilemmas and tension building. Gone are the child zombies that were much faster than the standard ones and left you understandably uncomfortable about killing them, for example. The goal was to build a world that felt like an actual apocalypse, where your choices mattered beyond just survival. In contrast, No More Room in Hell 2 is on its way to presenting a world that feels like it's falling apart around you, but in terms of tone and the underlying story, it's just another standard zombie shooter with a focus on getting rescued at the end.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you pull back the layers of performance issues and bugs, No More Room in Hell 2 has a lot of potential. It plays around with clever ideas about how to get players to work together through some excellent level design, but those concepts aren’t explored enough yet to make it more than just another co-op survival horror shooter with generic guns and scarce loot. No More Room in Hell 2’s Early Access launch at least allows you to team up with friends for a few chaotic and sometimes fun rounds, but with a single available map that gets repetitive fast and a mountain of serious bugs that cause unexpected problems, it needs a lot more time in the oven. With a slew of hotfixes already arriving and more supposedly on the way, hopefully the flames of hell are hot enough to cook it to perfection down the line, but you should probably wait until they do.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Just a week after the launch of Intel's latest generation of desktop CPUs, AMD has fired back with the announcement of the first 3D V-Cache-equipped chip in the company's 9000-series CPUs, with the promise of it being the fastest gaming chip on the market.</p><p>The <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1225/the-gaming-legend-continues-amd-introduces" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> is the latest in a growing line of 3D V-Cache CPUs, with each one proving to be an essential part of an enthusiast-gaming PC. It's the first to feature AMD's 2nd-generation 3D V-Cache technology, with AMD saying that this latest CPU is on average 8% faster than the previous generation's 7800X3D, widely regarded as the best CPU on the market for gaming performance. Perhaps more telling of Intel's recent woes is the fact that AMD states that the 9800X3D is on average 20% faster than the flagship Intel Ultra 9 285K that launched last week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMBqNbHUrs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTMBqNbHUrs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The 9800X3D also increases the base clock speed 4.7 GHz, with a boost of 5.2GHz and a TDP of 120W. All in all, AMD is hoping that this will improve the 9800X3D's productivity performance too, which the series has lacked in the past. It will also be the first X3D chip unlocked for overclocking, letting enthusiasts attempt to squeeze even more out of the silicon with meaningful tweaks.</p><p>The 9800X3D launch is just around the corner, with the chip expected to hit shelves on November 7. This performance comes at a cost, however, with the 9800X3D retailing for $479. That's $30 more than the launch price of the 7800X3D, which can also regularly be found on sale for below $400. Given that both the 7000 series and 9000 series utilize the same motherboard chipset, there's now even more choices if you're in the market for a PC upgrade.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza%E2%80%99s-tv-adaptation-does-the-only-thing-it-can-do.1024581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-tv-adaptation-does-the-only-thing-it-can-do<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I can see the overarching appeal in turning <em>Yakuza</em>: <em>Like A Dragon</em> into a TV series. It's gotten wildly popular in the West in recent years. There are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Dragon_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> previous adaptations to learn from</a>. And at some level it's a reliable ol' story about a place, a man, his heart and his fists.</p><p>If that's all the thought you wanted to put into this show, and that's all you were looking to get out of it, Amazon's confusingly-named <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> will be all you ever needed from it. Making the decision to tweak the game's timeline and backstory to better suit the format, it's a show about a group of friends who grew up in an orphanage together, and are now moving to the big city to make a name for themselves. It jumps constantly between 1995 and 2005, the former scenes looking back on their formative years and arrival in Kamurocho (that big city), the latter a group of very changed people a decade after some shit has clearly gone down.</p><p>As a tale of our hero Kazuma Kiryu becoming the man we know him as today, of soap opera drama and fistfights that sometimes border on the comedic, this is everything a superficial adaptation of <em>Yakuza</em> needed to be. From everyone's wardrobes to the streets of Kamurocho itself, nearly every visual cue from the games has been recreated down to the most minute detail, and it's a joy seeing real people wearing real clothes navigating the fake city's all-too familiar streets.</p><p>Once you get past the fact that no actual man could physically fill that suit, Ryoma Takeuchi does a decent job playing Kiryu, the fight scenes are great and the entirety of the show's <em>Yakuza </em>cast are as slapstick and self-deferential as you'd hope. It's a cool TV show! If you have never played the games and just want to sit down and watch something set in Japan that has underworld intrigue, loads of brutal fights and some explosions, then <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza </em>will absolutely tick all those boxes.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Yakuza - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4tmmzh2PfA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If you <em>have </em>played the games, though--<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and reader, I know you knew this bit was coming</a>--it doesn't take long for the show to feel a little <em>weird</em>. It succeeds as an adaptation if all you cared about was the show tracing over the game's broadest outlines, but it also fails as an adaptation because the games it's trying to adapt simply cannot be converted to TV, at least in this format.</p><p>What the creators of <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza </em>have done is look at this sprawling, tonally inconsistent and downright weird series and selectively plucked out the only part of it that could ever hope to be adapted: the main storyline. From a practical standpoint, that's understandable! But whenever you talk to someone who has played these games and ask them why they love <em>Yakuza</em>, nobody ever says it's for the main story.</p><p>It's<em> Yakuza's</em> bizarre, heart-warming and frequently hilarious sidequests that really prop up the series, taking what would otherwise have been a musty story about gangsters and loyalty and elevating it into the realms of the classically absurd. From giant manbabies <a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-ai-mission-throws-chatgpt-into-the-river-where-it-belongs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to AI-powered phones</a> to running a hostess club to talking to chickens, it's this extra, wild shit that defines the experience, and a limited, linear TV show could never hope to address that madness. It's a miracle the games, even taking their 100+ hour playtimes into account, are able to.</p><p>That duality, the straight-laced sitting alongside (and being frequently punctuated by) the absurd, is what makes <em>Yakuza Yakuza</em>. Kiryu isn't Kiryu if he's not splitting his time between grimly serious dialogue and a batting cage. So seeing him portrayed as he is in this TV series, with <em>only </em>the drama, is like seeing yin without yang, light without shadow. He's only half a man, and this is only half a show.&nbsp;</p><p>I think a longer, serialised thing might have been the better play here. We could have a central storyline running through everything, but if we want to have a whole episode about managing a baseball team in a small coastal town, then we could have that too.</p><p>The half that's there is good! And if you didn't know any better, that's great, enjoy it! But this is a video game website and I'm a <em>Yakuza </em>freak, so of course my thoughts on this adaptation are pegged entirely on the nature of its adaptation, more so than the merits of the show itself. And for me, it's impossible to see the man on screen and not see the giant, unspoken holes in his life as well.&nbsp; You can't be <em>that</em> serious, Kazuma Kiryu, I know we just saw you get some bad news about your personal life, but right afterwards (and off camera) you probably went and raced some little toy cars as a palette cleanser, and that shit looked <em>fun</em>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2.1024554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a trailer showcasing the characters from the Camarilla Court in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. If you've been wanting to get a closer glimpse into the characters from the game, this trailer shows you what you can expect from how the Kindred interact with players and how they move around the streets of Seattle. The characters all have drastically different personalities, with Benny being a stern character with a potty mouth. Tolly is a unique character with a big personality; Safia is forgetful and quaint, while Lou is demanding and ever-present.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - ‘A Betting Man’ Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2cXtEoGx7E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a short trailer just over a minute, the characters all get a brief showcase so you can see them in action, whether it be in combat or conversation with the characters mentioned. This trailer ties in nicely with Dev Diary 15, which was released in August, and discusses the Dialogue Choice system and how you will be able to interact with the different characters in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We have already covered</a> this dev diary,&nbsp;</span>and we trimmed it down into bite-size pieces for you to read through.</span> Although the trailer showcases the characters ever so slightly, it doesn't provide much information about them other than their main traits and tiny glimpses into their interactions with others.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dialogue choice system</a> that The Chinese Room have put in place, it gives you many different options on how you can interact with the characters in front of you and it's mentioned in the dev diary that they wanted to make sure that the choices didn't have any hidden dialogue or choices that may screw over your character unintentionally due to context not being added. This is something that can happen easily in story-based games, as sometimes prompts don't give the entire conversation, or the characters react in a way that seems totally unexpected.</p>
<p>Hopefully, as we get closer to the release date of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, we will get to see more of the Camarilla Court. Additionally, <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-camarilla-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary 16</a> was about the Camarilla Court and provided some additional context which can help you read between the lines from the short trailer that was provided today. The dev diary gives quotes from each of the characters, as well as an in-depth description of who they are and what role they play within the court.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best Horror Games to Play This Halloween]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween.1024551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're looking to get stuck in with the scary season but aren't sure what games to play for <a href="https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/">Halloween</a>, this list compiles some of the best horror games that you can pick up. The list will include both indie games and triple-A for those who prefer a smaller-scale experience. Hold on to your hats, as this list features some of the best scares you can get on the market right now.</p>
<h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Whether you play the original Silent Hill 2 or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> that was recently released, you're in for a good time. The Remake did a great job of keeping it authentic and much like the original, but added in some extra scares and puzzles to keep the game fresh. For the best experience, you'll want to play this game with headphones, as Bloober Team knocked the sound design out of the park. From Mary's little gasps to the possible chance of hearing whispering from the original, you're not going to want to miss out on all the easter eggs they've included in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>
<h2>Outlast</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/Outlast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outlast</a> is one of the classic horror games that most people play or try to play when diving into the horror genre. If you haven't played it already, you're missing out. Having to explore an abandoned asylum where the lights don't seem to work very often adds to the atmosphere. Combine that with having to use your video camera to be able to navigate and see your surroundings; it can get pretty intense.</p>
<p>Be warned, there is a ton of nudity and a lot of gore, so it may not be the horror game for you if you're the squeamish type.</p>
<h2>Crow Country</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996010/Crow_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crow Country</a> was released earlier this year and took the gaming world by storm. This was the perfect game to bridge the gap while waiting for the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as it takes place in a theme park, much like some of Silent Hill 3. It also features amazing PS1-style graphics, which are perfect for those who are looking for a hit of nostalgia in their horror. The style of the game is great for those who want to feel on edge and have a little bit of fear running through their veins but don't want to experience the realistic jumpscares that are found in more modernized horror games.</p>
<h2>Phasmophobia</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for an all-around comedic time with some friends, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phasmophobia</a> is the way to go. Of course, just because you're with friends doesn't at all mean you're safe, and you may find yourself getting jumpscared a fair few times. The game is quite goofy and is a lot of silly fun, but sometimes the silence is so thick it puts you on edge, especially if you're hunting ghosts by yourself. Make sure not to get killed by the ghost, and everything will turn out fine. Luckily, Phasmophobia just came out on console, so you can now play with your friends on PlayStation and Xbox if you're on PC!</p>
<h2>Alan Wake 2</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's pretty recommended to play the original Alan Wake games before jumping into <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, but you're in for a wild ride when you do get around to it. Not only are the graphics absolutely stunning, but there are more scares than ever. If you're a fan of survival horror, Alan Wake 2 is a great game to get stuck into. On top of that, it's perfect for those who love a twisty story, as there is certainly plenty of that.</p>
<p>The Lake House DLC just came out for Alan Wake 2 as well, so it's a perfect time to get stuck into the game with all of the DLC available. It will also get you excited for the upcoming title, Control 2. You can't go wrong with any of the Remedy Entertainment games, but Alan Wake 2 is certainly one you don't want to miss out on.</p>
<h2>Dead by Daylight</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is another perfect game to play with friends or family. Whether you're the killer and you're hunting them down, or you choose to survive along with your friends (or strangers), there's plenty of fun to be had. You're likely to spend the entire time on edge while trying to fix generators, only for the adrenaline to really get pumping if you miss a skill check on the generator.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are many iconic killers that you can find yourself running away from, including the beloved Xenomorph, Pyramid Head, and even Michael Myers. Dead by Daylight is highly accessible, too, as it's on every platform and is cross-play, allowing you to play with your friends who may be on a console while you're on PC.</p>
<h2>Alien: Isolation</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Isolation</a> is one of the most iconic horror games from modern-day gaming. First released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the graphics were really ahead of its time. Even now, the game looks absolutely phenomenal, and you will be on edge as you explore the ship. There are plenty of moments for a false sense of security, and the Xenomorphs aren't the only thing you have to worry about on the ship with you.</p>
<h2>Still Wakes The Deep</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes The Deep</a> is one of the more recent horror games to be released, and it certainly lived up to its name this year. If you're looking for a Halloween horror, this stunning and horrifying game is perfect for you. Taking place on an oil rig, you have to try and survive while dealing with the otherworldly creature to try and save yourself and your crew mates from certain death. If you have a fear of the ocean or deep sea creatures, you may want to avoid this one.</p>
<h2>Mouthwashing</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mouthwashing</a> is a recent release and is the perfect game to play for Halloween if you're looking for a game that is tense and confusing and has that PS1 surrealist vibe to it. It will leave you on edge and also feeling very confused about what's going on as you slowly uncover the story of the crewmates on the spaceship named Tulpar. The crew mates descend into madness, and you aren't far behind.</p>
<h2>Visage</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for a game that has a P.T. feel to it,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594330/Visage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Visage</a> is the perfect game. Not only are there episodic stories for you to work through, but there are also puzzles and great sound design that will torment you long after you've completed the game. Visage is quite jumpscare-heavy at times and tackles a lot of difficult themes, but it is absolutely worth playing if you've got the time this Halloween.</p>
<h2>Little Nightmares</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/424840/Little_Nightmares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares</a> is the perfect horror game for those who are a bit sensitive to jumpscares and other elements you'd typically find in horror. It's scary without their heavy jumpscares and relies on great character design, storytelling, and puzzle-solving to keep you on edge. Little Nightmares also has some great DLC to accompany it, as well as a sequel if you find that you have enjoyed what's on offer from this title.</p>
<h2>Resident Evil 7</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While a lot of the Resident Evil games focus on killing zombies and trying to fight for your survival against hordes of enemies and the like, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418370/Resident_Evil_7_Biohazard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 7</a> goes down a more stereotypical horror route. You have to explore the grungy southern farmhouse and uncover a ton of horrifying secrets. The family you meet are not what they seem, and they are bound to have you on edge. If you find yourself enjoying Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village ties in nicely to 7 to finish the story.</p>
<p>That concludes our list of horror games to play for Halloween. What will you be playing this Halloween?</p>

It almost seems like with every new entry of late the series has strayed from the desires of its outsized and fairly casual audience. <em>Call of Duty </em>is, after all, one of those games that most people pick up once a year and play till the next one comes along, much like a sports game. Folks who play those games tend to want refinements of core principles rather than drastic or convoluted reinventions.</p><p>All of which is to say, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s return-to-basics approach was a welcome bit of news among the cacophony of showcases, directs, and overbearing blog posts about why <em>this </em>game would be the best <em>Call of Duty </em>ever. After <em>MWIII</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005">flop of an open-ended campaign</a></span>, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>doubled down on having a cinematic, blockbuster story mode like the best in the series have offered. Its iteration on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562">Zombies feels like a healthy mixture of new and classic features</a></span> and mechanics. Even the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">multiplayer feels sensibly pared back</a></span>, and it restores tenets that fans have missed, like the prestige system. Treyarch and Xbox clearly want us to think that <em>Call of Duty </em>is “back,” but is it really?</p><p>According to the reviews that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is accruing on Steam, the answer’s a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no. Fans seem to generally agree that the campaign here is better than average, and some are even calling it the best story mode in a <em>COD </em>game in years. And of course there are players who have cherished the simplified renditions of both the competitive multiplayer suite and the cooperative Zombies mode, myself included. As is always going to be the case with a series this big and this polarizing, though, the more you look, the more people you’ll find who are disappointed in some of the game’s features.</p><p>One of the biggest problems many seem to have with <em>Black Ops 6 </em>actually has little to do with the game itself and more to do with the packaging, specifically the launcher, <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>. While the tool has been reworked since its initial release, it isn’t significantly better, and it seems to be even worse on PC, where fans of the series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502">seem to hate it more than I do</a></span>! One review joked that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is actually a “game is updating simulator.”</p><p>Elsewhere, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s various modes are causing division. Some are appreciating their time with the competitive multiplayer suite, but there are also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799">repeated mentions of terrible maps and spawns</a></span> throughout the reviews. Having played the beta extensively, as well as jumping in after launch, I can kind of agree that there don’t seem to be any unilateral winners among the crop of multiplayer arenas available right now. Zombies has enjoyed a more positive reception than multiplayer, but still there are players who are unhappy with the settings and crying out for more ambient (spookier) maps in the future.</p><p>Overall, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>seems to be earning its “Mixed” reception on Steam. It isn’t the greatest game, but it’s a perfectly fine and fun middling title, and that’s about all I need from it to have a great time. The divisiveness surrounding the game is at least producing some good material in the Steam reviews page, though, so read it and weep. </p><figure id="" data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-recommend-id="image://f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-format="png" data-width="1248" data-height="480" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;Campaign is pretty good and zombies is like Cold War with Classic features mixed in.

<p>Call of Duty players are already chomping at the bit, as they can’t wait for Ranked Play in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>. Unfortunately, the competitive mode hasn’t been available at launch, but Treyarch have confirmed that the game will have it. That said, its absence and the recent trend in previous CoD titles to introduce the mode late has left the community wondering when it will arrive.</p>



<p>Here’s everything we know about when Ranked Play is coming to Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</h2>



<p>Ranked Play will arrive in Black Ops 6 on<strong> November 14, 2024</strong>, which is also when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/">Season 1</a> begins. As soon as the first season update lands for Black Ops 6, players will be able to dive in and start their competitive journey, where they’ll be progressing through ranks and playing against similarly skilled enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.treyarch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch</a> will likely follow the same format as previous Ranked Play modes, with teams of 4 battling it out on a pool of carefully selected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/">maps and modes</a>. Players will have to build their loadout, working around restricted weapons, Perks, and Equipment in the Gunsmith. </p>



<p>The restrictions and rules are based on the Call of Duty League (CDL), the esports scene for the iconic FPS franchise. Players will climb <strong>Skill Divisions</strong>, which could be the same ones found in MW3, Bronze to Iridescent. As you win games, you gain Ranked Points that move you up these divisions, while if you lose the opposite happens.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p>We expect Black Ops 6 to have <strong>Hardpoint, Control, and Search and Destroy</strong>, but Treyarch are yet to confirm the modes. This is based on the modes that were available in MW3’s Ranked Play, which we expect to be similar to BO6’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</h2>



<p>We haven’t got much information regarding Black Ops 6’s Ranked Play just yet, but <strong>we assume that the mode will come with a reward system</strong>. Players will likely receive various rewards based on the Skill Division that they reach, the higher up the ladder they climb, the better the rewards. </p>



<p>If the rewards are similar to previous iterations of Ranked Play, you can expect to earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Skins, and more.</p>

              <section>

                <p>In 2008, Liam Neeson reinvented himself as an action star in Taken, a story about a former CIA officer who went to great lengths to rescue his abducted teenage daughter. That movie appears to be one of the primary inspirations behind Indifferent Penguin's upcoming game, Tackle for Loss. But the unnamed hero of this game has his own set of unique skills to unleash on the people who dared to kidnap his daughter in Tackle for Loss' reveal trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq_EOKUhVYY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bq_EOKUhVYY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the other inspirations for the game seems to be chronic traumatic encephalopathy--or CTE-- a neurological disorder that is often associated with concussions suffered by American pro sports athletes, especially football players. The lead character in Tackle for Loss is aware of his condition, and the violence that it brings out of him. There's also a touch of tragedy to his story, as he admits to not being able to remember his daughter's name. All he knows is that he loves her, and he'll get her back no matter how many bad guys he has to pulverize.</p><p>Tackle for Loss has a very retro visual style that seems reminiscent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hotline-miami-review/1900-6410681/" data-ref-id="1900-6410681">Hotline Miami</a>. The game does include some strategy by allowing players to unlock moves and upgrade their attacks as they progress through the story. Along the way, players will discover the truth behind the daughter's abduction and uncover a deeper conspiracy connected to the criminal underworld that took her.</p><p>German game developer Daniel Wichterich created Tackle for Loss by himself for his company, Indifferent Penguin. The game doesn't currently have a release date, but it is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930270/Tackle_for_Loss/?curator_clanid=44965716" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam's wishlist</a>.</p>

                <p>The debut of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass seemingly had a noticeable effect on engagement on Xbox, while the PS5 edition of the game saw a big jump as well in terms of active users. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7swcxzmmr2l" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Call of Duty HQ app--which includes Black Ops 6, Warzone, and Modern Warfare III--was played by 52% of active Xbox Series X|S users and 34% of active PS5 players on October 28. That compares to 19% and 18% on October 23 for Xbox and PlayStation, respectively.</p><p>The 52% for Xbox and 34% for PlayStation figures represented all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ, according to Piscatella, who was citing Circana's own Player Engagement Tracker.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The previous highs for US daily active player engagement for Call of Duty HQ on Xbox Series X|S was 34% (August 31, 2024) and 27% on PS5 (September 7, 2024).</p><p>What does this all mean? Piscatella wants to see more data before drawing conclusions, but for now, he said it supports the idea that Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass "very likely helped" improve engagement results on Xbox while also not significantly detracting engagement statistics on other platforms. "Still early, needs more data," Piscatella said.</p><p>"(And btw... over HALF of all daily active players on a platform playing one game [Call of Duty HQ] is bonkers engagement)," Piscatella said.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision previously announced that Black Ops 6 had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">"biggest" three-day opening weekend in franchise history</a> for total number of players, hours played, and matches. It was also recently confirmed that Activision has now sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">more than 500 million Call of Duty games.</a></p><p>During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's release on October 25 set a record for new Game Pass subscriber additions on launch day, though he didn't offer a specific figure. Nadella <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1851744627226734807" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">went on to say</a> that Black Ops 6 sales on PlayStation and Steam were up "over 60% year-over-year" compared against 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Black Ops 6 expands this week with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">highly anticipated Nuketown multiplayer map on November 1</a>. After that, Black Ops 6 Season 1 begins on November 14, and this also includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Call of Duty: Warzone's newest map, Area 99.</a></p><p>For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer reviews.</a></p>

            <p>
PUBG Studios, the studio behind, yup, PUBG, has unveiled Project ARC, a new 5v5 PvP shooter viewed from a top-down perspective and featuring 'shared real-time line of sight'.
</p>
<p>
Project ARC is officially described a "realistic and fast-paced top-down shooting experience inspired by PUBG: Battlegrounds" that promises "skill-based, thrilling" gunfights - utlising the likes of assault rifles, submachine tunes, shotguns, snipers, grenade launches, and more.
</p>
<p>
Its shooting action is built around what publisher Krafton calls "widely-known bomb mission rules" (and, yes, I had to look that up), with teams either attempting to hack or defend a hidden crypt each game. The hacking team must blow up the walls surrounding the crypt to gain access and install a Decrypter device, while the defending team tries to stop them.

<p>
All this is viewed from a top-down perspective, with Project ARC also touting a shared real-time line of sight. "Modern warfare," explains Krafton, "[is] based on disrupting the enemy's line of sight, securing your view quickly, and attacking before the enemy notices you... Real-time line of sight shared with your teammates... creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates".
</p>
<p>
Project ARC's characters are all said to have their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets, with the latter including grenades, recon drones, grenade launchers, proximity explosives, and throwable items including flashbangs and smoke grenades.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release for Project Arc just yet, or even platforms <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/Project_ARC/">beyond Steam</a>, but you can take a look at its action in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hTTvybcp7o">announcement trailer</a> above.

                <p>It's been tough times of late at Sony Interactive Entertainment, as the PlayStation company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/" data-ref-id="1100-6521383">began the year by cutting 900+ jobs and cancelling games. </a>In July, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">axed a number of positions from its Destiny studio, Bungie</a>, and announced a reorganization effort there. Then in August, Sony's Firewalk team launched a multiplayer FPS called Concord, only to close it quickly and offer refunds, before the studio itself <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">shut down for good</a> after reportedly spending $200 million+ on it. In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, SIE co-CEO Hermen Hulst reacted to these dramatic moves, saying they all took place as part of the company's effort to run a "sustainable business."</p><p>"I will say a few things on that. It's our duty to look at our our resource planning, and make sure that we run a sustainable business," he said. "That's part of being CEO. We never take that lightly, because we know these people personally, and it's very close to our hearts and the teams and good working atmospheres. But yes, we've had some layoffs."</p><p>Hulst went on to say that the PlayStation Studios division is actually "much greater" today in terms of employment numbers than it was five years ago. "It's grown tremendously. And that is organic growth that our existing teams, I think, hired quite aggressively, as well as through [mergers and acquisitions]," he said.</p><p>Hulst's defense of Sony's major cuts sounds similar to what Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said about Xbox's own dramatic business shifts that included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">2,500+ layoffs in the past year and numerous studio closures.</a> In March, Spencer said the initial round of job cuts announced in January was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">necessary to help Xbox become a profitable business</a> following the blockbuster buyout of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>2024, like 2023 before it, has been a brutal for layoffs in the video game developers and staff at Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, and many other companies. Some estimates suggest there have been more than 11,000 layoffs in the video game sector in 2024 alone.</p><p>A former PlayStation executive recently shared his thoughts on the cuts, claiming they are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. This executive, Chris Deering, was roundly criticized for saying people who have been laid off can just "go to the beach for a year."</p><p>A labor union, the Communication Workers of America (CWA), recently criticized Sony's decision to close Firewalk and shut down Concord, lamenting the kinds of decisions made by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-shutdown-just-another-example-of-bad-decision-by-highly-insulated-ceos-labor-union-says/1100-6527505/" data-ref-id="1100-6527505">"highly insulated video game CEOs."</a></p>

<section><p>Illfonic, Gun Media, and Boss Team Games have quickly become the go-to teams for translating classic horror movies into innovative video games.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Nearly a decade ago, in 2015, Gun Media and IllFonic were working together on Summer Camp, a horror game built to look like the slashers of a bygone era. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU-UTbmlQK0">announcement trailer</a> gives off strong Friday the 13th vibes, right down to the canoe wading through a (likely haunted) lake that surrounds the titular camp. No one knew it at the time, but this game would go on to ignite a spark in the video game horror space for years to come. Today, the trend of asymmetrical multiplayer horror games using licensed slashers and other Hollywood monsters still feels like it's only just begun.</p><p dir="ltr">Early on, Summer Camp was purely a homage; it was meant to recall the imagery of Jason's attacks on camp counselors through the '80s and '90s, but it wasn't officially attached to the IP. Around the same time, the Friday the 13th licensor group Horror Inc. and Crystal Lake Entertainment caught wind of the project during a period in which they had already been working with Steve Harris, today the CEO of Boss Team Games, and his partners at Diversion3 Entertainment to help find collaborators for a video game based on the IP. Summer Camp looked to be a great fit. Rather than a new slasher character meant as an ode to Jason Voorhees, what if the game could use the killer himself in his iconic hockey mask and all?</p><p dir="ltr">Harris and his partners approached Gun Media and asked if they'd be interested in changing its game from a clever homage to an officially licensed tie-in. Naturally, that was enticing for everyone. Following another investment round and a few more years of development, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/friday-the-13th-game-closes-with-800000-plus/1100-6432300/">hugely successful Kickstarter campaign</a>, Friday the 13th: The Game launched in 2017. Overloaded servers marred the game's early days, but it eventually grew to nearly 15 million lifetime players while bringing the many iterations of Jason to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside Dead By Daylight, launched just a year earlier, Friday the 13th revealed a burgeoning market for asymmetrical-multiplayer horror games. On one team, you have the killer, and on the other, you have several of his would-be victims--a natural fit with many horror franchises.</p><p dir="ltr">It's interesting to see what this subgenre looks like today and to estimate how it may look a few years from now, considering so much of the landscape is owed to a <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/18-3123/18-3123-2021-09-30.html" rel="nofollow ">landmark legal case</a> involving the Friday the 13th licensing rights and some of the original film's collaborators. First argued in court in 2020 and settled a year later, the outcome demanded that products using the Friday the 13th IP could no longer be sold or worked on. For Gun and IllFonic, this sadly included their game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393001-4149604-f13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393001" data-ratio="0.58506493506494" data-width="1540" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393001-4149604-f13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393001"></a><figcaption>Friday The 13th: The Game is, in some ways, the inception point for a trend that looks like it'll continue for years to come.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393001-4149604-f13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">DLC plans such as new maps, characters, and cosmetics were abruptly cut short; the game's post-launch support was no more. Effectively, it was snuffed out like one of Jason's victims in the shower; they never saw it coming. Both Gun and IllFonic were forced to move on to other projects, but because of their success with Friday the 13th, something else began to take shape.</p><p>From the cemetery plot of the Friday the 13th game, several more projects of a similar nature have sprung out of the ground: games like Gun's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, IllFonic's Predator: Hunting Grounds and Killer Klowns From Outer Space, and Boss Team Games' Evil Dead. Hollywood is increasingly interested in video games, and the people and teams that helped transpose Friday the 13th from film to a modern console and PC multiplayer game are being leaned on to make more magic happen with other icons of the horror genre.</p><p>Seeking to understand better how such deals are made, why they may sometimes fall through, and what else horror fans can expect to see in this emerging pocket of the games industry, I spoke to Steve Harris, CEO of publisher Boss Team Games, Wes Keltner, CEO of developer-publisher Gun Media, as well as Jared Gerritzen and Jordan Mathewson--chief design officer and design director, respectively--of developer-publisher IllFonic.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these talks, it became clear to me that licensing is sometimes a minefield that these horror-obsessed teams navigate nonetheless. Though it was a love of the genre that got them involved in the first place, they're now being viewed as the go-to creators when Hollywood comes calling with more horror icons in need of video game adaptations.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When A Licensor Calls</h2><p dir="ltr">"The appetite's there," Keltner told me. "Hollywood is starting to understand that video games are bigger than movies and music combined. I think, before, the conversations I was having, even in 2018, there were still film companies out there that were looking at video games as a way to market a movie. And obviously that's not how you do it."</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, on the Hollywood side, collaborators are too focused on the <em>next</em> part of a franchise, not what Gerritzen called "the beloved part," which may be the original, such as it is in the case of Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Other times, it may be a blend of parts, like with Friday The 13th: The Game, where many iterations of Jason are represented because he isn't really in the first movie and doesn't don his iconic mask until the third one. IllFonic would later use a similar approach with Predator: Hunting Grounds; in the game, the many versions of the titular creature span all of the movies and then some. The essential parts that make sense as a game can vary, but movie studios don't always envision those parts as important in the first place. </p><p dir="ltr">For "the better part of the last 15 years," Keltner said, movie studios have been involved in games but in a different way, and it's a way that studios like his and the others I spoke to aren't really interested in as much, if at all. "What they've been leveraging their IP to do is free-to-play mobile games" as a way of "supporting a movie that was about to come out," he continued. "And in their eyes, the cheapest way to do that and to get the maximum amount of eyeballs was to do a mobile game, make it free. And maybe it generates money, maybe it doesn't. But that wasn't their motivation, necessarily.</p><p dir="ltr">"So you had some folks that kind of understood video games, but they understood it from a mobile space. But what I've been seeing in the last few years is folks coming over, they've been at AAA publishers, and they're coming in and saying, 'Mobile is one facet. If your goal is just word of mouth to support a new movie, stick with mobile. It's probably not a bad idea. You're going to get it done faster. Gonna be a lot of eyeballs that won't cost as much. Go for it. But if your goal is to potentially create a whole new platform, where a new generation of people are going to experience this IP in a way they couldn't before, you need to start looking at console and PC. It's gonna cost more, it's gonna take longer, but the impact is 1,000 times what could have happened if you just made a mobile game.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Keltner explained how his team has used Friday the 13th as a "case study" to bring to interested rights-holders from the movie world to demonstrate how a well-made video game can be the rising tide that lifts all proverbial boats for an IP. "You're going to see more people--a whole new generation of people--renting your movies, buying your movies, buying merch, looking for Halloween costumes. You're going to start trending on Instagram, TikTok--like, all this is going to happen from the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Harris added that the film industry has "caught on" to the enormity of video games, he told me. There's money to be made, and where that's the case, Hollywood is open for business. "Most of the studios," he said, "now have gaming divisions," naming MGM, Lionsgate, and Legendary as examples, who seek out the right developers to adapt their IP. "They understand what the process is, and they understand the challenges that we have from the development side and marketing side. But they're astute. They know what's involved."</p><p dir="ltr">IllFonic expressed the same. "There's just been a major amount of growth in the past few years of respect for video games," Gerritzen said. "Because when [Friday the 13th] happened, it was still that era of like, 'Oh, IP, slap a game together, make a game.'"</p><p dir="ltr">All three teams said the change seems to be driven largely by a generational divide. As older Hollywood executives have been filtered out for younger people who are more likely to have played games all their lives, these people have built bridges between the old guard within Hollywood and the game developers who are eager to bring their IP to life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393023-ss_3e8183bd7b7897405eb3503658af2a56533e1222.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393023" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393023-ss_3e8183bd7b7897405eb3503658af2a56533e1222.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393023"></a><figcaption>Gun's Texas Chain Saw Massacre was the first licensed horror PvP game to use a 4v3 setup.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393023-ss_3e8183bd7b7897405eb3503658af2a56533e1222.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"They're starting to see that there are passionate people in [the games industry] who are wanting to do a lot to elevate what they have into something that's going to attach to the generation of people who are much more into video games, and they're starting to understand it as the entertainment medium that it is," Mathewson told me.</p><p dir="ltr">The appetite is so strong, I was told, that these studios are more often being pitched <em>to</em> rather than proactively sending out feelers to see if they can get ahold of a beloved horror property. While Boss Team sometimes enjoys a more direct line to Hollywood given Harris' prior career in filmmaking, serendipity has been a reliable ally, too. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game, for example, grew from Ian Henkel, son of the film's writer Kim Henkel, having played and enjoyed Friday the 13th. The younger Henkel wanted to see Gun's take on his family's IP, and a few years later, it exists--as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">one of the scariest games I've ever played</a>, no less.</p><p dir="ltr">IllFonic's Predator: Hunting Grounds has a similar origin story. Gerritzen said it started when the team "high-leveled" the game's concept one night. "The next day, [IllFonic CEO Chuck Brungardt] walks past a guy. He gets introduced to a guy from [20th Century] Fox, and he's like, 'Oh, we were just talking about Predator last night.' And then they talk, and he's like, 'Yeah, I just got a new creative director; his name's Jared.' And the guy knew me, and he's like, 'Oh, let's jump on a call next week.'"</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rosemary's Maybe</h2><p dir="ltr">But just having a line to communicate isn't enough to make a deal happen. Scheduling meetings eventually means negotiating, and sometimes those talks break down for a number of reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would say a half-dozen to maybe 10 other horror IP [rights holders] have come to us that we had to politely decline. They just either didn't fit what we wanted to do, we didn't really feel that passionate about the property, or the terms that were being discussed were not conducive to our side really making any money," Keltner revealed. He gave an example of how an early meeting might unfold, telling the licensors, 'I want to take your movie. I want to turn it into a game like this. And here's what Gun does. Here's what we've done in the past. This is my budget, and this is the team that's going to work on it.'</p><p dir="ltr">"You find out whether or not it's going to fit right. And we usually get to the money, like, real fast, because that's usually what can throw everything off. Like, what are the terms of this deal? So you don't get into the nitty-gritty of the creative around the game. You always go for the big thing first, which is, like, 'What do you want? What cut do you expect from this,' you know?"</p><p dir="ltr">The snag, Keltner told me, is "almost always money or creative control." Gun had even made it to the prototyping stage with one project before it had to bow out. "That company wanted complete creative control and ownership of the code, and I'm like, 'You don't get that. That's not how this works,' you know? And they're like, 'Well, then we're not doing this deal.' And I go, 'Okay, see ya.' And we had to stop everything."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393025-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393025" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393025-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393025"></a><figcaption>Some horror icons have shown up all over games, like Ghost Face shown here in Hunt Showdown, but don't yet have their own games to call home.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393025-unnamed%289%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As Gerritzen has learned working at IllFonic, Hollywood behaves very differently from the games industry. In his mind, it operates more like a "giant quagmire" when it comes to ownership. "A game is an employer paying people. A movie is like a bunch of outsourcers, I'll say, or contractors. And it's like, 'Okay, well, anything that I make, I own because you want to pay me the cheapest.' Now, you have all these people owning different pieces of different things and all of that." In seeking the right partners to adapt IP, IllFonic has "gone through it all, really," he said. "And so now when we look at IPs, those are major factors that have to come into play [...] Is this free and clear? How many people are in it? We could talk about, 'Oh, man, wouldn't it be cool if <em>this</em>, and wouldn't it be cool if <em>that</em>?' And then you start to talk to people, and it's like, 'Oh, that's owned by 13 different people.'"</p><p dir="ltr">While doing research for this story, I learned that the licensor for the Scream franchise is not the same entity as the licensor for Ghost Face, the iconic mask worn by the killers throughout the film franchise. To my dismay, this seemed to be news to each of the teams I spoke to, which hinted to me that none of them are secretly making the asymmetrical Scream game I long for. But it also elicited varied reactions from the developers I met with. The idea of multiple licensors was sometimes seen as a red flag. But sometimes, having multiple licensors isn't the headache it might appear to be.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Evil Dead, there were five different licenses involved in that," Harris told me. "Frankly, I thought it would be more challenging than it ended up being. But you know, it was [about] coming up with an idea that allowed us to sort of very cleanly divide what we were doing with each of the [licenses] and got everybody on board with the idea that we were going to do this mash-up. And once everybody had signed off on that, it was pretty easy."</p><h2 dir="ltr">I Saw The IP Glow</h2><p dir="ltr">Even for those with proverbial scars from the Friday the 13th court drama, more recent and tidier collaborations have renewed the hope that this subgenre can survive Hollywood's IP quagmire. Keltner spoke highly of the Henkel family, who, in stark contrast to much of Hollywood's MO, exclusively owns the rights to the original 1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The Henkels have worked with the studio to bring several new characters to the game based on a lore bible that the film's screenwriter, Kim Henkel, has kept for decades.</p><p dir="ltr">This allowed the team to expand on but remain faithful in spirit to the source material. It's even led to a new mode in the game called Rush Week in which Johnny, one of the characters exclusive to the video game, leaves the infamous Texas home to torment sorority sisters in the vein of an entirely different horror classic, Black Christmas.</p><p dir="ltr">That sort of freedom to take the IP and build something new is crucially important to the game makers, who need to know the film studios or other rights-holders will trust them and give them the space to experiment at times. Because both parties are fans of the IP, it's in everyone's interest to adapt it in a manner that feels true to the source, even when things stretch beyond a movie's original vision.</p><p dir="ltr">"We put [makeup effects artist and director Tom] Savini and Elvira into [Killer Klowns From Outer Space] and it was just like--this doesn't make sense, but they're [horror] royalty," Gerritzen said excitedly. "In Predator, we made female predators. In Ghostbusters, we added a ton of new stuff, talking spirit guides and all that. You have to know the IP before you start working on the IP. It's kind of like if someone were to come to IllFonic or me and say, 'Hey, I want to write a book about you,' or 'I want to do a documentary about you,' and they don't know anything about you. It's like, I'm not going to trust them to do this."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393026-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-elvira-tom-savini-novita.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393026" data-ratio="0.56203164029975" data-width="1201" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393026-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-elvira-tom-savini-novita.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393026"></a><figcaption>Game studios working with licensed IP sometimes want licensors who grant them the latitude to mix things up in novel ways.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393026-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-elvira-tom-savini-novita.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Because IllFonic has established itself as a major player in this space, licensors have come to trust the team with their IP more easily, usually thrilled to see what a game can add to the franchise in ways the movies never could. "Like, we're really massive horror fans," Gerritzen told me. "And, you know, I definitely think that the horror community is so welcoming to so much stuff [...] For us, it's like, we can do something really huge. We can do these things that would have blown their budget out of the water in most cases. And so for us, when we talk to the creators or the IP owners, and we get deep into it, most of the time they're beyond ecstatic that we're adding to their world and to their universe."</p><h2 dir="ltr">I Know What You Did Last Collab</h2><p dir="ltr">Working in the space of licensed asymmetrical horror games also comes with an added complication: Dead By Daylight (DBD). Behaviour Interactive's horror game has been the genre leader for years, even as its intentions are slightly different. Whereas games like Killer Klowns, Friday the 13th, and Evil Dead are bespoke, standalone games meant to capture the spirit of singular movies or franchises, Dead By Daylight is basically spooky Fortnite, with a roster of dozens of monsters--some original, but many licensed, too. The list of screen legends includes characters in these other teams' games, like Michael Myers and Leatherface, but also many others who haven't been given their own games (yet), like Chucky, Freddy Krueger, and my personal favorite, Ghost Face.</p><p dir="ltr">Harris told me the DBD question does come up at times, but that it usually isn't something that prevents a standalone experience existing alongside it. "I've had conversations with different rights holders [and asked] 'Well, if you do a Dead by Daylight character, or put it in Fortnite, or whatever it is, does that limit your ability to do a standalone game?' [...] I don't really think so. I think they're very distinct in terms of what they're trying to accomplish and how the games would play."</p><p dir="ltr">Keltner similarly cited how DBD brings in many iconic characters, but always does so in the context of the game's 4v1 mode (or the newer 8v2 mode) that involves starting noisy generators to open an escape path as killers stalk the map. DBD can fit almost any horror icon in its format, but it's always going to be in <em>its</em> format. "All the power to [Behaviour], because people love it," Keltner told me. "And we went down this other route, which was cinematic and true to the one, singular IP. So instead of trying to be the Swiss army knife where you can take any IP and stick it in this thing, we wanted to concentrate on, 'Let's make the complete Jason experience.' And seeing those two avenues, I think Hollywood looked at that and went, 'Oh, wow, look what you could do.' You could leverage single characters, or you could take the entire IP and try to make a game based on it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393027-screenshot_3_33879d7bc3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393027-screenshot_3_33879d7bc3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393027"></a><figcaption>Dead By Daylight has helped shape the genre, even as it intends to do something different than most of its genre counterparts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393027-screenshot_3_33879d7bc3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Asymmetrical games just provide this perfect chemistry when you're trying to bring these things to life," Mathewson said. "Because I think we all recognize there's a really substantial cross-pollination between the fanbases of these types of movies and people that like to play games. And we are <em>them</em>. We grew up with these things, and we had that connectivity and really resonated, you know, at a younger age. And now, we're getting to this point, we're making games, and we have access to this new game type that really fits in well with these different IPs."</p><p dir="ltr">Being the subgenre's busiest, most-called-upon studios could also drive competition amongst the teams. Perhaps when you're operating at the level of popular FPS or sports games, that's truer. But the people I spoke to only had nice things to say about their peers from other teams.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's rival schools," Gerritzen said. "Like, that's all it is. It's not like Halo versus COD type of stuff. You know, it's fun. It's a lot of fun."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm ride-or-die for IllFonic," Keltner told me. "We've been in the trenches. We spent five years together [on Friday the 13th]. I mean, you get to know every lead and every person under their lead, and their wives' names, and you're hanging out at their studio, you're getting pizza and beer with them at night, you're setting up at three in the morning waiting for the build to cook, and you're just telling stupid stories so you don't fall asleep. I mean, it's just, they are bros, through and through, right? So anytime I see them get [an IP], I'm the first cheerleader. I never look at it like, 'Oh, dang it. I should have [gotten] that' or whatever. And I want to work with them again, 100%."</p><p dir="ltr">"We're all off working on different things and trying to bring new experiences into the world in slightly different ways," Harris said. "I would have loved to do something with Predator, but IllFonic did it. They may have wanted to do something with Texas Chain Saw Massacre, but Gun did it. So fortunately, if you look at the products that are coming out, we're all trying to be very faithful to the source material. We're trying to advance gameplay within the asymmetrical space. And you know, as long as we have some success in doing that, I think the real winner there's the player."</p><h2 dir="ltr">House Of 1000 Concepts</h2><p dir="ltr">Harris' words spoke to one other insight I sought from each of the teams: their horror IP wishlists. Let's imagine, I told them, there is no quagmire. They can have any IP. They're all open and willing to collaborate. Which series do they reach for first? The answers were excitingly diverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Keltner named several that have been stirring in my mind for a while too, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing. "I also have a soft spot for Return of the Living Dead, just because it was a very different, very punk, very nihilistic approach to making zombie stuff. And it just felt like it carved right through pop culture to where now people say 'braaaaaiiins' and that didn't exist before that movie." He named one more too, presumably knowing it's spoken for: Halloween. Though Boss Team recently published RetroRealms Arcade--retro-style platformers based on Halloween and Ash vs. Evil Dead--the team has also revealed a second Halloween game is in the works, built in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p dir="ltr">Specifics about the gameplay or its genre beyond being a horror project have not been revealed yet, but it would stand to reason it may be something like the asymmetrical games we've seen to date. Curiously, the folks from IllFonic were cagier in naming specific IP on their wishlist, laughing off the question and insinuating that perhaps one or more of the franchises that would be on their wishlists has already been checked off but not yet revealed publicly.</p><p dir="ltr">Joked Mathewson, "I tried to think of something, but yeah, it's a no-win scenario." Whether IllFonic is Boss Team's partner on the upcoming Halloween game, I can't say for sure. But Mathewson did note that IllFonic has no plans of exiting this space any time soon. "We're going to use everything that we've built up to this point to continue to thrive, to bring everything to a new level, because we love games," Mathewson added. "We love these types of games specifically, too, and we feel like there's a lot more to add to it, and we're going to keep doing it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393028-3897432-dek-freddy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4393028" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393028-3897432-dek-freddy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4393028"></a><figcaption>A Nightmare on Elm Street's dream setting seems like it would be conducive to crafting interesting new gameplay hooks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393028-3897432-dek-freddy.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Harris and Keltner said similar things, though everyone stressed the need to keep pushing the genre forward. If these asymmetrical horror games feel too similar, you'll lose everyone but the "5%" of players, Kelter said, who are the "horror nerds" like those within these studios and who would play them anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">"Anything can become oversaturated, but I think that reflects back on ourselves and the other companies that you mentioned, always advancing that genre of games," Harris told me. "Otherwise, it will just become stale. I mean, if you're not doing something new--put the IP aside for a second--if you're not making a game that's offering players something new, then there's not a point in doing it."</p><p dir="ltr">For Keltner, it's about aligning his team's vision with IP partners who can match their zeal. "What are their goals? What do they want to achieve? I want authenticity. I want a white-glove approach. I want interesting design. I want forward-thinking design. And I want horror nerds who are not going to leave any stone unturned, and that it's something that, hopefully, can stand the test of time."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-bans-linux-leaving-steam-deck-out-in-the-cold.1024482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and developer Respawn have announced that&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>can no longer be played on Linux operating systems, potentially leaving Steam Deck players out in the cold without a workaround.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/article/1852019667315102151" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an update posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Respawn puts the decision down to a desire to maintain "competitive integrity" in&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>. The developer says Linux is a "path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-linux-ban-characters.jpg?itok=llo29sIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-linux-ban-characters.jpg?itok=gzFlRQtZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Linux&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>player, Respawn has bad news for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Respawn admits that the&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Linux population is "small", but the "impact" of those players "infected a fair amount of players' games".</p>

<p>Addressing the issue in a more nuanced way would have required an "outsized level of focus and attention" given the Linux platform's size, so the decision was made to ban Linux outright instead. This decision takes effect "immediately", too, so you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Apex&nbsp;</em>on Linux anymore.</p>

<p>If, however, you decide to install Windows on your Steam Deck, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>that way. If you prefer to play&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>directly from your Steam Deck's OS, however, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This also won't affect&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>players who are playing on Steam via Windows platforms, nor, of course, those who are playing on console or anywhere else (unless that "anywhere else" happens to be a PC running Linux, of course).</p>




<p><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>has run into problems with cheaters in the past.</p>

<p>Back in March, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-global-series-hack">bizarre hacking incident</a> saw professional&nbsp;<em>Apex&nbsp;</em>players being hit with a hack that injected various unfair advantages into their games, including wallhacks and aimbots. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/someone-is-repeatedly-breaching-apex-legends-accounts">not the only time</a> the game has run afoul of cheating and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-hacked-with-save-titanfall-message">hacking</a>, either.</p>

<p>This announcement also comes shortly after Valve announced that developers who want their games to be on Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure">must declare</a> whether their titles have kernel-level anti-cheat mechanisms in place.&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>is one such game; it uses the popular Easy Anti-Cheat software.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a series of images showcasing the in-progress rework of Customs, one of the most iconic and popular maps in the pioneering extraction shooter title. It has been years since Customs was first added to the game, and it already been altered a few times, but this latest change is nothing short of an overhaul.</p>



<p>Check out the images below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mad-changes">Mad Changes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games is taking Customs and turning it on its head, implementing some major changes that’ll make it seem like an entirely new map. That’s what the team did recently with Factory, adding new areas and adjusting what was existing to make it feel much bigger and more detailed.</p>



<p>The latest images reveal the opening of buildings that were previously inaccessible, or adding extra details to those that were. </p>

<p>It looks like the Repair Shop and the area around it have been upgraded immeasurably, and some of the smaller interiors around the Scav Checkpoint have been altered. Further underground portions have been added, which will add more depth to the relatively one-dimensional map. </p>



<p>Battlestate flicked through <strong>many </strong>changes coming to Escape from Tarkov in the next and future updates, including a rework to hipfire and ADS mechanics, winter clothing, new weapons, and an array of grenades and attachments. It’s a tasty package, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s super-spooky Halloween event is live now, and it’s forcing players to contend with bloodthirsty zombies on Labs. As if the map wasn’t tough enough already, the latest update has pumped the undead into The Lab, and entry to the map, which is usually locked behind a keycard, is free.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-and-loaded">Locked and Loaded</h2>



<p>If you’re heading to Labs, you’ll need to go loaded for action – zombies are running rampant and taking no prisoners.</p>



<p>Because zombies don’t really do that.</p>



<p>When you enter the map, you’ll be hit by a blast of radiation that doesn’t dissipate and surprise, surprise – there are no gas masks to be found anywhere within easy reach. </p>



<p>Presently, it seems like there are no special tactics involved in taking them down, but they are tanky. It’s best to go with the age-old tactic of shooting them in the head with some large-calibre weapons if you want the most successful journey through the map.</p>



<p>Players are still discovering the event as we speak, so more secrets may be revealed as the night goes on and Halloween hits in earnest.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Escape from Tarkov and are eager to explore the Halloween update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>After years of rumors, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">formally announced the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> last month, but not without some hiccups along the way. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag has led to some outcry</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">the lack of an included disc drive</a> is also unpopular. Regardless, Sony Interactive Entertainment co-CEO Hideaki Nishino has reiterated the company's commitment to both versions of the PS5, as well as a 10-year lifecycle for this console generation.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Nishino said that he was happy to see that the "most engaged gaming users are interested in the PS5 Pro," and shared his belief that "new users will grab the PS5 Pro as well." "We design everything with having one ahead in our mind," added Nishino. "It's not like we just make a next step and we don't know about the two steps ahead. That's not our way of working, because we need to make sure that the 10-year-old, generation cycle continues to be going as well."</p><p>The PlayStation 4 Pro was introduced in 2016, only four years before the launch of PlayStation 5. However, there are still PlayStation 4 games in production, which means its life cycle has now reached 11 years even though the PS5 has been Sony's primary focus since 2020. Will Sony really wait until 2028-2030 to release its next-gen PlayStation 6 if Microsoft releases another generational upgrade of the Xbox first? Nishino didn't address that, but he did stress that the PlayStation 5 Pro is not a next-gen console.</p><p>"I just wanted to say that the Pro is not a next gen," said Nishino. "It is still in the PS5 generation. PS5 Pro will do everything what PS5 does. So it's a consumer choice. If they see a need for more visuality, they will get it. So we wanted to provide an option for the consumer within the generation, that's what we're doing."</p><p>PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7.</p>
