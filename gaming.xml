			<p>Much to many people's surprise, Assassin's Creed Shadows is knocking it out of the park. While Monster Hunter Wilds was an incredibly big game, with it selling eight million copies in just a matter of days. On top of that, it reached 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam. However, Assassin's Creed Shadows is hot on the trails of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached around<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/"> two million players</a> and is continuing to increase. Compared to Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin's Creed takes the lead in physical copies sold in the UK. At present, Shadows is the biggest physical launch of the year in the country, as noted by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1903885728821674283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring</a>.</p>
<p>This feudal Japan title saw it reach over one million players on launch day, despite the ongoing <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-damning-reports-of-abuse-by-assassins-creed-shadows-studio/">controversy</a> throughout the advertising period of the game. It was also delayed multiple times, but it seems that was for a good reason, as most audiences who have played the game seem to be happy with what they've gotten from it.</p>
<p>With Assassin's Creed Shadows reaching over two million players, it means that it has now bested the performance of Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, two of the newer titles that performed incredibly well for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Dring also mentions that it has sold more boxed copies in one week than <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> did in three months, which is a bit of a harsh statistic for Ubisoft. However, for most, it won't come as a surprise, as even Ubisoft has acknowledged that Star Wars Outlaws did not perform in the way they wanted. In some aspects, Assassin's Creed Shadows was their final hope to produce something in recent years that had the chance to be majorly successful, as Assassin's Creed Mirage didn't quite hit the mark for some players, either.</p>
<p>However, there are still plans for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/"> first DLC</a> to be released for Assassin's Creed Mirage, with ongoing support and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-gets-a-free-dlss-3-mod-thanks-to-lukefz/">mods</a> being released for the title.</p>
<p>While the game holds this very impressive information at the moment, it is likely that it will have it snatched from them by releases such as Call of Duty, Mario Kart 9, or Grand Theft Auto VI, should it be released this year.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this game, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Francesco De Meo's review</a> of the title, where he gave it a generous score of 8.7, calling it a "gorgeous dive into feudal chaos."</p>

Mountainous town-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/laysara-summit-kingdom">Laysara: Summit Kingdom</a> has received a Sandbox update that, essentially, turns a game about settling the slopes of precisely <em>one</em> mountain into a lightweight trading empire simulator. Where the early access game's existing modes have you doing up one Bonsai Everest at a time, Sandbox lets you switch between several and export goods for other alpine mayors to buy. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a significant addition to an early access project that had our Nic Reuben in fits of ecstasy, smashing his Grinchy heart asunder to reveal the wholesome yak fanboi lurking within. "Possibly the prettiest city builder I've ever seen," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/laysara-summit-kingdom-is-a-stunning-mountainous-city-builder-thats-out-now-in-early-access">declared</a> back at the game's early access launch, like a judge at a yak contest waving around a yak-hair bagful of yak-hair rosettes. Nic is away this week, so I am reasonably safe from repercussions over painting him as a smelly weirdo yak enthusiast. That said, I might ban him from the comments in advance, just to be safe.
</p>
<p>
I played a bit of Laysara: Summit Kingdom's demo last year myself, and yeah, it's good, though its fantasy world seems heavily informed by caricatures about Himalayan communities and Tibetan monasteries. Its town construction is shaped by elevation, with different kinds of vegetation and other resources and perils at higher altitudes. There's the omni-present risk of avalanches, but you can fortify your towns and plant forests to redirect the vengeful ice.</p>
<p>I never did a lot of it in the demo, but I do like this subliminal "avalanche sculpting sim" element. It makes me wonder if Polish developers Quite OK Games harbour any systemic aspirations of the "get lava computers working inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>" variety.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/">As detailed on Steam</a>, Sandbox Mode adds a World Map for switching between towns. You'll have a few unlocked to begin with, expanding your empire of peakvilles by raising temples on summits. Building temples also increases your research level across your entire empire. "Six new mountains!" the Steam changelog adds, like somebody forgetting the lyrics for The Twelve Days of Christmas. If they'd put that in a footnote I could have made a joke about foothills.
</p>
<p>
The changelog includes various smaller tweaks. They've added the option to construct ice altars during Free Build on certain maps, "a more detailed UI research panel, showing where does research comes from", and "more precise cursor detection when clicking on Advanced Yak Breeding". Got to be surgical, when match-making yaks.
</p>
<p>
The developers comment in the post that Sandbox Mode is about "expanding your kingdom in whatever way you see fit" with only "a few tiny story bits and a single global objective to provide a general sense of purpose". That said, it's also a taste of their plans for the game's forthcoming campaign, which will be "a more 'directed' sandbox experience with more detailed objectives (similar to what you've seen in the Scenarios)". The campaign will arrive with the game's 1.0 release later this year.

<p>Pocketpair will consider releasing Palworld for the Nintendo Switch 2 if the console is ‘beefy enough’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-is-palworld-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Is Palworld Coming to Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p>Pocketpair communications director John ‘Bucky’ Buckley spoke about Palworld on the Nintendo Switch 2 during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> at GDC San Fransisco. Bucky first talked about the console’s specs, stating that he has been “walking around GDC”, hoping that someone will reveal Switch 2’s specs to him. However, everyone he has interacted with has said, “They haven’t even seen them”. He stated they couldn’t make the game for the original Switch as Palworld is “a beefy game”.</p>



<p>Bucky added that Palworld on Nintendo Switch 2 is “100% worth considering”, provided the console is “beefy enough.” The developers already have experience with handheld optimisations with their release on the Steam Deck and are “happy with how it turned out”, even though there’s still some work to do. Pocketpair would like to get Palworld “on more handhelds if possible.”</p>



<p>At the same time, Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld continues, with recent updates stating that the former has received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new patent</a> that might help their case. Pocketpair recently spoke about the lawsuit, saying it “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came as a shock</a>” for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair publishing has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned players</a> not to expect ‘more Palworld’. Also, the game recently released its much-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-cross-play-update-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cross-play update</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld releasing for the Switch 2?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The Cold variants will spawn in, well, anywhere that's cold. That includes the Taiga, Windswept Hills, Snowy Plains, and even the Deep Dark and The End. The Warm variants spawn in the opposite, so places like the Savanna, Jungle, Badlands, Mangrove Swamps, and the Nether's biomes.</p><p>They're not the only mobs getting attention, as the Wolf gets six new sounds. Each wolf will receive a random sound variant when it spawns, and will stick with that for its existence. The existing wolf noises are used for the Classic variant, and Minecraft is adding Big, Cute, Puglin, Angry, Grumpy, and Sad.</p><h3 id="New_Minecraft_blocks">New Minecraft blocks</h3><p>As well as the attention to mobs, Minecraft's blocks are becoming more diverse. Bushes will generate in the Plains, Windswept Hills, River and Frozen River, and all Forest biomes. They are tinted by the grass color of the biome that they are placed or spawn in, and can be used in the composter. Using bone meal on a bush generates a neighboring bush if there is space. Harvesting bushes can be done using any tool with Silk Touch, or the shears.</p><p>The Cactus Flower is a new type of flower that has a chance of generating cacti. It can be placed on cactus blocks, or any block which has center support at the top. If a cactus is one or two blocks high, there is a 10% chance of a Cactus Flower growing on it, instead of the cactus getting taller. If the cactus is three or more blocks high, the growth chance increases to 25%, but they'll only grow if there is space on all sides. Any tool can mine it, and it can also be used to craft pink dye.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464147-minecraft-next-update.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464147-minecraft-next-update.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464147"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Firefly Bushes emit light and ambient sounds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464147-minecraft-next-update.jpg"></figure><p>The Firefly Bush is a long-awaited addition after Minecraft controversially removed Fireflies from the game following concerns that they were toxic to frogs in real life, and that by eating them in-game, it was a potential issue. The Firefly Bush is being added now, which will generate in swamps, near rivers, near water in Mangrove Swamps, and rarely in the Badlands. When it's dark, you'll spot glowing firefly particles up to five blocks from a Firefly Bush. It will play immersive, ambient sounds as long as it's not blocked from above and it's nighttime. Using bone meal on a Firefly bush will generate a neighboring one as long as there is space. It also emits a light level of 2, but will be instantly broken without any particular tool.</p><p>Leaf Litter is another block being added to Minecraft to improve the immersive nature of the game. It's a decorative block that can be found in forests and wooded badlands biomes. It works in a similar way to the petals blocks, and up to four can be placed on the same block, increasing the density of the Leaf Litter the more you place per block. Smelting any type of leaves block will create Leaf Litter, and it can also be used as fuel for smelting. It also comes with unique block sounds--we can't wait to trample through the leaves in Fall.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464148-minecraft-next-update%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464148" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464148-minecraft-next-update%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464148"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Leaf Litter is a new decorative block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464148-minecraft-next-update%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Short Dry Grass is one block high and generates in the desert and badlands biomes. Tall Dry Grass is also one block high, but aesthetically taller. It can be placed on sand, terracotta, and dirt blocks similarly to the dead bush. You can collect Short or Tall Dry Grass using shears or any tool with Silk Touch. Using bone meal on Short Dry Grass turns it into Tall Dry Grass. Sheep can eat it to regrow their wool, too.</p><p>Wildflowers are a new type of flower exclusive to birch and old growth birch forests as well as meadows. You can have up to four Wildflowers per one block, similar to other petals and flowers decorations. They can be crafted into yellow dye.</p><p>The Test and Test Instance blocks are technical blocks used in game tests, also being added to the game.</p><p>The Blue Egg is a variant of the egg which is only laid by the cold chicken variant, and spawns another cold chicken when hatched. The Brown Egg is the warm chicken's alternative.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464149-minecraft-next-update%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464149-minecraft-next-update%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464149"></a><figcaption>Fallen trees decorated with mushrooms</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4464149-minecraft-next-update%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="World_generation">World generation</h3><p>Also being added to the game in 1.21.5 are fallen trees. These change the way that trees can appear throughout the game. Now, you may find Oak, Spruce, Birch, or Jungle trees horizontally across the ground. The Birch version can be short or long, and all variants can be found anywhere in the game apart from the Meadow, Bamboo Jungle, River, Grove, or Flower Forest. Fallen trees can even be decorated with mushrooms or vines.</p><h3 id="Sounds">Sounds</h3><p>New sounds being added to the game include dead bush blocks playing ambient sounds when placed on top of two blocks that are any color terracotta, sand, or red sand blocks in any biome. Those three blocks also have a chance of playing ambient sounds when surrounded by one of them at least three sides eight blocks away.</p><p>That's everything coming to Minecraft in the next update.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> won't include a minimap for its exploration, though a compass will be added to the explorable world map for release.</p>
<p>The game's producer, and developer Sandfall Interactive COO Francois Meurisse confirmed this to me at an Xbox event during this year's Game Developers Conference (GDC), following some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-three-hours-has-confirmed-all-my-hopes-and-fears-about-this-gorgeous-new-action-rpg">criticism during previews that environments were hard to navigate</a>.</p>
<p>"There won't be mini maps in the levels," said Meurisse. "When there's a mini map, you can end up relying on it. And we want players to discover the world as the expedition does it. They don't have a map because every previous expedition failed. So yes, sometimes it can be difficult to find their way."</p>

<p>He continued: "What we added on the world map that wasn't in the preview demo is just a compass, so you can find north easily and get your direction more easily." There will also be an overview map of the entire game world.</p>
<p>Since the game's first reveal, much has been made of its JRPG influences from the likes of Final Fantasy and Persona, with its turn-based battle system and stylish menus. But what particularly struck me from the preview was the influence of FromSoftware, both from Dark Souls and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. There are obvious parallels: the sense of satisfaction from a successful parry as the camera zooms for a big slow-motion hit, as well as the weapon attribute scaling based on character stats. But it's also there in the aforementioned level design - it may be more linear, but it offers a similar sense of getting lost in an overwhelming, dangerous environment.</p>
<p>Meurisse explained the game is balanced between fairly linear, or semi-open levels with side path opportunities, which are accessed through the JRPG-style explorable world map. This is intended to tell a focused story. "The design approach has some links with FromSoftware games," he said, "where it's very linear levels but really intense ones. We don't have the mastery of ideas that they have, but it was part of the inspiration."</p>
<p>The Souls influence was definitely intentional, said Meurisse. What's more, the game's director, Guillaume Broche, is not just a big fan of FromSoftware but was also a Sekiro speedrunner. "I hope we'll have some good feedback and players from that community playing the game," said Meurisse. "I can't wait to have some players doing no damage runs, because technically it's achievable."</p>
<p>The game's turn-based battles are heavily-inspired by RPGs, but with action elements to allow players to parry and dodge enemy attacks. And rather than mana or skill points for character abilities, the system gives characters a certain number of action points to spend each turn. This was inspired by deck-building games, as Broche is also a huge Magic the Gathering player.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Beyond all these influences, though, the game has a distinctly and authentic French tone, from its costume design to the inclusion of French swear words in the script - after all, the Montpellier-based team is predominantly French. While the gameplay is clearly Japanese-inspired, the team didn't want to mimic manga or anime graphics, but instead find its own unique style. "When you tell a story or imagine a world, it's usually good to start with something you're familiar with," said Meurisse, which led to the Belle Epoque and Art Deco references.</p>
<p>"The will for searching for something more unique made it natural to link with the art references we knew the best, for being French," he added," but it wasn't a specific studio guideline to say 'we are French, we want to do something French'". Still, he's "happy and proud" of the French inspiration.</p>
<p>Unlike its 60-80 hour JRPG peers, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is smaller in scope, despite its epic feel. After all, it's being made by just 30 people. Broche had a strong vision for the game from the start, with decisions like no online mode and no open world ensuring that vision remained achievable. What's more, advancements in technology can allow indie studios to achieve outstanding results.</p>
<p>"New technology allows smaller teams to do big AA 3D hits, whereas five or 10 years ago, it wasn't really achievable," said Meurisse. He cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a>, A Plague Tale and Mortal Shell as examples of smaller teams creating AAA-looking realistic games, but outside of these most indie studios previously had to use stylised or 2D graphics. "Now, thanks to new studios and new tools and great people, it makes a game like this very possible," he said.</p>
<p>And while the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass and was first revealed during an Xbox Partner Showcase, which Meurisse described as "the right opportunity to reach new players", he stated it's not considered an "exclusive partnership". "The most important thing for us is most people that would like to play the game, or would like to know about it, have the opportunity to play it," he said.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 24th April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Yup, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-in-april-leaks/">the leaks were spot on</a>: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> on 17th April 2025. Here’s Indy actor Troy Baker and Indy-like Nathan Drake actor Nolan North to string out opening a box:</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Date Reveal - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VdnmreE1X0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will be available physically and digitally, with a pre-order bonus being a The Last Crusade cosmetic bundle of travelling suit and lion tamer whip. It’s a first person game, and single player, so… uh… I guess you’ll get to see the whip sometimes?</p>
<p>Further to that,&nbsp; a Premium version will feature two days early access from 15th April, in addition to a Temple of Doom outfit, digital art book and an upcoming The Order of Giants DLC – the target release date for that DLC is yet to be announced.</p>
<h2>Further Reading: <a title="Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is best experienced as a serial, just like the films that inspired it" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is best experienced as a serial</a></h2>


<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft proudly proclaimed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/indiana-jones-hits-4-million-players-but-xbox-revenue-and-hardware-sales-fall/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has brought in over 4 million players</a> across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this was an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>It will also be fascinating to see how the game is catering to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> hardware, which will be significantly more powerful than the Xbox Series X. Full path tracing is likely off the table even with this spec bump – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">though it is supported on PC</a> – but with the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-set-for-april-22nd-launching-alongside-horizon-realms-update/">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5</a>, Playground Games is able to feature ray-traced car reflections during races and free roam, which was not possible on Series X. Some kind of visual uplift could certainly be on the cards for Indy.</p>
<p>Either way, this game should be on many a PS5-owner’s wish list. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1904186452851994817" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official PlayStation X account,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 on April 17th. The game is already available for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>We're not yet sure whether the PS5 version of <i>Great Circle&nbsp;</i>will feature any kind of DualSense haptic support, but given that the PS5 version of racer&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em><a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/39144665637651-Forza-Horizon-5-on-PS5-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does boast</a> some nice DualSense haptics, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect something similar from MachineGames' latest.</p>

The first three - namely&nbsp;<em>Pentiment</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves&nbsp;</em>- were announced for PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">back in February last year</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>would be coming to PlayStation, and rumors currently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">abound</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games could be about to get themselves PlayStation ports as well.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, it's a first-person action-adventure game developed by&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>studio MachineGames. The game casts you as (who else?) Indiana Jones, who's investigating a characteristically complex mystery involving a cat mummy.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones&nbsp;</em>game, you'll be visiting some pretty exotic locations throughout the course of the game, including Vatican City, Thailand, and more places besides.</p>




<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Great Circle&nbsp;</em>blends scrappy melee combat, stealth, and exploration, and it's spread across a series of hub levels with plenty of distractions and sidequests to pursue. If you haven't played this one yet, you're in for a treat.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on April 17th, and it's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/9n8fq28z6qx3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>Open world sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beta-decay">Beta Decay</a> is being delightfully greedy. The game's retro PS1-inspired art style hides some furious ambitions. It will be a "dystopian RPG where you can build spaceships, join factions, and fight for territory in a newly discovered star system," according to the Steam blurb. The game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beta-decay-is-a-low-poly-dystopian-rpg-whose-grimy-cover-shooting-shows-promise">previous trailer</a> showed some swish (if somewhat prototypey) cover shooter combat. But the game now plans to launch into early access this year, developers Rotoscope Studios have announced. And this time they've brought the big guns, literally. Mech some time for the trailer below. </p>

<p>Ah. That is some primo PlayStation 1 polygoning. There's no tight release date for this early access shooter, just a loose "2025". The open world survivalist combat is already looking more polished, a smog-smudged peek at the factional warfare the developers are promising, which will see corpo jerks and syndicate scum clash "in an endless fight for territorial control of the Alpha Centauri star system."  </p>
<p>What this looks like in practice is a lot of diving and ducking and blasting off limbs. Miniguns, sniper rifles, thermal goggles, VTOL aircrafts, weird dudes commanding legions of insectoid horrors. What's not to like? Just look at that dithering. I could run my finger across the screen and it would feel like a tea strainer. Ah, beautiful.</p>

<p>The game also plans to include a lot of other features, going beyond the firefights we see here. There are promises of survival mechanics that require you to eat, drink, and sleep. As well as the possibility of buying and selling goods (and even stocks) in a "player-driven" economy. Not to mention the spaceship tinkering.

</p><p>"Become an engineer repairing starships, a mech pilot commanding war machines, to a syndicate leader, executing raids deep within a labyrinthic neon city," say Rotoscope. "Trade products through physical shops on the streets to digital securities on the Centauri Exchange. Build spacecraft with complex sub-systems such as power grids, server networks, and life support systems to keep your crew alive in deep space..."</p>
<p>These are big promises for what looks like a small studio. Even one of these many features would constitute an entire game's worth of work. I'm also conscious of what happened last time I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-mommy-mechs-of-the-forever-winter-are-stomping-into-early-access-next-month">expelled litres of drool</a> over an apocalyptic mech-stomped warzone. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">much jankier than I'd hoped</a> (although to be fair it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winters-water-will-no-longer-drain-away-while-youre-offline">getting reliably updated</a> as its own early access continues). But never mind that. I am the mech appreciator. I live in a rusty state of eternal hope. I'll keep you informed of Beta Decay's progress.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've all heard the saying "everything has already been done once" when it comes to art and creativity. Fawzi Mesmar challenged this concept at GDC 2025, explaining that ideas can be repeated, but it's our own experiences that take a common concept and make it creatively unique.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the biggest hurdles in game development is coming up with a story. Whether you are trying to figure out the motivation driving your farmer in a cozy sim or flesh out the creepy world of a horror game, we are all aiming to be unique, original, and engaging.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An original and creative idea could be the key to a successful game. But what makes an idea original? Mesmar has some specific advice for those looking to harness creativity and get away from accidentally building a hollow repeat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="We are what we watch">We are what we watch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right from the start, Mesmar pressed listeners with the question "What is creativity?" He explained that the concept of creativity is often misunderstood as just "creating something." He instead broke it down as "an idea that is unprecedented." He stated that "what we do inspires us," and it is that inspiration that creates unique ideas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In game development we see trends as certain concepts with outsize influence on writers and designers. It is especially noticeable in newer devs, who may have set out to make a game solely because they were inspired by a specific title when they were younger.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p>Via ConcernedApe</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Via ConcernedApe</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the cozy genre, for example, it is a joke that almost every farming sim that has come out in recent years has a protagonist who is "trying to escape the big city" for a more provincial, relaxing life. This is due to how many cozy players were inspired by and grew up with games like Harvest Moon and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, just including the ingredients isn't enough. As we saw in the recent release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugardew Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, copying what works with other games isn't necessarily creative. However, titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have exploded in popularity, and have been celebrated for their creative and fresh elements. The difference between the two is how the developers injected their own personal experiences into the title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sugardew Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has all the right ingredients for a farming sim. Players can craft, farm, raise animals, and sell their crops and products. However, it lacks any depth beyond these core mechanics, leaving players bored and unsatisfied with the gameplay loop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> utilizes unique, 90s-inspired illustrations and anime-like plot points for its story while injecting adorable narrative elements like a "D&amp;D" tabletop game played at the pub on Fridays. It's original, unique, and charming, even if it has similarities to other farming sims.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The takeaway here is that a creative idea has to be more than just building a game around a selection of popular mechanics from other games. It needs depth, originality, and intention. Mesmar says that "originality is making something novel," and he has a key bit of advice for those trying to achieve this.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game designers need to create with intention">Game designers need to create with intention</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mesmar explained that "to achieve creative sobriety, you need to look into yourself and understand your own experiences and constraints."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do this, creatives need to look at a concept and think about how their own experiences in life could be applied to it. Instead of making a farming game where you plant crops and sell them, maybe you make a farming game where you have to teach NPCs how to help in the gardens, as you may have with a family member as a child. The game could be centered around building a thriving community garden and selling crops at a co-op or outdoor market. By diving into personal experiences, creativity blooms into original and unique concepts, even if they are based on something common and relatable.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-balatro-plays-winning-hand-at-gdca-2025-receiving-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Balatro' Plays Winning Hand at GDCA 2025, Receiving Game of the Year</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Mesmar says that "original ideas need to have value." You could have a core memory of petting your childhood cat, but does this experience have value? If you made a cat petting game, how would it connect or provide something to a player? If you have a core memory of petting your cat and you turn it into a hyper-realistic pet-groomer simulator or a platformer where the goal is to reach cats and pet them for points, now we are talking about originality. Who wouldn't want to fight baddies to collect cat pets like reward tokens?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creative Sobriety is about being intentional and thoughtful about the ideas we develop. Mesmar encourages those trying to harness their creativity to pause, think, and meditate on the why behind their ideas. By taking the time to consider how a concept connects with you and how it could be used to reach others, you will have the ability to craft truly unique and interesting stories.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/practice-makes-perfects-in-forestrikes-martial-arts-brawler/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Empire is under threat from within, and only the Order of Foresight has a chance to save it. The latest game from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/28/olija-review/">Olija</a> developer Skeleton Crew, Forestrike is a martial arts brawler where you can see the future… kind of. Coming to Switch and PC later this year, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2325930/Forestrike_Demo/">a demo is now available on Steam</a> to try and we’ve been hands on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forestrike | Leaf School Combat Overview | Play the First Demo on Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQvhBv8kTlc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You see, the power of Foresight is bestowed upon a select few, including our apprentice protagonist, Yu. When faced with a clutch of bad dudes that need defeating, Yu can only take a couple hits, but can enter into Foresight and unpick the chain of events that’s going to occur and how to turn it around in his favour. It’s a bit like he’s borrowed Doctor Strange’s time stone to have a peep at all the possibilities.</p>


<p>Foresight is basically a trial run, a practice arena where you can figure out the attacks coming your way and how to use your limited dodge, pickups and standard light and heavy attacks to defeat them. You’ll see what enemies emerge to surround you, and then learn to pick them apart one-by-one until you stand victorious.</p>


<p>If an enemy comes charging at Yu, he can engage a dodge mode that will pass that charing enemy straight through you and see them barrel into someone stood on the other side, dealing damage to both. Similarly, an enemy that is able to dodge can be tricked into using that either by a bullrushing enemy you’ve evaded or by triggering them with an attack for your own, opening themselves up for attack immediately after.</p>
<p>It’s essentially an action puzzle game where you need to try and figure out a path through and then execute your plan. Get it wrong and you’ll lose health pips or even die, sending you right back to the start of the game’s roguelite form.</p>
<p>The demo does a good job of slowly introducing you to these concepts before letting you go on a run and see the roguelite structure. Working your way from the countryside, through the mountains, the city and into the inner court of the Emperor, you’ll have a choice of levels to take on, many of which come with rewards and fresh abilities.</p>

<p>For example, one could make your light attacks spin enemies around, potentially disorient them to then turn and attack their allies. Or you could gain health from instances of friendly fire amongst them, or cancel out and steal their weapons. Levels that reward you with a new abilities present you with three to choose from, but others can also upgrade abilities – that turn-about ability can then stun enemies, if upgraded. There’s also a shop to spend coins – if not using those to open up a further path.</p>
<p>It comes to a head when facing a boss. Larger health bars, quickly recharging dodge abilities, and some audacious attacks – Master Ogai in the demo can tumble into one of his allies and just fling them at you – makes them a real task to figure out, come up with a plan and then pull it off. It’s not something that I managed in my exploratory run, despite well over a dozen efforts in Foresight.</p>

<p>The demo has one of Yu’s potential mentors, the old Master Talgun who pops up in your Foresight like a Jedi ghost and gives a little guidance. He rejects violence typically, but even he pushes for an attack-first principle in certain situations. He’s just one of a handful of masters that you’ll be able to choose from at the start of a run, each of which has a different school of combat, which you can master and ultimately combine.</p>
<p>For now, the demo provides a tasty morsel of the action that Forestrike will offer when it launches later this year. Unpicking the combat puzzles is sure to prove delectable to a particular cachet of players, ramping up to those ‘real’ battles where you have only one shot to pull off what you’ve been practicing, and leading to some gloriously slick combat sequences that would fit right into a martial arts movie.</p>

			<p>Multiple Xbox games will hit the Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation 5 consoles this year besides those that have already been announced, according to a new report shared online today.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release date announcement for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/">PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">stated</a> that 2025 will include a lot more titles appearing on PlayStation 5 and the next-generation Nintendo console. Which former Xbox console exclusives will make the jump has yet to be seen, but it wouldn't be surprising to see any of these games make an appearance during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has yet to reveal which games will hit rival formats next, there's a very good chance that Starfield will be among the next to release at least on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-release-imminent/">Earlier this month</a>, the console's logo appeared on Creation listings, suggesting that the game's announcement and release could be imminent.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Fable series could be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">multiplatform release</a> right from launch, as work on other console versions of the game has reportedly already begun. With the game having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/">delayed</a> to 2026, a multiplatform launch has become even more likely, although it remains to be seen how the Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to handle the game, given its lower specs compared to the other current-generation systems.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals esports scene is still in its very early days, but the early results have been very positive. The fledgling scene is attracting numerous organizations, strong viewership numbers (thanks to co-streaming), and some exciting rivalries.</p>



<p>The first competitive tournaments have featured plenty of highlights and trash talking, and there’s nowhere to go but up for Marvel Rivals esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-esports-is-heating-up-quickly">Marvel Rivals Esports is Heating Up Quickly</h2>



<p>After a month of action across the world, the Marvel Rivals Invitational series has ended, crowning five champions across each of the main regions. Arguably the most interest in Marvel Rivals esports has been in North America, which has attracted the most viewership and the most interest from established organizations.</p>



<p>Excluding the streamer-focused events like Creator Cup and Twitch Rivals, the Marvel Rivals event with the highest viewership peak was the NA Invitational that just concluded yesterday. The event <a href="https://escharts.com/tournaments/mr/marvel-rivals-invitational-north-america-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 71,099 concurrent viewers at its peak</a>, according to Esports Charts. This number was aided by co-streamers like Shroud, who has become so interested in Marvel Rivals that he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-roster-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded a team that competed in the event: Shroud-X</a>. But the event included a trove of larger organizations with dedicated fanbases: Sentinels, Envy, FlyQuest, and 100 Thieves.</p>



<p>100 Thieves have been dominating the competition in North America. Since the squad formerly known as Mutants signed with Nadeshot’s brand, they haven’t lost a single match, thanks in part to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-marvel-rivals-best-pro-tank-players-plays-on-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the few Vanguard players playing (and winning) on controller</a>. The rivalry between Sentinels and 100 Thieves in VALORANT has carried over to Marvel Rivals, complete with the<a href="https://x.com/MRivalsEsports/status/1903651194196676821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> expected amount of social media back-and-forth</a>. The trash talk is at the perfect level: not too far to be deemed personal or inappropriate, but above the basic level of normal banter.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty of room for Marvel Rivals to grow, but NetEase has committed to investing in the game itself for “10 years and beyond.” And with seasonal tournaments baked into the game’s competitive mode itself, that implies that esports will be a priority for years to come.</p>



<p>What do you make of Marvel Rivals’ aspirations in esports? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-berserker-khazan-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m exhausted after playing The First Berserker: Khazan over the past week and a half. My hands ache, my brain is fried, and I’ve often had to step away in frustration. It’s a brutally difficult game, one often expecting near-perfection in its toughest encounters. I’m slowly working my way through this Soulslike extension of developer Neople’s Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe, and it’s an understatement to say it’s given me trouble – which is part of why I still have a bit more to go before I’m able to call this review finished. But like a new military recruit, it’s broken me down and, over time, built me into a lethal weapon that’s prepared to take on whatever hellish nightmares wait ahead. Even though I’ve hit seemingly insurmountable roadblocks for hours at a time, I’ve somehow found myself enjoying and reveling in the battles that take me to the brink of my abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The First Berserker: Khazan is a classic revenge tale. Khazan, a celebrated general, is betrayed by his empire and labeled a traitor. After being gravely injured while apprehended, he is revived and possessed by a melded legion of vicious warrior spirits who antagonize him into doing their bidding. The Blade Phantom, as the ethereal symbiote is known, is more concerned with advancing the objectives of the underworld from which it hails, while Khazan is out for the blood of those who wronged him. The setup provides plenty to build on, tying grounded medieval politics to the occult forces leeching their way into the world, but the story after has mostly been thin and underwhelming beyond that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Khazan meets various characters as he ventures forth into the world, but besides adding some minor connective tissue to the ongoing plot, they don’t contribute to the story in a way that makes me care about really anything that’s happening. Distressed villagers, otherworldly advisors, former military cohorts, and more start to fill out a sparse hub area known as The Crevice. Outside of being visually interesting as a floating stone sanctuary with mysterious broken staircases and far-off platforms that I’d like to get to and explore, there’s not a lot to do in The Crevice apart from managing my inventory from time to time or pressing onto the next mission area. There’s shockingly little to glean from the greater world despite being the perfect place to slow things down and foster an environment for further flavor. Instead, it’s more a mechanical necessity to pick up optional quests or craft, upgrade, and augment gear for Khazan than an area to explore and enhance the overall story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being a well-honed instrument of war, Khazan has a handful of tools at his disposal to slaughter his enemies – although it took a long time before I felt like I was on his perceived level of capability. An early mission introduced me to The First Berserker’s three types of weaponry: You can choose to use the powerful but slow and defensive greatsword, a nimble stamina-draining spear, or the whirling assault of the dual blades. I enjoy how unique each weapon type is from the others, offering transformative move sets ranging from defensive and methodical to all-out aggressive. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Khazan feels way different than he did at the start roughly 40 hours ago. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each weapon is further expanded with a full skill tree that enhances Khazan’s effectiveness in battle. Nodes on these trees modify your basic attacks, like altering how your charged Potent Blow (or heavy attack) works, changing the stamina depletion for actions like dodging and blocking, or providing new moves entirely by spending a resource called Spirit Points in combat. My Khazan currently feels way different to play than he did at the start roughly 40 hours ago. There are a lot of options to kit out Khazan with as you level him up, and it’s been rather fun to figure out which moves and perks contour best to my playstyle to help me slice my way out of its hardening conflicts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The First Berserker lets you swap between your three weapons freely, but with little overlap between their various abilities, what’s normally a quick switch is actually a dramatic change and a hassle. For instance, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a>, most weapons boil down to having light and heavy attacks, with maybe a special ability available when switching to a two-handed grip. Weapons in The First Berserker, on the other hand, allow for up to six of the previously mentioned Spirit attacks and further optimization of the skill tree. It’s a lot to deal with when equipping what is essentially a bespoke class. That’s why I’ve dedicated myself to the dual blades during my playthrough, which I’m still tweaking and learning about with every big fight I pick. Thankfully, If I ever wanted to make the big jump to the greatsword or spear, you can reallocate skill points freely. However, the process is <em>just </em>obtuse and annoying enough to do on the fly that I’ve stuck with one kind of weapon throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon embarking on The First Berserker’s mainline missions, the structure is extremely similar to what’s expected in a soulslike. Each level involves slaying dangerous enemies patrolling the area, figuring out how to survive with limited healing items, collecting spoils of the dead, and using them to level up at this game’s version of a bonfire, called a Blade Nexus. It’s an overly familiar formula that’s certainly inoffensive in its design, with levels smartly built to weave back to prior respites via shortcuts. The First Berserker unfortunately doesn’t add anything that you haven’t already seen in FromSoftware’s games, but it recreates that loop well enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capping off each mission is a tooth-and-nail fight with that area’s boss, each of which represents a potentially substantial roadblock before you can continue to enjoy The First Berserker, but these encounters have begun to win me over. The first big encounter I struggled with was the end boss of Mission 2, a manifestation of souls like the ones inhabiting our newly possessed hero. Its aggressive melee attacks would quickly kill me, and after several unsuccessful attempts and unforeseen weapon swaps from my adversary, I needed to try another strategy to finally break through. Another early boss, a bipedal goat demon wielding a flaming spike and hammer, caused plenty of grief by hitting hard and often, occasionally lighting the battlefield ablaze with a carpet of flames. At first, I tried to grind weaker enemies around the level to collect Khazan’s version of souls, called Lacrima, to boost my stats and give myself a better chance of living. It helped, but ultimately didn’t do enough to tip the scales. I then took a close look at my gear and opted for a tankier build. Still no dice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What was once a peak point of frustration has become my favorite part of The First Berserker.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Khazan’s bosses are just painfully tough, and the early ones are like a brick wall. Some of the smaller enemies leading up to a boss will somewhat teach you how to deal with certain aspects of them, but there’s little to ramp you into what is continually asked of you moving forward. There’s no easy way to smash your way through these walls in The First Berserker, like finding an overpowered item or excessively juicing your stats. Even in a brutal game like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a>, a notorious early boss like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Margit_the_Fell_Omen"><u>Margit</u></a> can be overcome more easily if you spend some time getting stronger in the areas before him, but that’s not really an option here. In turn, this immediate difficulty spike genuinely made me want to stop playing after the first few levels – but I’m glad I stuck with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The process of learning each oppressive bosses’ moves and tells, figuring out when it’s ideal to dodge or block, is extra important in The First Berserker. It’s how I ultimately figured out how to enjoy the experience in the face of overwhelming odds. Honing these abilities was mind-numbing and shredded my will to play early on. There’s no way around the need to execute well-timed damage blocks or rolls and then strike back at opportune moments. Some bosses in the first half of the campaign burned upwards of five hours of my time alone, often leaving me wondering if <em>maybe </em>I should just consider dropping down from the default Normal difficulty to Easy to save myself the stress. These enemies tested my patience, but after overcoming that initial barrier,  building the foundation of my reaction options, and adapting my plan of attack, I became much more successful at figuring out the ones that followed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was once a peak point of frustration has become my favorite part of The First Berserker; the bosses are ultimately what make it worth playing. While they are incredibly hard to take down, every one can eventually be read like a book, telegraphing the moves they’re about to make and predictable strategies they’ll use throughout the fight. Every death that was once met with confusion and irritation has become a learning experience I look forward to absorbing. Every restart is a renewed chance to land my attacks and survive with newfound knowledge. Yes, there are plenty of cheap attacks, one-hit kills, and groan-inducing mistakes, but I’ve been enjoying studying each big boss I come across as much as the catharsis of finally taking them down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The First Berserker: Khazan Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve also been able to achieve these insurmountable feats thanks to two great quality-of-life decisions Neople has implemented into The First Berserker. First, dying repeatedly at a boss isn’t for nothing, but rather grants precious Lacrima based on how far you took their life down. Each upgrade that helps you afford gets you a little bit further the next time, and gaining levels by grinding the boss you need to beat is far more valuable than breaking away to farm elsewhere. Second, skill points are awarded separately from the levels you get from cashing in Lacrima, and are instead earned through a more traditional experience bar that is filled simply by being in battle. While not necessarily an increase in stats, unlocking new moves to use or enhancing your favorites can be just the thing needed to beat a stubborn encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After finally finding my footing with what’s being asked of me at the conclusion of each mission and gaining abilities that make me feel like I can stand a chance against anything, I’ve come to enjoy Khazan’s devastating bosses. They’re what’s keeping me trudging through largely uninteresting levels and hordes of enemies. It’s been a steep and sometimes demoralizing climb to feel effective with my skills and stats – but there’s also the exhilaration of executing split-second guards and dodges to escape relentless attacks and hit my foes with my own flurry of steel. If I weren’t reviewing it, there’s a very good chance I would have taken a long break early on, and who knows if I would ever go back. But now that I know I’m capable of taking on the worst Khazan has thrown at me (so far), I’m looking forward to seeing it to the end.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/forestrike-demands-absolute-unconditional-kung-fu-pixel-art-perfection-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a demanding, wizened kung fu master insisting you repeat a training exercise until you’ve gotten it exactly right, Forestrike shows no mercy, absolutely insisting you achieve perfection before proceeding to the next level. Despite being squarely centered on martial arts mastery, this pixelated 2D roguelike has more in common with a chess match than an action game, as you repeat encounters until you’ve perfected them in one of the most satisfying, unique, and immediately compelling brawlers I’ve played in a very long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wanted to live out your most epic kung fu fantasies where every moment plays out like you can see into the future, Forestrike very well might fill that need unlike any game has so far. The premise is simple: you’re a martial arts master who can enter your mind palace and practice each combat encounter as many times as you want before heading into battle for real. After a dozen or more rehearsals, even the most seemingly insurmountable scenarios went off without a hitch as I moved with the precision and speed of someone who knew every enemy’s move before they made it – because I quite literally had. And since this is a roguelike where just one or two mistakes will send you all the way back to the beginning, having that handicap is extremely important to success.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Forestrike Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In one level, I practiced again and again to resolve an encounter where I had to protect a traveling merchant from a band of ne’er-do-wells, and in another I challenged an extremely tricky boss who was annoyingly good at dodging, eventually beating him by getting his henchmen to accidentally hit him with friendly fire. Each level is its own miniature puzzle that must be solved and practiced before you try it for real, and even after all that, there’s always a chance your nerves will get to you and you won’t pull things off quite right, resulting in an untimely end to your journey.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you’ve got unlimited time to practice walloping the enemy in clever and creative ways, why not go beyond simply achieving victory and aim for a bit of flourish?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But sometimes beating your opponents isn’t enough – after all, when you’ve got unlimited time to practice walloping the enemy in clever and creative ways, why not go beyond simply achieving victory and aim for a bit of flourish? Sometimes this is incentivized via optional missions, like one where you’re encouraged to knock the hat off an enemy’s head, have it land on your own, then don’t let it get knocked off of your head for the rest of the encounter; those can be a great way to earn some extra gold for upgrades (like armor that will allow you to take one additional hit without ending your run) when you next find yourself at the shop. But if you’re like me, you also just might find it funny to see if you can get through an entire fight only using misdirection and dodging to get the enemy to kill one another.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The really crazy thing is I only played a little beyond the first of five regions, where encounters were still mostly on the simpler side, the number of unique enemies was fairly low, and I didn’t get to try out any of the other four fighting styles. Having gotten just a peek beyond that, it seems there’s a whole lot more in store, including some absolutely nutty looking encounters – like creepy banshee monsters that were introduced at the tail end and charged at me with reckless abandon. The demo I played also focused on the School of the Leaf fighting style, the first of five total schools you’ll be able to unlock and incorporate into your build, each of which has their own flavor and abilities you unlock on each run. The Leaf style is all about evasion and misdirecting enemy attacks to encourage friendly fire, and some of the abilities shown in the sizzle trailer that played at the end of the demo looked like they extended that idea to its logical conclusion – like by linking yourself to an enemy, then magically switching places with them when you take a hit. In a game that was already impressively clever in a short hour-long demo, I’m extremely excited to see what else the developers have got up their sleeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I have to mention just how beautiful and stylish Forestrike looks. Don’t be fooled by the pixel art simplicity! Animations are charming and detailed, character art during dialogue makes you forget they’re represented by pixels to begin with, and the music, sound effects, and overall presentation are absolutely unforgettable. I’m telling you, friends: this is one to watch!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to a former executive, the Nemesis system came about from trying to solve a different problem: secondhand sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f65WksXqA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new video</a>, Laura Fryer — former vice president of WB Games who oversaw the publisher's Seattle studios at the time — talked about her time with Monolith. While discussing the way trend-chasing affects the industry, Fryer mentioned that chasing trends is what "literally led to the Nemesis system."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, used game sales were a hot-button topic. Companies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/10/ea-sports-locks-out-multiplayer-modes-on-used-sales">Electronic Arts</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/18/ubisoft-to-tackle-used-game-sales">Ubisoft</a> were taking measures such as selling season passes to counteract an active used game market. Fryer said a sales drop-off for Rocksteady's Arkham Asylum was attributed, by analytics, to a theory that people would play the game, then return the disc to a retailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This was great for gamers, because they could buy the game and then sell it back to a company like GameStop and buy something else," Fryer said. "It was great for GameStop, because then they sold that used game for a discount and they pocketed the money. For game developers, though, it was a disaster, because they weren't getting paid for every game. They were only getting paid for the first copy sold. They lost millions of dollars."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where the Nemesis system, according to Fryer, came about. Faced with secondhand game sales and potential losses, how does a studio encourage players to hold onto their game? Memorable experiences, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With Shadow, we faced the same problem," Fryer said. "How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever? We knew Monolith's game engine wasn't yet capable of having a fully open world like a GTA, and this team wasn't interested in going the multiplayer route. But we still had to solve for the constraint. And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solving for this constraint would, as it turns out, lead to an incredibly memorable system of named Orc rivals, who would remember your actions and previous encounters, developing stories out of the action combat. It's often the best-remembered part of Monolith's Lord of the Rings duology, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios">with the sudden closure of Monolith Productions</a> and cancellation of its Wonder Woman project, that particular success seems doomed to life in the vault. Though the Nemesis system was due to be implemented in the Wonder Woman game, Warner Bros. still owns the patent for the system, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-mordors-brilliant-nemesis-system-is-locked-away-by-a-warner-bros-patent-until-2036-despite-studio-shutdown" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stands with an expiration date in 2036</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's fascinating to hear more about how the Nemesis system came together, even if it means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">further lamenting</a> the fact that it will gather dust for the forseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Shadows, which like Ghost of Tsushima is set in Feudal Japan, launched last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible">alongside a day-one patch that quietly made a number of important changes, including to temples and shrines</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update made tables and racks in temples and shrines indestructible, and changed citizens without weapons so they no longer bleed when attacked and thus reduce blood spill in temples and shrines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft told IGN the day-one patch was for all players and not Japan-specific, but was hard to see the changes as anything but a response to the controversy surrounding the game in the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That controversy even reached the upper echelons of Japanese politics. Last week, Shigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on"><u>responded to a question about Assassin’s Creed Shadows during an official government conference meeting</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin’s Creed Shadows question was asked by Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada. Kada, who will campaign for re-election this summer, said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life. Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Ishiba responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How to address this legally is something we need to discuss with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine being “defaced” in pre-release Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay videos was the Itatehyozu Shrine in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is within Kada’s constituency. He said that he had consulted with representatives of the shrine, who confirmed that Ubisoft did not seek their permission to show the shrine and use its name in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As our colleagues at IGN Japan explained to us last week, Japan has seen record numbers of overseas visitors in the wake of the country reopening its borders after the pandemic and the lure of the weak yen. In this government budget meeting the politician Hiroyuki Kada twinned his complaints against Shadows with the controversial subject of what he called “over tourism” and an attendant perceived rise in vandalism and graffiti in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His argument was that if players were able to deface a temple or harm individuals with a katana in the game, they may be inspired to do it in real life when they visit Japan, similar to the age-old argument that Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto inspire copycat violence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded that if such actions were taken in real life, he would oppose them. His comments were aimed at theoretical real-life copycat actions rather than at the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circles-ps5-release-date-will-be-announced-tomorrow-leaker-suggests">announcement today might have leaked</a>, but here's something you perhaps were not expecting - a skit featuring video game Indiana Jones Troy Baker, and Uncharted lead actor Nolan North.
</p>
<p>
Together, the two do their best to wring out 90 seconds of content from, well, the date written above. If you're a fan of Uncharted, or Trey, sorry, Troy Baker, this will likely raise a smile or two:

Alongside the game, a Collector's Bundle will be available with a physical game case (though you'll still need to download the game), an adventure journal book, a stone tablet replica, a globe (with hidden storage) and up to two days early access to the upcoming The Order of the Giants story DLC. Also included is a Temple of Doom outfit, and The Last Crusade travelling suit and lion tamer whip.
</p>
<p>Quite simply, PS5 owners are in for a treat - Indiana Jones was one of the best games of 2024, a brilliant and authentic-feeling adventure from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames, and probably the best Indiana Jones video game ever made.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, leaker billbil-kun said the release date announcement for the PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would take place today. Indeed, a few minutes ago, publisher Bethesda Softworks revealed that the acclaimed first-person adventure/action game released in December by MachineGames will debut on Sony's console in less than a month, on April 17.</p>
<p>Digital pre-orders are <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/?country-selector=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now open</a>, and physical pre-orders, depending on your region, are expected to be available soon. Users can choose from three options: the Standard Edition, available both digitally and physically; the Premium Edition, also available in both formats; and the retail-only Collector's Bundle.</p>
<p>All pre-orders will reward players with The Last Crusade Pack, which includes the Traveling Suit Outfit and the Lion Tamer Whip in-game items. The pricier Premium Edition also adds a Temple of Doom Outfit, a digital artbook, and access to the story DLC The Order of Giants, which has been confirmed to launch in 2025. The Premium Edition, just like the Collector's Edition, also provides two days of early access, allowing Indiana Jones fans to start playing on April 15.</p>

<p>The $199 Collector's bundle adds the following physical items to everything mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>An 11” Great Circle globe with a puzzle mechanic that unlocks a hidden storage compartment when solved</li>
<li>Allmaker Relic replica</li>
<li>Adventure Journal</li>
<li>Jumbo SteelBook display case</li>
</ul>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has been 'visually optimized' for the PS5 Pro, said Bethesda without going into further details. That info will likely be shared in the few remaining weeks ahead of the launch. By the way, the developers are also adding new whip abilities to the game, regardless of the platform you play on, with an upcoming free update. With “Open Season”, whip-cracking an enemy will temporarily cause them to take more damage from subsequent attacks, while when using “Sleight of Hand,” players can disarm an enemy and cause their weapon to fly Indy's way.</p>

<p>I found Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to be fantastic, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my review (9/10)</a> on PC:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
