The result is that only the Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which is now $20 a month, will include access to all Game Pass games. </p><p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the FTC writes</a></span>. It also points to a statement Microsoft made in its filings during the trial last summer suggesting Game Pass wouldn’t get more expensive just because Activision Blizzard’s games were added to it. </p><p>“Here, the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [<em>Call of Duty</em>] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition),” the company wrote at the time.

It’s not clear when a final decision in the appeal will be issued, and it’s hard to fathom what the consequences would be if Microsoft ended up losing. It would no doubt be even messier and more confusing than its Game Pass overhaul. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Paramount has canceled the Halo TV series on Paramount+ after two seasons; it has been announced.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Holly Reporter</a>), with Paramount+ offering a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work,” they said. “We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p>



<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, its sources say that Xbox and 343 Industries will look to land the series at another outlet for a third season if possible.</p>



<p>“We deeply appreciate the millions of fans who propelled the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;series to be a global success, and we remain committed to broadening the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;universe in different ways in the future,” reads a statement from 343 Industries. “We are grateful to Amblin and Paramount for their partnership in bringing our expansive sci-fi universe to viewers around the world.”</p>



<p>The Halo TV Series was received as a mixed bag by those who watched the show. Season 1 was generally poorly due to the show moving away from its source material, while Season 2 improved ratings slightly.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear where Xbox and 343 Industries could take the Halo TV series next, but Amazon Prime could be a strong contender following the success of the platform with the Fallout TV series.</p>



<p>Where do you think Halo will go? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>
As Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion inches ever-closer, Blizzard has shared first gameplay and details for its new Spiritborn class during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVUD8eLCFY">lengthy deep-dive livestream</a>.
</p>
<p>
In lore terms, the Spiritborn comes from the jungles of Sanctuary's Nahantu and is described as "an apex predator with a deep connection to the spirit realm". From a gameplay perspective, though, the Spiritborn is a dexterity focused class built around a spirit-infused martial arts move set - combining aspects of Muay Thai, taekwondo, karate, kickboxing, and boxing - that promises to make for Diablo 4's "fastest, most aggressive" class yet.
</p>
<p>
It has multiple gap-closers built into its basic attacks, several movement skills with "very high damage", plus various ways to upgrade its evades - and all its abilities are themed around four god-like Spirit Guardians that it summons during battle. There's a jaguar representing courage and ferocity; a massive centipede embodying balance and persistence; a giant eagle reflecting awareness and finesse, plus a gorilla that's a manifestation of protection and strength.

<p>
Breaking these down further, jaguar skills are all about speed and piling on constant pressure, and they generate a new stacking buff known as Ferocity through use. Ferocity increases the attack speed of all skills as it stacks, but also further enhances jaguar skills so they can be used more often.
</p>
<p>
The Ravager skill, for instance, has a passive effect that maintains Ferocity at a minimum level, but it can be activated to generate additional attacks when players hit something. Rushing Claw, meanwhile, is all about mobility, enabling the Spiritborn to dash and slash through targets over and over again, while the The Hunter is an ultimate skill that summons the jaguar onto the battlefield, destroying everything in the vicinity as it lands. This can even be upgraded for a chance to reset its cooldown after a kill to keep that kill streak growing. 
</p>
<p>
As for the gorilla, it offers a tankier skill set based around protection and defence. Its core mechanic is damage reduction through active blocking, all tied to the Resolve stacking buff, which reduces damage but falls off whenever a player is hit. Example skills include Crushing Hand, essentially two separate attacks that overlap in the middle and can smash enemies to bits, and Payback - which does increased damage the more something hits a player. Its ultimate brings in the gorilla itself, creating a large area on battlefield that grants protection while a player is in it, with the gorilla smashing enemies that stray inside.

<p>
Moving onto the giant eagle, its skills are all about freedom of movement, letting players tactically reposition themselves anywhere on the battlefield, increasing evade skills, even extend attacks into pseudo-ranged style moves. Soar, for instance, takes the Spiritborn up and out of battle for a second, then allows them to pick a descent position, amplifying damage to anything within it on landing. Then there's Razor Wings, essentially a boomerang-style throw attack, and The Seeker. This ultimate summons the eagle to a selected position, whereupon it'll charge up and unleash an upgradeable blast of energy. It's also the first ultimate with multiple charges, so it can be used back-to-back.
</p>
<p>
And finally, there's the centipede. This Spirit Guardian's skills are built around things like damage over time poisoning and crowd control, combined with sustaining elements such as the ability to leach life from enemies. Stinger, for instance, is a core skill that does a large amount of damage within a small area - but that damage also echoes out to poisoned enemies elsewhere on the battlefield. Scourge, meanwhile, adds fear, slow, and poison to enemies, and the Devourer ultimate summons the centipede to unleash a massive poison laser beam - which can be upgraded to instantly annihilate a poisoned enemy.
</p>
<p>
Notably, all these different skills can be mixed and matched for greater flexibility - although players can go down a single Spirit Guardian route if they'd prefer to specialise. This works through the new Spirit Hall class mechanic, enabling players to choose a starting Spirit Guardian as a primary bonus that'll boost all skills of that type, while also adding that spirit's tag to their entire skill kit for additional benefits. Later, it's possible to unlock three more bonuses so players can infuse more Spirit Guardian elements into their chosen playstyle.
</p>
<p>
And that's only the basics. Blizzard's deep-dive then showcases a few examples of Spiritborn itemisation, promising a large suite of legendaries and uniques for the new class. Expect more details on Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion ahead of its launch on 8th October.

Rather than wait until September, those attending Gen Con 2024 can buy a copy of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Player Handbook early. Furthermore, the books sold are limited-run commemorative editions; a must-have for collectors.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, Wizards of the Coast will be providing 3,000 early copies of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Player Handbook to Gen Con 2024.

Each book will be embossed with the 50th-anniversary logo in gold foil, featuring a "Gen Con 2024" bookplate. This distinguishes these copies from other first-run copies while celebrating fifty years of history and stories around the table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The energy at Gen Con is always electric. Being able to put copies of the 2024 Player’s Handbook, fresh from the printer, directly into players' hands on the floor of the convention is something truly special,” said Jess Lanzillo, VP of D&amp;D Franchise and Product at Wizards of the Coast. “We can't wait to see the excitement as our fans dive into the possibilities contained within!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are attending Gen Con 2024 and want to secure your copy of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook, </em>here's what you need to know. The books will be sold at the Lucas Oil Stadium, Northwest Concourse. They will be sold on August 1 between 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and August 2-4 between 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM EDT.</p>
<p>Each copy will be sold at an MSRP of $49.99 plus tax. At 7:00 AM EDT on each day, attendees can reserve an opportunity to pick up a copy. One simply needs to redeem a digital ticket for an event titled "D&amp;D 2024 <i>Player’s Handbook </i>Early Release Sale." Once it's secured, go to the line at the time and hours specified and wait to make your purchase.</p>
<p>Since only 3,000 copies are available, the books will be sold on a first come first serve basis.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-creator-correctly-holds-the-opinion-that-cs_siege-is-one-of-its-best-maps.931362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-creator-correctly-holds-the-opinion-that-cs_siege-is-one-of-its-best-maps<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Everybody knows that Counter-Strike's asymmetric levels are its best. If only someone had told its millions of players. Counter-Strike creator Minh Le seems to agree with me at least, naming cs_siege as one of his favourites in a recent interview.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"CS_Siege, cs_facility, were some of my favourite maps," Le told <a href="https://spillhistorie.no/interview-with-counter-strike-creator-minh-le/">Spillhistorie.no</a> when asked about favourites from the old days. "I also really wanted to love cs_747 but I think having linear maps was really bad for gameplay."
</p>
<p>Siege was one of the OG Counter-Strike maps, added in the first release, beta 1.0, back in 1999. It was the only one of the original four maps to make it all the way to the final release. Counter-terrorists start outside near a bridge over a ravine, while terrorists are entrenched in an underground facility with the hostages. Long sight-lines make it a sniper's paradise; there are some brutal chokepoints that favour the terrorists; and in the original game, the hostages liked to get stuck in doorways a lot.
</p>
<p>All of these elements just made it better. It was tense, and it had a sense of narrative to it. I like the Counter-Strike levels that pit attackers against defenders and makes one team an underdog, rather than sending two teams of sharks swimming along a de_dust log flume.
</p>
<p>Not that I dislike Dust. Neither does Le, by the sounds of it. "I think de_dust took all of us by surprise," he says. "We never thought it was that special when we first playtested it, but we were pleasantly surprised to see it become the standard Counter-Strike map. The mapper who made de_dust was extremely intelligent and spent a lot of time tweaking the design of de_dust to make it fun and balanced."
</p>
<p>Dust doesn't need the love, however, and Siege absolutely does. It was never among the original mod's most popular maps, and though the now 25-year-old map made an appearance in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, it has yet to reappear in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. Hopefully one day.</p>

SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's third-largest semiconductor company. They supply components for brands you've heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and sustained write speeds of 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and random write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, the SSDs have been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written.

The P41 Platinum uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips. </p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>God killing has become a staple in games starring Kratos, Bayonetta, Terra Branford, and countless other characters. With action-RPG soulslike Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, a new pair of god killers by the names of Nor and Enki joins their ranks. With a familiar tale about being wronged by the various gods of this world and becoming consumed by revenge, it never quite manages to reach the peaks of its peers, borrowing lots of elements from other genres without standing out in any of them. But while that keeps it from true greatness, Flintlock still continuously found ways to entertain me with flashy combat and swift movement across my 26-hour near-completionist run. </p><p>I was late to join the fan club that formed around developer A44’s previous game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/12/ashen-review">Ashen</a>, after its debut back in 2018, but it quickly found its way into my list of favorite soulslikes once I did, thanks in part to how enjoyable it was to vanquish its big bosses with a co-op partner. Six years later A44 is back with Flintlock, and while it may look vastly different from Ashen, a lot of the same foundation can be felt in its combat, storytelling, and overall design. That’s not to say it’s exactly the same, as efforts were clearly focused toward making the combat more brutal and cinematic with some really cool finishers while also introducing new mechanics like an experience multiplier that enhances the usual risk-reward tension of soulslike games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>Nor begins as a competent and headstrong soldier looking for glory that I would definitely classify as the “look before you leap” type, while her partner Enki is an adorable yet powerful god who has secluded himself from the world. He has his own reasons for joining Nor after her journey becomes one of revenge, assisting her with both his magical abilities and wisdom about his realm, and his an energetic and humble curiosity when learning of things he’s missed makes his part of the story by far the highlight. Unfortunately, Nor’s vengeful tale does occasionally fall into various cliches, and (avoiding spoilers) the minimalist cutscenes that occur from the perspective of another NPC that travels with them as you go between locations often feel like they are missing parts of the story. The bond that develops between Nor and Enki across their journey isn’t groundbreaking stuff, but watching them was still enjoyable to the end and did leave me curious what could happen next if Flintlock were to get a sequel.  </p><p>You only get a small bit of exposition at the start before you’re thrown into the middle of a war against the undead, but besides a big moment with a larger than life foe near the end of the prologue, this setup failed to give me a reason to care about the war or the people that I was fighting for. That’s mainly due to nearly all the NPCs being either reluctant or outright dismissive of Nor’s presence. The earliest hours of Flintlock are a bit rough in general as you have limited combat options, which can make fights feel much shallower and had me worried that it might not expand enough to become interesting. Thankfully, that changes once you gain access to more weapons and a few upgrades on the skill tree, but it took a bit longer than I would have liked. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat is fast and flows extremely well, chaining attacks with easy.</p></div><p>Aside from the main characters, four NPCs join your camp and assist by offering various upgrades to your weapons – but apart from one quest chain involving a brother and sister in the group, they were pretty forgettable. It was one of those situations where you meet characters in the opening hour and then they disappear, only to need saving or assistance hours later. If they weren’t placed on the main path, I probably would have written them off as dead and not thought about them again. On the other hand, the various NPCs you’ll come across through sidequests are more memorable: There were two brothers running an arena I could enter, and a, uh… unique character that increased my maximum health potions, offered information, and provided alternate outfits after liberating a town. </p><p>Combat is fast and flows extremely well; attacks chain into each other with ease and you can really feel the impact with each hit of your axes, hammers, rifles, grenades, and magical abilities that come courtesy of Enki. Flintlock also offers various armor pieces for you to find that provide unique abilities, like detonating enemies after stacking curses, splitting grenades into two, or increasing your attack range. These armor options all have set bonuses, so you’re encouraged to stack at least two of them for an enhanced effect, and that system expands with more interesting choices later on. </p><p>Enki has the ability to curse enemies, which stuns them and offers Nor the opportunity for a very flashy move that will either rip off armor or straight-up execute them, depending on the type of enemy and its health. Enki can also be upgraded to restrain, knock down, distract, and attack on his own, to the point where he often felt a bit <em>too</em> strong even when I was playing on the hardest of the three difficulties. I mean, he is a god, so I guess it’s fair, but in later areas I could take out entire groups of certain enemies with only his attacks. (I pulled this off thanks to a creative build that detonated an enemy after stacking four buffs within 10 seconds.</p><p>Top that off with super moves like a storm that knocks enemies up or a beam that deals major damage and stun, and I almost felt bad for them. This ended up being a great way for me to farm experience (called Reputation), since – similar to Devil May Cry and Bayonetta – you earn a temporary experience multiplier that is built up by fighting without Nor getting hit, and it’s hard for her to take damage when Enki is doing all the work. While it was challenging to amass a giant multiplier during the early game, after picking up more abilities and weapons to swap between I found myself routinely going past 100%, with my top being around 170%. But until then, that system encouraged me to use different weapons and variations on my regular combos in a way I haven’t seen done in a soulslike before. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sometimes Enki felt a bit <em>too </em>strong, clearing out entire groups alone.</p></div><p>There are some issues with the combo multiplier mechanic, though, and the main one is in enemy unpredictability. By that I don’t mean an attack that catches me off guard, causing me to miss a block or parry – those are par for the course across a decent variety of enemies, ranging from various undead creatures, knights with large shields or broadswords, large chocobo-shaped birds, spiders, and (of course) various gods. What’s troublesome is that there are a number of enemy attack animations that seemingly lock on to you, meaning that when dodging with either a standard dodge or by jumping away the enemy will swing around at a 90-180 degree angle and still hit me despite it looking like I should’ve gotten away. The good news is that I only saw this in fights with regular enemies rather than big bosses where it really would’ve been a problem. </p><p>You have three skill trees that improve your gun, magic, and melee damage, and their branches end up blending together as you approach the top of them. This structure allows you to bypass the lower upgrades on one tree if you want to prioritize certain upgrades over others, while still accessing its high-tier abilities eventually. I enjoyed this because I was able to fully spec into the magic tree early, which gave me the ability to have Enki suspend enemies in the air and, later on, provided a single self-revive that refreshed after resting. This was a godsend in the later boss fights, where one-shot kills aren’t uncommon – they’re avoidable and counterable, but accidents happen! After grabbing that skill at the top I simply bought the highest upgrades of the other trees before working my way back down to the cheaper options as I wanted them, instead of having to work my way up through ones I didn’t. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Flintlock’s tighter campaign length also means that nearly every path in the world leads to something impactful, and you can use Nor’s ability to double jump and air dash to find secrets like new weapons or health increases. There are also typically shortcuts to get you back to the main path quickly – these can either take the form of rest points you can fast travel to, or an interactable skull on a pedestal which activates energy rifts in the sky that Nor and Enki can fly to in quick succession. These rifts are flashy and versatile, and besides acting as shortcuts to return to your objective, they often offer a way for you to reach areas that would be otherwise inaccessible. They are probably one of my favorite mechanics in Flintlock as they are also placed to quickly get you back to a main boss or smaller boss-like enemies if you die. </p><p>Each open zone has a number of sidequests, with a majority of their objectives placed close to one another, making it easy to finish them all in quick succession and encouraging you to handle them as they pop up. There are a few exceptions to this rule: One quest had me scaling a mountain to find the daughter of an NPC who was unable to make the climb for their annual meetup, while another had me searching a mine for a worker that had gone missing. Many of the sidequests were simple yet enjoyable and often had twists, like a knight who offered to take his army and vacate their outpost if I defeated him in combat without using my gunpowder-based weapons – when I broke that rule during our duel, all bets were off. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Games where you kill God(s)</h3></p></div><p>Placed around the world are also various notes and signs that have a glow effect to let you know they can be collected, which are primarily in places you will visit when completing quests and offer varying degrees of insight into the world. There are also about 30 flags hanging across the first two zones that you can destroy for a Reputation reward, as well as a collectible when you’ve destroyed all of them in a zone. Compared to other RPGs, this relatively trim list of extras was a breath of fresh air since I didn’t have to worry about collecting hundreds of objects, baubles, or other collectibles, ultimately making me want to explore its world even more. </p><p>There is also a very fast and simple minigame called Sebo that is played by moving coins on a board to form a triangle within a limited number of turns while an opponent attempts to block you. These Tic-Tac-Toe-like matches rarely last more than two minutes each, and with every victory the amount of Reputation you earn increases, making strings of wins pay off bigtime. There is a bit of depth added as you progress in that boards and the starting locations of coins change, and new strategies form by finding special coins hidden in wells throughout the world that could offer the ability to swap coin locations, jump over coins, or form barricades to prevent movement. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>While the early hours are a bit rough, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is one of those soulslikes that only gets better as you get further in, unlocking more of the interesting skills that allow you to fully take advantage of its attack chains and XP multipliers. However, you’ll need to want to head off the beaten path to tackle sidequests, find optional fights, or interact with various NPCs to earn weapons and upgrades in order to get the most out of it. Thankfully, Flintlock respects your time while doing so with its use of shortcuts, fast travel, and other ways of making exploring fun and easy. It may have an abridged run time compared to other RPGs, but it makes good use of that time with interesting sidequests and an excellent minigame. Unfortunately, Flintlock’s story meanders a bit towards the middle and wastes a few opportunities that could have let its main characters shine, but this adventure did leave me interested to find out where Nor and Enki will go next. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-2s-chaotic-open-world-sequel-delayed-from-august-until-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It was just last month that we reported on Streets Of Rogue 2's early access release date, then planned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/do-a-drive-by-shooting-from-the-back-of-a-bear-in-streets-of-rogue-2-this-summer">for the middle of August</a>. Alas, the streets of video game development are meaner than first thought, and its release date has now slipped until October 22nd.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The reason for the delay? "I, uh.... couldn't program quite fast enough," says developer Matt Dabrowski <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/512900/view/4354501493553620254">in the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"While SoR 2 has had a few more folks working on it than its predecessor, I’m still the sole programmer/designer of this thing. Compared with other disciplines, programmers are notoriously bad at predicting how long a given task will take. Now replace 'task' with 'entire Early Access-ready game,' and as you can probably imagine, guesstimating correctly gets a tad trickier." 
</p>
<p>Pushing the release date later will allow Dabrowski and co to run a "large-scale pre-release playtest", which will be free for anyone to join. That's pencilled into the schedule for sometime in late August or early September.
</p>
<p>I've spent a decent amount of time in the first Streets Of Rogue, getting up to co-op mischief with a pal. The sequel is aiming for a maximalist expansion of the same kind of systemic chaos, swapping levels of modest size for a procedurally generated open world containing cities, islands, forests, caves, and driveable vehicles you can use to smash the aforementioned to bits. Assuming I can still wreak havoc as a vampire or zombie, I'll be happy.</p>

            I confess that 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</a> is a corner of the grim dark far future with which I'm unfamiliar, but it turns out it's an Orky death rally. Its video game adaptation, meanwhile, is a free-to-play, multiplayer, with several team-based modes. It now has an Early Access release date: August 6th.

<p>Speed Freeks has several modes, including Kill Konvoy, in which two 8-player teams compete to speed along their teams Stompa and slow their enemy's. A stompa is what it sounds like. There's also Deff Rally, where teams of 8 drive and fight to capture points. I hope there's at least one mode that is about, y'know, normal racing, but it's unclear from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078450/Warhammer_40000_Speed_Freeks/">Steam page</a> whether "Intense Racing" is a proper noun.
</p>
<p>There have been open alphas and open betas for the game already, but Speed Freeks will launch in Early Access and spend a few months there, launching in full later this year. The final version will add a "new map, new vehicle, new features and enhancements," and it'll still be free-to-play.
</p>
<p>If you're looking for an avenue of commerce here, I'm guessing it runs through the vehicle customisation. Kits, rims, tires, and of course paint jobs can all be modified, while real money can be spent on virtual currency you can exchange for in-game items. 
</p>
<p>Has there ever been a truly great game about vehicle combat? One where the combat involves projectile weapons, not playing bumper cars, I mean? I'd argue cars are an awkward steed to ride into battle, but what do I know. I prefer Split/Second to Blur, so I'm immediately thrown through the front windscreen of this discussion.</p>

There’s something about a wave going “whoosh” that makes my brain go “brr.” While you all studied the blade, I studied the cresting of waves in <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. While you all racked up killstreaks in <em>Call of Duty</em>, I was racking up laps in the swimming pool on top of that one building in <em>Uncharted 2</em>. You know the one. And now that <em>No Man’s Sky </em>is stepping up its water game, I’m about to be studying alien waters like it’s my goddamn job.</p><p>There’s something about the fact that the sea, in all its mystifying expansiveness, can be captured by games now. Due to that, <em>No Man’s Sky’s </em>once-placid waters have come to life, and its immense universe feels <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-worlds-5-0-patch-art-graphics-ps5-sale-1851596991&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-worlds-5-0-patch-art-graphics-ps5-sale-1851596991">even bigger and more vibrant now</a></span>. Thanks to its 5.0 update, oceans now sway more realistically and generate waves. They have reflections and react to your ship skidding just above the surface, as well as to weather. You can now land in water, which makes it all that easier to dive in and explore the depths of the ocean, which was the subject of a past update to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.<br></p><p>I’ve been fascinated by video game water for as long as I can remember. Since the moment I first drowned in games like <em>Sly Cooper </em>or <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>, they’ve been a point of fascination. Maybe it’s because I was taken with the beach as a kid, and loved to swim, or more appropriately, loved to ride on my grandmother’s back and pretend I was swimming. Perhaps it felt odd that games couldn’t reflect this pastime I loved so much. Either way, I loved trying to swim in games, especially when bodies of water felt like a boundary that I wanted to push on.</p><p>These days, the ability to traverse water is far more commonplace in games. As such, the impetus behind water in games has shifted. Whereas they used to be a boundary to stop you from doing something that wasn’t technically possible, bodies of water are now vehicles for incredible technical showcases. They now exemplify what <em>is </em>possible.</p><p><em>No Man’s Sky </em>now feels real. Watching the waves be tugged on by storms makes it feel expressive. <em>No Man’s Sky </em>now houses a universe worth exploring if only to see how wave patterns vary depending on the environment and time of day. The ocean has now become another way to measure how unique and grand an experiment <em>No Man’s Sky </em>is, and folks, I think I hear its siren calls. If this is what we can expect from <em>Light No Fire</em>, which aims to simulate an entire world in vivid detail, I fear it may be over for me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for most players, tracking down and harvesting resources such as tin in <em>Once Human</em> may prove challenging and, unfortunately, confusing. </p><h2 id="h33066"><a id="need"></a>Why you need tin ore in Once Human</h2><p>Multiple crafting and construction recipes in the game require tin, with the most notable being Bronze Ingots.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-is-the-playstation-5-pro-releasing-in-2024.931287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The latter half of 2024 is finally here, and questions have begun to emerge a lot more frequently about the PlayStation 5 Pro’s future. Is it still happening? Will the PS5 Pro be released in 2024? When will the console be revealed? Etc.</p>



<p>Admittingly, the more recent discussions about the PS5 Pro missing its holiday 2024 release have been fueled by <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1813546361872347328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">my own tweet</a>. People understandably took a relatively passive comment as if I was implying the Pro would miss its holiday 2024 release or be canceled entirely, but that isn’t the case as of the time of writing.</p>



<p>Developers can submit their applications supporting the PlayStation 5 Pro to CertOps (Platform Certification &amp; Operations) on July 30th, a date understood to have been finalized as far back as 18 months ago. In addition, all applications for the PlayStation 5 on games that will be released after September 15th will be required to support the PlayStation 5 Pro (this does not mean the PS5 Pro will release on September 16). So, although not an exact release date, the information, which was released by PlayStation earlier this week to developers, suggests that the PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track to be released later this year. </p>



<p>Documents sent to me in mid-2023 showed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-release-date-plans-and-console-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro release date</a>, which, if memory serves me correctly, was in the latter half of November 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the Pro seemingly being on track, several sources have been apprehensive about the console’s release later this year, primarily due to the limited number of first-party games that will use its features. However, regarding documentation (90-95% of my reporting involves documentation sources), nothing implies that the PS5 Pro has been delayed or canceled.</p>



<p>Officially, PlayStation has yet to confirm or acknowledge the existence of the PS5 Pro publicly. Still, developers are working hard behind the scenes on the PS5 development kits, with PS5 Pro Testing kits also being distributed this Spring.</p>



<p>As for when the PS5 Pro will be announced, it will likely fall in line with the PlayStation 4 Pro marketing announcements, which saw the console announced in September. As many people in the community pointed out, Sony is set to be at the Tokyo Game Show (TGS) in September, making it the first time the company has been at the show in five years. If the PS5 Pro is announced at the event, it will remain to be seen, but I speculate that Sony/PlayStation could be at the show to talk about the Pro and its features and reveal it earlier in the month instead.</p>



<p>When do you think the PlayStation 5 Pro will be released? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo IV Spiritborn Class Revealed in Blizzard Livestream]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream.931260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been over a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the release of Diablo IV</a>, while the Vessel of Hatred expansion was <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gets-october-date-new-cinematics-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at BlizzCon 2023. Today, an official livestream shared the first details on the upcoming brand-new Spiritborn class.</p>
<p>Spiritborn hail from Nahantu, a brand-new area players will explore and campaign through in the DLC. They can swap between the realm of the living and the spirit realm. Their mission is to sustain the harmony between Sanctuary and the Spirit Realm. However, for young, living Spiritborn, stepping into the Spirit Realm is not recommended, as it is a dangerous journey predominantly left to the elders.</p>
<p>In this<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVUD8eLCFY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> live stream</a>, players see a trailer of the Spiritborn and how they came to be. Additionally, you get to witness their combat style. The Spiritborn utilizes martial arts and can also connect with Spirit Guardians and summon them to fight alongside you in small bursts. Depending on what abilities you are focusing on, it can change your fighting style completely.</p>
<p>Depending on the Spirit Guardian, it can change how you deal your damage. As explained in the live stream by Art Director Nick Chilano, they all have unique fighting styles. The Gorilla uses blunt force damage and is intensely strong. The Jaguar utilizes cleave attacks, multi-hit combos, and agility, and the Centipede uses open-palm strikes and applies poison. Finally, the Eagle is a precision-based guardian who focuses on repositioning on the battlefield as and when needed.</p>
<p>With the addition of the Spiritborn, Diablo will see a mount that isn't a horse added to the game. There will also be the addition of pets, where you can get the Alkor Snow Leopard, Hralti Canine, and Natalya the Tiger pets.</p>
<p>During the live stream, the developers showcased some of the abilities players can expect to see and utilize when experimenting with the Spiritborn. Unlike some other classes available in Diablo IV, Spiritborn will be a highly agile, fast-attacking class, regardless of what Guardian you use.</p>
<p>This will become an ultimate ability for those who want to see their Spirit Guardian on the battlefield. While you may catch glimpses of them in your abilities, they will instantly be summoned to your side once you cast your Ultimate.</p>
<p>Going for a Jaguar (Rezoka) build will have fast-paced attacks, multi-attack combos, and plenty of fiery flair. Players must focus on attack speed to get as many cleave attacks as possible to get the most out of the Jaguar. Additionally, the Jaguar provides a buff that will increase attack speed to all Jaguar abilities, give them even more power, and reduce cooldowns to allow you to use abilities more often. One of the primary Jaguar skills showcased in the live stream is an ability called "Rushing Claws," where the player will dash through the target and slash at everything in its path. Rezoka's abilities all do Fire damage.</p>
<p>The Gorilla (Wumba) focuses its energy around protection and is a slightly tankier build than some others. You'll be able to retain the damage taken, buff your attacks using it, and return it to the enemy. The primary attribute of the Gorilla is damage reduction. An example of one of the primary abilities of the Gorilla is called "Crushing hands," which is very self-explanatory. It crushes all enemies on the spot in a small circle. Wumba's abilities do physical damage only.</p>
<p>The Eagle (Kwatli) is a highly agile guardian who enables freedom of movement with dashes, blinks, and more. Its primary attribute is movement speed. One of the main abilities of the Eagle is "Soar," which allows you to pick a target area to fly to, come down on enemies, and apply Vulnerable to them to enhance your attacks. Kwatli's abilities do Lightning damage.</p>
<p>The Centipede (Balazan) is about persistence and applying poison where possible. This build is one to look out for if you like damage-over-time builds and applying stacks of poison. In addition, the Centipede can also leech health back off of their enemies. One of the primary abilities of the Centipede is called "Stinger," and it causes a large amount of damage in a small circle area. However, it has the unique concept of pseudo-range, which can also echo damage onto nearby enemies who have been poisoned. In the live stream, Centipede's primary attribute is not mentioned. Balazan's abilities inflict Poison damage.</p>
<p>Each Spirit Guardian has their own key passive, which can help you decide on what build you want to choose and allow for a wider range of flexibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eagle: 30% Movement Speed</li>
<li>Gorilla: 30% Damage Reduction</li>
<li>Jaguar: 30% Attack Speed</li>
<li>Centipede: 30% Life Steal</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spiritborn class in Diablo IV is shaping up to be one of the most in-depth classes in the game, offering a wide range of abilities and ways to play the new DLC for those excited to get stuck into Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, the DLC releases on October 8, 2024. Once immersed in Nahantu, Spiritborn will have a class quest to complete, which unlocks the Spirit Hall, which is the brand-new mechanic for Spiritborn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Vessel of Hatred | Spiritborn Reveal [English]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjVUD8eLCFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Utilizing the Spirit Hall will allow players to deepen their connection with the Guardians of their choice. You can select one as your Primary Spirit and either choose the same spirit again or a different Guardian for your secondary spirit at level 30.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-spiritborn-class-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It doesn’t take all that much to get me to dive back into Blizzard’s stellar ARPG, Diablo 4, which has had a fantastic run of seasonal content and updates in the year since it made its devilish debut. But after an extensive hands-on with its upcoming character class, the Spiritborn, I might be kissing my free time goodbye altogether. This jack of all trades impressively mixes up the Diablo ecosystem with its most customizable and varied class yet, opens up a whole new unexplored aspect of Diablo lore, and most importantly, lets you summon a giant spectral gorilla to Hulk-smash demons into pink giblets. By the end of my time exploring Vessel of Hatred’s spooky jungles and dark dungeons, I was ready to forsake my roguish ways and declare myself a Spiritborn main, and that’s no small feat.</p><p>A quick housekeeping note: my time playing Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred was focused almost exclusively on the Spiritborn character class. After choosing my preferred Spiritborn warrior, I was dropped right into the action in the new region of Nahantu to craft my build and dismember everything in sight. Though all of the following things are in there, I didn’t see any story, meet any NPCs (aside from vendors), or get to check out the new hireable mercenaries feature. That said, my access to the Spiritborn class and all it offers was pretty exhaustive, so I’ll be focusing on that. Let’s dive in!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Spiritborn are an entirely new class to the Diablo series, complete with their own lore that’s tied up in the ancient civilization of Nahantu – as seen in the Act 3 jungles of Diablo II – and the ethereal spirits with which they commune. Unlike the other Diablo IV classes, where you dive quite deep into a specific fantasy like tanking with the Barbarian or doing mad DPS with the Rogue, the Spiritborn is much more customizable and varied, thanks to the four guardian spirits you can choose to build into. Those four spirits are: the eagle, which focuses on mobility, evasion, and lightning damage; the gorilla, which is all about survivability and physical damage; the jaguar, which is the king of DPS, attack speed, and fire damage; and my personal favorite, the centipede, which uses poison, debuffs, and lifesteal to control the battlefield and feed off your foes’ misfortune.</p><p>Each of those spirit guardians is represented by a massive ghostly avatar that imbues you with power and occasionally takes to the battlefield itself to lay waste to your enemies, like how the centipede bursts onto the scene to start spitting giant globs of venom at everything in sight, or the eagle, which swoops in to zap your foes into dust. The skills and abilities that correspond with each of these spirits appear on the Spiritborn skill tree as color-coded nodes, so you can easily identify which you might want to focus on depending on your chosen spectral BFF.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These four distinct styles, and the divergent builds you can create from them as a result, make the Spiritborn feel like four new classes in one. For example, a slow-moving, extremely resilient gorilla build will feel very different from a jaguar build where you’re teleporting around the map. But although you’ll need to choose one of them to be your primary patron, one of the most defining characteristics of the character class is the ability to hybridize your build with some of the powers offered by other guardian animals. So, for example, if your jaguar build is feeling a bit squishy, you can reach across the aisle to your gorilla spirit and add a few of his tanky abilities to your repertoire, making yourself significantly more durable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The four distinct styles, and the divergent builds you can create from them as a result, make the Spiritborn feel like four new classes in one.</p></div><p>That’s a whole new ball game from the much more specific fantasies the other character classes offer, and at first I was worried that would make it feel like a jack of all trades and master of none. But the longer I played, the less I was concerned about the class feeling underpowered, as I went deep into a centipede-eagle (centipeagle?) build that had me filling the battlefield with life-sapping poison, then dashing out of reach when things got too hot. “You would think that it would have some kind of identity crisis, but if you play the build it doesn't – it works,” Diablo IV Game Director Brent Gibson told me. “And I think the team has done a great job at picking the right things inside of each of the lanes that make it so unique and distinct without trying to turn it into giant cream corn.” From what I’ve played so far, I tend to agree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After trying out half a dozen different builds, I’m very much sold on this extremely unorthodox class, and I really got a kick out of how different each of the spirits felt and how flexible the class was in allowing me to take on different roles depending on my current need or flight of fancy. It remains to be seen if any of these builds will be able to compete with the five existing and much more focused classes, but so far I’m really encouraged by what I saw, and have a feeling I’ll be running as a Spiritborn exclusively when I tackle Vessel of Hatred later this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those who have put in some time into the Nintendo spinoff franchise might have noticed that Earth can be seen below some versions of Rainbow Road in-game. Mario Broth offers an in-depth analysis of the size and location of both the Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart Wii iterations of Rainbow Road, revealing that they both cast shadows over very different parts of the planet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mario Kart Wii's and Mario Kart 8's Rainbow Roads are both depicted as floating above the Earth. By examining the skyboxes, we can map their real-world locations.

Quebec and Nunavut get the most coverage, with the starting line placed just above the former. Mario Kart 8, meanwhile, seems to be positioned above the Mediterranean Sea and Tyrrhenian Sea, centered between Sardinia, Sicily, and Tunisia.

Meanwhile, Nintendo’s Mario Kart series is currently between releases. The last numbered entry arrived on the Wii U in 2014, though Nintendo’s managed to make the most of that experience with a Deluxe re-release for the Switch in 2017. A long list of DLC additions have since arrived over the course of the last few years via the Booster Course Pass, which wrapped up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-8s-final-wave-of-booster-course-pass-content-lands-next-week"><u>its final wave of content late last year</u></a>.</p><p>There’s no word on when another installment will appear.

She’ll be available to play for a limited time from July 19 through July 21.</p><p>Juno, then known as Space Ranger, was first teased at Blizzcon 2023 alongside Venture. At the time, all players could gleam about Juno’s abilities was that she was armed with a blaster and Death Stranding-esque shoulder attachments to her space suit. Thanks to her gameplay trailer, we know they aren’t just for show. In fact, they can target heal her allies, and attack her enemies. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s Blizzard’s official breakdown of her abilities:</p><p>"Juno is equipped with Pulsar Torpedoes that can lock onto multiple targets. Her Glide Boost ability allows her to swiftly maneuver the battlefield to provide critical support wherever she’s needed. Juno's Hyper Ring propels the team into action, while her Ultimate Orbital Ray boosts damage and replenishes health."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Juno is one highly mobile Martian 🛸👩‍🚀</p><p>💥 Primary Fire: Mediblaster<br>🎯 Secondary Fire: Pulsar Torpedoes<br>💫 Abilities: Glide Boost &amp; Hyper Ring<br>🚀 Ultimate: Orbital Ray</p><p>Check out her kit and try it out for yourself during her limited-time trial July 19 through July 21 ✨ <a href="https://t.co/OenFBF5R2X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OenFBF5R2X</a></p></div>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1813974518924230984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1813968475674861771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>separate tweet</u></a>, Blizzard also revealed Juno’s voice actor, Xanthe Huynh. You might’ve heard Huynh’s voice in anime and video games like Alluka Zoldyck in Hunter x Hunter, Haru Okumura in Persona 5, Haruka Sawamura in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and Inutade and Fleki in Delicious in Dungeon. </p><p>“We’re SO excited to have her in the game and can’t wait to hear even more Juno,” Blizzard wrote. </p><p>Juno’s arrival also bolsters the free-to-play hero shooter’s roster a tad more in favor of its support players. As of the time of writing, Overwatch 2 has 12 tank characters, 18 attack characters, and 10 support characters. Hopefully, once Juno is fully integrated into the game, support mains will find her added mobility and her orbital laser-esque ultimate ability will give both seasoned and newbie healers a much-needed assist pushing the payload. </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in interesting times, even if many of us wish we didn’t. On Saturday, a shooter attempted to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/possible-shots-fired-at-trump-rally-in-butler-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take the life of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>. Milliseconds later, the internet was awash with memes making light of the situation. This clockwork cycle plays out following almost any event of significance; the modern internet has been engineered for it. But the attack on Trump has backed companies behind games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Roblox </em>into an odd corner. Memes are one thing, but full-on recreations of the moment in iconic game settings are something else.</p><p>The past few days have seen recreations of Trump’s brush with death circulate in and around multiple games. Whether in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?lang=en&amp;q=trump%20fortnite&amp;t=1721158876652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://x.com/shitpost_2077/status/1812566883951915435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search/video?lang=en&amp;q=trump%20roblox&amp;t=1721158888735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Roblox</em></a>, the most popular clips – which have amassed <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brazquil/video/7391641361079864582?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7342598075528398379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands</a> or in some cases <a href="https://x.com/TheCumpound/status/1812889886841520472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of views</a> – all tend to take the same form: visuals of a game character futilely sniping a recognizably Trumpian target while a digital audience looks on and real-life audio of the incident plays. These clips are adorned with text like “Bro’s aim is so bad” and “Trump rally be like.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the kind of thing that shocks for a split second by catapulting a violent political event into a candy-colored playpen before almost immediately receding into the back of your mind, more grist for the endlessly churning meme mill. But these videos also rely on popular, kid-friendly games’ characters and settings, and what they depict is against those games’ rules.&nbsp;</p><p>“Depictions of real-world violence are clearly prohibited by our Support-A-Creator rules and the creator of the video has been actioned accordingly,” an Epic spokesperson told Aftermath in response to <a href="https://x.com/TheCumpound/status/1812889886841520472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a popular video</a> I asked the company about. “We’ve also confirmed that the island shown in the video was never publicly available (published) in <em>Fortnite</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, according to <a href="https://globalextremism.org/post/fortnite-to-platform-violent-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report</a> from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fortnite-has-a-political-violence-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>), multiple player-made attempts at a "Trump vs Assassin" game type appeared in <em>Fortnite </em>following the assassination attempt, before being removed by Epic. Additionally, the organization was able to find numerous other player-created islands that propagated political violence, racism, and antisemitism, many of which it reported and some of which remain accessible despite that.   </p><p>A spokesperson from Roblox Corporation replied similarly to Epic, noting that creators can use the company’s Roblox Studio tool to create scenarios that they don’t actually publish, which then serve as fodder for these sorts of videos.&nbsp;</p><p>“While we value friendly debate about issues and topics that matter to our community, we prohibit the discussion or depiction of certain political content in order to maintain a civil and respectful environment,” the spokesperson told Aftermath, noting that prohibited topics include current candidates running for political office, sitting elected officials, political parties, and flag burning. "Many developers use Roblox Studio, our free application to create an experience, and don’t publish on Roblox platform, but often share the experience/gameplay on social media platforms."</p><p>Roblox will intervene in some cases where off-platform behavior is especially egregious, the spokesperson added: "If a developer created content in Roblox Studio that violated that policy – for example, making a credible real world threat and then posted it to another platform – Roblox can take action."&nbsp;</p><p>The spokesperson also noted that ten percent of Roblox Corporation’s full-time workforce – plus “thousands” of contractors – are dedicated to content moderation, a net which is meant to prevent experiences that center around real-world political figures, among other things, from slipping through. But <em>Roblox</em> has <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 70 million daily active users</a> spread across over 5 million experiences. Sometimes rule-breaking experiences manage to make the cut, including – among others – one about the JFK assassination, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjEjU9uFUhk&amp;t=470s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlighted by YouTuber Schlep</a> late last year. The Roblox spokesperson told Aftermath that the JFK experience is no longer accessible. As of yesterday evening, a small handful of Trump-themed experiences existed on the platform, but they did not appear to focus on the assassination attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft, which owns <em>Minecraft</em>, did not reply to a request for comment.</p><p>This all rests against a backdrop of companies and institutions <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awkwardly fumbling to figure out</a> how to talk about the attempt on Trump’s life. Democrats have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/after-trump-assassination-attempt-biden-campaign-pauses-ads/story?id=111930384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paused campaign-crucial efforts</a>. Tenacious D <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/jack-black-cancels-tenacious-d-tour-trump-assassination-kyle-gass-1236073486/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a tour</a> after a joke from one of its members. Kick, the Twitch rival typically known for its almost-anything-goes approach to moderation, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/kick-bans-streamer-destiny-for-hate-speech-after-trump-shooting-backlash-2827880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned controversial streamer Steven “Destiny” Bonnell</a> following inflammatory comments about Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died at Trump’s rally</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The responses from Epic and Roblox Corporation paint a similar picture: Companies, despite providing the tools that form the backbone of these videos, largely believe themselves responsible while creations are within their games’ ecosystems. This makes a degree of sense, as even massive companies cannot be everywhere at all times. However, with engagement-thirsty platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube seemingly uninterested in damming up these streams of content, we end up in an odd spot where <em>nobody </em>is wholly responsible for videos that use popular IP to recreate the attempted murder of a former United States president and current presidential candidate. Game companies could probably cease-and-desist offending material if they really wanted to, but so far, it does not appear that any have opted to do so.</p><p>That’s not to say that somebody <em>should </em>be in a position to unilaterally do something about video game recreations of the assassination attempt. Online platforms continue to struggle to figure out where to draw the line when it comes to political content, with many <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240737627/meta-limit-political-content-instagram-facebook-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opting to suppress it</a>. Meanwhile, the United States government keeps on pushing a TikTok ban for reasons that register as Awfully Sus whether you view them through <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lawmakers-tiktok-ban-pro-palestinian-content-1235016101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/24/tiktok-ban-benefits-meta-google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">economic</a> lenses. By comparison, some meme-y videos of a blocky Donald Trump ducking behind a podium – or in particularly minimalist interpretations, nothing – are the least of our problems. And while one could make the argument that this kind of content further raises the heat of the political cauldron that boiled over into last weekend’s assassination attempt, that’s fixating on a symptom rather than the root cause, which is – <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Riley recently put it</a> – “the Right’s violent rhetoric looping around to bite them in the ass.” People should be able to discuss these issues freely, even if only to joke about them.&nbsp;</p><p>We're not in open-season territory here, however. Companies have a responsibility to proactively take down content that is hateful in its aims or associations, like the kind uncovered by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism in <em>Fortnite</em>, lest it be used to lure young users down the internet's darkest corridors. On this front they have routinely come up short, over-relying on user reports and broad rule sets that fail to catch savvily-packaged hate.</p><p>For the time being, at least, games will remain a thread in the larger tapestry of our engagement with these escalating events. People are stuck on a ride they desperately wish would stop or at least slow down, powered by online engines designed to siphon away negative feelings and turn them into fuel for a machine that exists simply to devour more fuel. So people rage at their own powerlessness – or just gawk, for fun – in the language of the time: nihilistic memes. As The New Yorker's Kyle Chayka recently <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-trump-assassination-attempt-meets-the-internets-brain-rot-era?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR11cMlY7UcXR8pnMNnBKKIFcJuy77JbOP_3LI4iy6hmxPCgdvNYLHihGe8_aem_lj5pNBNqheOq9SGZTYUGiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described the phenomenon</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"The form of the content — its production value and valence, like a subatomic particle’s spin — surpasses the underlying raw material. The attempted assassination of a former President is treated with the same catholic flippancy as a pop album or a Chinese glycine factory’s ads. … The result is not quite satire; it is absurdism without insight, our new lingua franca online. What qualifies as important is inextricable from what goes viral, and vice versa. ‘Brat summer’ has the same weight as an act of political violence, and thus the two are inevitably mixed to create something even more clickable. Meaning matters less than recognizability, the split second of understanding the joke."</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>But some with years of experience creating memes argue that meaning does still matter, that memes can outlive their moment. In the days following the assassination attempt, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/507010/MrPresident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2016 game called <em>Mr President!</em></a> – in which you play as a bodyguard attempting to fling themselves in front of sniper bullets hurtling at a “bankrupt billionaire” who is obviously Donald Trump – received hundreds of new Steam reviews. “This game aged amazingly,” reads one. “Well damn,” reads another.</p><p>At the time of its release, <em>Mr President!</em> was largely regarded as a gimmick. Now it seems downright prescient. Despite the game’s wacky physics and short runtime, its developer, who goes by the handle Game Developer X, says it was always meant as a cautionary tale – not just a cheap meme.</p><p>"When I originally created <em>Mr.President!</em> before the 2016 election, it was built around the logical conclusions of this megalomaniac figure who has openly expressed deep xenophobic rhetoric, admiration for dictators, blatant sexist history, and just a non-stop compulsive liar,” Game Developer X told Aftermath. “People can write it off as a dumbass physics game propped up and broadcasted by YouTubers, but that is the vehicle I chose to get my message across. … In many ways this game was built as a warning sign or a monument to a dark path our country missed. Eight years later this game is more relevant than the day it was made because of the lack of foresight and compassion this country has lost."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Switch has seen several HD remasters and remakes released on it lately, and if you didn't pick up Luigi's Mansion 2 HD at launch last month, you can get a pretty good discount on it right now. Over at Woot, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fluigis-mansion-2-hd-international-version-region-free-1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmamma-mia-luigis-mansion-2-hd-for-switch-has-already-received-a-big-discount%2F1100-6525114%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can save 25% on the game</a>, as the retailer is offering it for the frightfully good price of $45.</p><p>Woot's listing shows the US box art, but the URL mentions "international version," so it's possible you'd get an imported copy from a different region. However, this wouldn't change the playability of the game, as the Nintendo Switch is a region-free console. The only difference here would be the ESRB rating on the box would be replaced with another region's ratings board logo.</p><p>But back to the game itself. Originally released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD stars Mario's taller brother as he finds himself in another haunted neighborhood. Fortunately, the plumber is equipped with some ghostbusting gear and can hoover up the pesky phantoms haunting Evershade Valley. This remaster updates the game for the Switch, and while the old-school tank controls do take some getting used to, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD is full of charm and humor that gives it a quirky personality.</p><p>"Luigi's Mansion 2 HD isn't as essential as some other recent Switch remasters, but it's a charming look at how the ghostly adventure series found its footing," Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review-weegee-board/1900-6418246/" data-ref-id="1900-6418246">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fvideo-game-summer-sale&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmamma-mia-luigis-mansion-2-hd-for-switch-has-already-received-a-big-discount%2F1100-6525114%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Woot is also holding a big sale</a> on video games and accessories, so if you're looking to save some more cash, there's a great selection of things to check out right now on that site.

                <p>Okay, this might sound like a small thing. Maybe it is. But for those of us who have played <em>a lot </em>of The Sims 4, I think this is going to be a big deal: After 10 years of having to go through and apply accessories and makeup to each one of your Sims looks, Maxis is adding an option to quickly apply your selections across outfits. Please join me in a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>Previously, all accessories and makeup looks were bound to a single outfit. This meant you would have to click each and every one of your sim's eight outfits and reapply your watches, rings, necklaces, bracelets, nail polish, eyeliner, blush, and more in order to create any sort of continuity. Now, however, you will be able to simply click a box that allows you to apply an accessory or makeup look to all outfits. You will also be able to uncheck the boxes of whatever outfits you don't want to have that particular look, just in case you don't want to your sim to go running with a full beat.</p><p>This is just one of the free quality-of-life changes coming to the popular life-simulation game alongside the Lovestruck expansion on July 25. Other changes include making eyelashes their own separate makeup category and, perhaps most importantly, the addition of Relationship Boundaries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4334973-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-1screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4334973" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4334973-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-1screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4334973"></a><figcaption>A messy confrontation in The Sims 4 Lovestruck.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4334973-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-1screenshot.png"></figure><p>While Relationship Boundaries are an important part of the upcoming Lovestruck expansion pack, the feature will be available to all players and will greatly impact sim automations. According to Maxis, "The new system allows players to determine the physical and emotional boundaries of their Sims’ romantic interactions--meaning Sims can choose romantic interactions with multiple Sims without negatively impacting their individual relationships."</p><p>To put things a bit more plainly, Relationship Boundaries establish what behaviors your sims will tolerate in a relationship and what actions will make them jealous. For example, you will now be able to create a sim who is unfazed by their partner engaging in WooHoo with other sims, but does not appreciate them flirting with someone in front of them. Though your sim can still be in a relationship with a sim who does not have the same boundaries as them--and can even have discussions in an attempt to renegotiate those boundaries--a sim repeatedly crossing the boundaries of their partner will automatically trigger a dramatic breakup. However, those looking to stay out of the drama can turn off the Relationship Boundaries feature in the game's settings.</p><p>The Sims 4's next expansion, Lovestruck, adds even more fun features to the game. This includes two new personality traits, Turn Ons and Turn Offs, a new town, death by broken heart, a new WooHoo location, an adult board game, sexy costumes, and the infamous vibrating heart bed--iykyk. The Sims 4 Lovestruck launches on July 25 and will cost $40.</p>
