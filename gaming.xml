There is no word yet on whether the streaming version of <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> will come with any extra content, like behind-the-scenes videos, cast interviews, or a Director’s Cut that can make better sense of this confusingly bad film. On the bright side for this movie, there are a few examples of films gaining new life in streaming. </p><p>DC Films’&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em> was a box office smash, grossing over $749 million worldwide, but was maligned by critics for its inconsistent plot, Batman’s pervy kiss on Harley Quinn, and some of the most confusing powers.

<p>In a statement, CEO Mark Lyons said it had been "an extremely difficult decision" but "reflect[ed] the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing".</p>
<p>Lyons' words stopped short of confirming how many staff had been impacted by the most recent round of cuts, or how it will affect its development pipeline.</p>

<p>"Today we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members," the statement began.</p>

<p>"To those of you leaving the studio due to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can."</p>
<p>The statement closed on asking players and fans for their "support and understanding" at this time.</p>
<p>These are the second round of layoffs this year alone. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-true-colors-studio-deck-nine-lays-off-20-of-staff">Deck Nine also laid off around 20 percent of its workforce back in February</a>. A couple of months later, an investigation into Deck Nine showed that although its games celebrated diversity and inclusivity, its own culture allegedly fostered toxicity, hate speech, harassment, crunch, bullying, and abusive leadership as a result of inaction from senior management.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis.

She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination.

        <p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>The game takes place in the near future, where warped monsters and ghouls have appeared from nowhere, swarming cities and forcing humans to battle against these creatures they’ve termed “demons” in an all-out Demon War. After 30 merciless years of war, the surviving humans have banded together under the Missa Association, a religious group formed by a leader who knows the secret to fighting the demons. Cities and civilizations continue to thrive despite the now regular sightings of bizarre monsters.</p><p>Three years ago, a man known as Shin was rescued from among the rubble in a cryopreserved state. With no recollection of his past, he quickly becomes one of the association’s best warriors and protectors.</p><p>However, when Shin comes across the brilliantly beautiful demon named Lux, she feels strangely familiar. This sensation of deja vu leads him to take her in, even if it means going against the creeds of the association.</p><p>From that very instant, the past begins to slowly unfold, revealing the events that caused the city to take on its current form…</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>In this exploration-heavy 2D action game, you will use your demon blade to interfere with the past, create new platforms, and shield yourself from danger to explore a desolate world.</p><p>Other than the Lumina Sword, you will also have access to other weapons such as swift daggers and long-range guns. Find the perfect weapons to suit your fighting style.</p><p>Upon leveling up, you will receive points that can be spent on unlocking skills that will aid you on your journey.</p><p>The whole game is depicted in Team Ladybug’s critically acclaimed gorgeously animated pixel art, in which each and every frame is painstakingly detailed. Feast your eyes on the harsh yet beautiful dystopian cyberpunk world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Blade Chimera - Release Date Trailer (English)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3C8-lx4ACM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Blade Chimera - Release Date Trailer (Japanese)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlmDY7kTdzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Blade Chimera - Release Date Trailer (Simplified Chinese)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ls1mDXvlmIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a two-player game played on two devices. Although it is a <a title="Genres > Co-Op [217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>, what you see on the screens of both players is completely different.</p><p>For example, although they should be looking at the same person, to one it looks like a storybook animal character, while to the other it looks like a robot. (The difference in perception causes the objects on the field to work differently in each world.) Players share what only they can see with their partner through conversation. They continue their journey by cooperating to solve riddles and puzzles. Players can also play online while talking to each other at a distance.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The basic game system is a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> puzzle adventure with a two-player cooperative element. During the course of the story, players are faced with a number of critical choices. Depending on the choices made, the story will unfold in several different ways.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Two boys who ran away from home discover a “dead deer” on their journey.</p><p>Seeing it, they faint and everything they see in each other’s eyes becomes different.</p><p>One is the world of animals, the other is the world of machines. The boys must unravel the mystery that happened to them.</p><p>Can they return to their original world?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>The main difference between this game and other games is that you need a partner to play with.</li><li>You cannot play this game alone or against the computer (CPU).</li><li>Two players are always required.</li><li>In other words, this game starts by deciding “Who will you play with?” The game starts with the decision of “who to play with.”</li><li>The total playing time is about three to four hours. During that time, the two players discuss with each other and reconcile their perceptions, solve problems, and make critical decisions</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;BOKURA&quot; PS5/PS4 Release Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/853b-HiuusU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『違う冬のぼくら』PS5/PS4 リリース告知トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh29qagYthU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《不同的冬天》PS5/PS4 版本发布公告" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn9u55DULcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I hope you’ve all been making good progress on your Advent calendars, whether it’s a simple chocolately one – perhaps grabbed on clearance now that we’re over a quarter of the way through it – a bougie savoury farm shop one, or one that’s filled with treats for your cat or dog.</p>
<p>Christmas has come early (or is coming early) for Xbox gamers and Indiana Jones fans, with MachineGames doing a great job in retranslating the whole archeological action adventure as a first person game instead of a third person adventure.</p>
<p>But first, let’s check in on the news.</p>

The game design and gradually UI change in reflection of your <a title="Genres > Action [2,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s.</p><p>The steampunk-style artwork and the character animations were all handled by a single animator.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>“Nice to meet you… again?”</em></p><p>An android named “Eve” speaks to “you,” before a headless corpse apparently known as “The Professor.”</p><p>Completely devoid of any sort of memory, “you,”　together with “Eve”—an android, and the Professor’s apparent killer—must uncover the truth of what really happened here.</p><p>Use your powers of deduction to unravel the mystery of this sealed laboratory, one revelation after another.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this all-new type of mystery – the kind that’s only possible with video games.</p><p><strong>Characters Depicted in Beautiful Hand-Drawn Animation</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Main Character</strong> – Has no idea who they are due to total amnesia. Somewhat unreliable.</li><li><strong>Eve</strong> – An android. As the main character regains consciousness, Eve is standing before the corpse of “the Professor”. The heroine, and also the prime suspect.</li><li><strong>The Professor</strong> – Eve’s creator. Found as a headless corpse upon the main character’s awakening.</li><li><strong>Kel</strong> – An integrated discipline interface. Something like an AI that punishes people for their <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>es, but which for some reason speaks like a little girl and can be quite agitating.</li></ul><p><strong>User Interface and Game Design that Change Along with Game Progress</strong></p><p>The user interface and game design in general change in accordance with your game progress.</p><p>The story and UI come together, and the general game design gradually transforms, providing an all-new, almost magic trick-like game experience.</p><p><strong>Main Staff and Comments</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scenario: Van Madoy</strong> (known for <em>Revoir</em> series, “Murder at Kogetsukan” in <em><a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/Grand Order</em>) – At the beginning of the project, I thought, “Is there even anything left for me to do in the world of mystery games that my predecessors haven’t already done themselves?” However, as development progressed, I reconsidered and thought, “Maybe I can realize the ideal mystery via the medium of video games.” The concept of this game is “a mystery that can be solved over and over again.” I hope you enjoy the experience of solving the kind of mystery that is only possible with video games—one that’s sort of different from other “multi-ending” games.</li><li><strong>Direction / Development: EIKI’</strong> (known for <em>GENSOU Skydrift</em>, <em>Living in the Ending World</em>) – I consider the adventure genre to actually be a no-rules, cross-species battle. We bring you an all-new breakthrough adventure worthy of its striking visuals and writing.</li><li><strong>Character Design / Animation: Yutaro</strong> (known for <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm7905073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Touhou Tegaki</em></a>, <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm27209687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Touhou Youyoumu: The Maximum Moving About</em></a>) – What’s the point of using hand-drawn animation to express characters in games, especially in adventure-style stand-up fashion? Well, I’d like to give any answer other than “This is the only way I can!,” so let’s say it’s that I’m striving to depict my art in a way that shows the pleasure and rawness of animation in an adventurelayout.</li><li><strong>Sound: RD-Sounds (Diao Ye Zong)</strong> (known for “Sacrament (Vatican Miracle Examiner ED),” “Absolute One-way Street ~Unreachable Message~ (<em>Touhou Project</em> Arrangement Track)”) – A story is, after all, a combination of pictures, sounds, and stories. Game scenes, controls, background music, sound effects, story, visuals… I want to find out just what I can do using sound to fuse all of these elements together in order to tell a “story” in a game.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Short Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="EDEN.schemata(); Short Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsBvUUvyRV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="EDEN.schemata(); （エデン・スキマータ）Short PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7J5t311GPkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest <i>Kill Team </i>season has started with pace, first with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" rel="nofollow">Hivestorm</a> launch box, then the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set</a>, and now with its first expansion, <em>Kill Team</em> Brutal and Cunning. Brutal and Cunning keeps how expansions worked in the last <em>Kill Team</em> season, with 2 brand new kill teams to play, and a Killzone Upgrade to add into games. In this article, we'll look at what <em>Kill Team</em> Brutal and Cunning contains, what you need to use it, and look in detail at the new kill teams.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>What Does Kill Team Brutal and Cunning Contain?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Brutal and Cunning contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Brutal and Cunning Dossier</li>
	<li>8x Ork Wrecka Krew&nbsp;miniatures (and transfer sheet)</li>
	<li>11x Astra Millitarum Ratling&nbsp;miniatures</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Killzone Upgrade: Compound Siege (14 scenery pieces)</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-2.jpg?itok=2gzlSn9V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-2.jpg?itok=6ktZhAQr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Do I Need To Use The Kill Team Brutal and Cunning Box?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Brutal and Cunning is an expansion pack for <em>Kill Team</em> and while it does contain a lot of content, it's not playable out of the box. If this is your first <em>Kill Team</em> purchase, you will need to pick up another couple of items too. The essential items for playing <em>Kill Team</em> are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em> Core Rulebook</li>
	<li>6-sided dice and a measuring tool</li>
	<li>Scenery&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Starter Set</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Hivestorm</a> are the best places to start, and you can add Brutal and Cunning straight onto those boxes to play with.</p>

<h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Brutal and Cunning, as standard with <em>Kill Team</em> expansions, includes 2 brand new kill teams, the&nbsp;Ork Wrecka Crew kill team and the Astra Millitarum Ratling kill team.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-3.jpg?itok=KGoyoyZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-3.jpg?itok=IUYKnyWB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Ork Wrecka Crew</h4>

<p>Orks love a good scrap, but some find appreciation for more than just fighting, like smashing things up as well, and these like-minded Orks band together, albeit somewhat competitively, under a Boss Nob who knows how to focus them. Wrecka Crews are made up of 2 types of Orks (plus the explosive Bomb Squigs), Tankbustas and Breaka Boyz. The Tankbustas come armed with a choice of Rokkit Launchas or 'Eavy Rokkit Launchas (the only difference is the 'Eavy is slightly more accurate, but has the Heavy keyword). Breaka Boys bring along their Smash Hammers which, along with hitting your enemies with, can also make holes in scenery.</p>

<p>The Wrecka Boys like to build up Wrecka Points, which they get by rolling 6's (and some individual operatives have their own ways to gain points). They can then spend 3 points to retain a fail as a success in later rolls. The Boyz also gain bonus APL if they shoot or fight during their turn, giving them some extra mobility to reposition or complete mission objectives after getting in a scrap.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-4.jpg?itok=o3FPHpU- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-4.jpg?itok=HfkRs5nD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Astra Millitarum Ratling</h4>

<p>The Ratlings are tiny ab-humans (Hobbits of the Warhammer 40K universe), which makes them pretty squishy compared to most of the monstrosities you can face in <em>Kill Team</em>, but it allows them to be super sneaky, and great snipers as a result (and they can take the huge Ogryns in their kill team too, but you'll need to pick them up separately from the Brutal and Cunning set). The basic Ratling operative is a Sniper, who if they remain stationary, has 4 attacks with 2+ to hit, doing an extra 3 damage on each 6 they roll. They also have support operatives like the Spotter, Stashmaster, and Battle Mutt to allow the Snipers to keep shooting. My favorite Ratling is the Big Shot, not only is the miniature incredible, but the Tankstopper rifle punches through armor and flesh alike.</p>

<p>Because you really don't want to get your Ratlings into close combat with an enemy, they have the Scarper special rule, which, after your opponent finishes an activation with an operative, allows you to take a free dash action with a Ratling to get them out of harm's way. Each Ratling can only do this once per turn, and you can't do it after subsequent opposing turns (you need a turn in between each use), but it really helps to keep your operatives safe, or reposition so that you can get a shot in your activation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-5.jpg?itok=JiSmAnm7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-5.jpg?itok=3IUF1CM4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kill Team</em> Killzone Volkus (originally from <em>Kill Team </em>Hivestorm) is now avialable seperately, and the Killzone Upgrade in Brutal and Cunning plugs straight into it.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is The Killzone Upgrade In Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p>A Killzone: Upgrade is an add-on to an existing Killzone. In Brutal and Cunning's case, it's Killzone Upgrade: Compound Siege, an upgrade to Killzone Volkus found in <em>Kill Team</em> Hivestorm (and also now available separately). This new scenery and mission pack adds a fortified base to your games and includes the rules for Player vs Player games, and also solo and cooperatively play vs an AI-controlled opponent, both game types involve players attacking or defending the compound.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p>I absolutely love both Brutal and Cunning kill teams. The Wrecka Crew are a lot of fun and surprisingly tactical (you have to be aggressive, but not too aggressive) and while the Ratling miniatures are awesome, they can be a challenge to pilot, as positioning and your activation order is incredibly important. They are not very forgiving (nor will your opponent be) if you get it wrong. It's a great first expansion for this edition of <em>Kill Team</em>, with 2 wildly different styles of play and some incredible miniatures.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Kill Team Brutal and Cunning?</h2>

<p>If you want either of the kill teams in Brutal and Cunning, this will be the only place to get them before their separate release later on. If you don't want either, the Killzone Upgrade is still decent, and playing Ratlings in the compound against a horde of attacking enemies is a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals was released yesterday, and it wasted no time skyrocketing up the charts with reckless abandon. On Steam, the game managed to secure a whopping peak player count of 444,000 users, marking the game as one of the most successful free-to-play titles on the platform right off the rip.</p>



<p>That performance continued throughout the day, and going into the weekend, player numbers, streaming figures, and the social sentiment around the game continued to grow heading into the weekend.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivalling-blizzard">Marvel Rivalling Blizzard</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is perhaps the most potent Overwatch competitor to ever surface – considering Deadlock isn’t here yet, anyway.</p>



<p>In this superhero-themed title, players are treated to the classic hero shooter elements found in and arguably popularised by Overwatch, but the entire roster is made up of instantly recognisable Marvel heroes. From Iron Man to The Punisher and from Groot to Storm, there’s a veritable plethora of performers for players to assume control of.</p>



<p>I <strong>hate </strong>hero shooters, but I’m pleased to say that, being a Marvel fan, Rivals has me hooked.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky year for live-service shooters, what with the loss of Concord and the impending shutdown of XDefiant, so it’s enriching to see a similar title emerge with such gusto into the gaming space.</p>



<p>The reviews <strong>could be better</strong>, but most of the negative press seems centred around Marvel Rivals not doing enough to distance itself from Overwatch, but that’s kind of the point of the game. It’s an alternative option and a competitor – it’d be tough to replace Overwatch if it wasn’t a lick like the game.</p>



<p>NetEase, the developer behind Marvel Rivals, has already revealed some innovative features that are going to help the game stand out. For instance, just days ago, the team stressed that season-based battle passes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-mechanic-change-monetisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be time-bound</a>, so you’ll be able to unlock missed rewards long after the season has ended.</p>

<p>Myth returned to Twitch recently, with audiences welcoming him back after a lengthy hiatus. It was his first stream on the platform since June 2022, and it saw the popular content creator play Fortnite as OG was ushered back into the game.</p>



<p>His return to the site wasn’t the most successful resurfacing ever, with Myth netting a peak viewer count of just 19,500, prompting many to suggest he’s forever his profile on the platform. He did take the time to reveal why he was away for so long, though – and it’s because he was securing a bag from YouTube, of course.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-bucks">Big Bucks</h2>



<p>Myth confirmed mid-stream that YouTube paid him $4 million for two years of work on the platform. That’s alongside all the paid subscriptions and donations he’d have earned while streaming on the site. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, xQc signed a $100 million deal to stream on Kick.com.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1865174067965497616
</p></figure>







<p>Since 2022, Myth has been exclusive to YouTube, on which he currently boasts a whopping 4.5 million subscribers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many will say that Myth has ‘fallen off’ over the last year. In August, he announced he would be taking a lengthy break from streaming, and it was only yesterday that he resurfaced. In this game, you can become irrelevant <strong>very </strong>quickly, and plenty claim that the pause in producing content left a mark.</p>



<p>Back in February, the streamer was broadcasting to little more than 100 viewers, prompting fans to surmise what could be wrong behind the scenes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/otvandfriendsrumors/comments/1ah5i3r/seeing_myth_stream_to_193_viewers_yesterday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">platforms like Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League 2025 season is finally here. Last night, the first round of matches kicked off, but in typically COD League fashion, the evening was marred by technical issues and shattered expectations. Only one match out of four went as predicted, with some huge upsets being dealt very early on.</p>



<p>This opening night could have set the tone for the tournament ahead, but it’s just bizarre to make a statement like that at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-upset">Big Upset</h2>



<p>The season’s opening match saw the all-new Guerrillas M8 take on Minnesota Rokkr, which also boasted a refreshed roster. It went down to the wire, but Rokkr unexpectedly secured the finish in the eleventh round of the final game of Search.</p>



<p>Thanks to Guerrillas M8’s new roster, bolstered by three world champions, the predictions were in favour of the squad. It was far too close a match for those expectations to be delivered on, though.</p>



<p>That trend continued throughout the evening.</p>



<p>Boston Breach dominated OpTic Texas, the COD League’s reigning champion. That marks four years in a row that OpTic has lost its opening fixture in a new CDL season.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Toronto Ultra decimated Atlanta FaZe, the forever favourite. The only match that went as expected was Vegas Falcons vs. Carolina Royal Ravens. That was a 1 – 3 scoreline in favour of the Ravens, which everyone saw coming a mile off.</p>



<p>Before the evening could commence, the CDL 2025 season had to undergo a few technical issues, which is typical for the League. The first match was 20 minutes late starting, and when it was halfway through the first round of Search, the lobby froze, kicking everyone out.</p>



<p>There are plenty more matches yet to land this weekend, but we could be seeing something of a paradigm shift unfolding this year.</p>

The first half of the book focuses on the original and present king of handheld gaming, Nintendo. It kicks off with Game &amp; Watch before moving into the largest section of the book: the Game Boy family of systems. Nintendo DS, 3DS, and Switch follow, and there's even a small section about the Micro vs. System and Pokemon Mini.</p><p>After Nintendo, the book examines the PlayStation Portable, PS Vita, Sega Game Gear, and Neo Geo Pocket Color. Multiple other modern systems are covered besides Switch, including the Analogue Pocket, Evercade, Playdate, and Steam Deck.</p><p>A Handheld History also includes some of the more obscure handhelds and devices from big brands that were overshadowed and ultimately thwarted by Nintendo's handhelds, including Nokia's N-Gage, the Tiger R-Zone, Mega Duck, Atari Lynx, Gamate, and more.</p><p>If you're interested in reading A Handheld History for the Game Boy sections, we'd also recommend two other books specifically about Game Boy. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Boy-Encyclopedia-Released-Nintendo/dp/139909677X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History of the Game Boy by Florent Gorges</a> offers the most comprehensive look at the creation of the Game Boy and the decade of dominance that followed. It's based on hundreds of hours of interviews with key players with first-hand knowledge of the Game Boy's development. This book was recently translated to English for the first time, more than a decade after its original release in French and Spanish, and is part four of Gorges must-read (unofficial) History of Nintendo series. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Boy-Encyclopedia-Released-Nintendo/dp/139909677X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History of the Game Boy is available on Amazon for $28</a>.</p><p>To supplement The History of the Game Boy, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Boy-Encyclopedia-Released-Nintendo/dp/139909677X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Boy Encyclopedia by Chris Scullion</a>.

			<p>This year has been a horrible one for people in the games industry, as there has been nonstop layoffs across the board. From big companies to indie developers, it doesn't seem like anyone has been spared from it. It's been announced that Deck Nine, the developers behind recently released title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> has laid off more staff. This isn't even the first time this year for Deck Nine, as they experienced layoffs earlier in the year, too.</p>
<p>A statement was shared on the<a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Deck Nine X page</a>, where a statement was made by Mark Lyons, the CEO of the company. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members. This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion, and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.<br>
To those of you leaving the studio to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can.<br>
To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time."</p>
<p>At the moment, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been stated, but it is possible that it's due to the fact that Life is Strange: Double Exposure didn't perform to their expectations, as a lot of people were disappointed with the narrative and especially the ending of the game.</p>
<p>The gaming industry has seen more than 14,600 confirmed jobs lost across 175+ companies in 2024. The most recent layoffs that we saw confirmed were layoffs at Ubisoft that happened earlier in the week, where nearly 300 people have been confirmed to be laid off at the company due to studios within Ubisoft being shut down due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/"> XDefiant officially closing down next year</a>. They are also due to experience more layoffs in February, most likely related to the closure of the studios.</p>
<p>It's not been clarified how many people have been laid off at Deck Nine Games, with their number of staff already being relatively small. In February, they laid off roughly 20% of their staff. Combining that with this new layoff, it's hard to know how many staff members will be left at the company.</p>
