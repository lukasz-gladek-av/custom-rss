            <p>
It's been no secret that Remedy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> landed like a piece of haddock at the fishmongers. This shouldn't necessarily be a complete surprise, after all this is their first attempt at a live service game that's all them (they also helped to make CrossfireX, and that didn't go very well either). Still, to Remedy's credit they've also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-still-backing-fbc-firebreak-despite-a-slow-steam-launch-confirming-its-next-major-update-for-september">committed to bring changes to the game</a>, and those changes are coming in the form of a big update titled Breakpoint next week.
</p>
<p>
Moving swiftly along from the fact that this update's name feels like a make or break point for FBC: Firebreak, Breakpoint is set to arrive next week on September 29th. There is some new stuff that's coming with this update, but the main point of it is multiple system overhauls and quality-of-life improvements. I mean, Remedy literally said one of its goals with this update is to "Improve everything about the FBC: Firebreak experience." That's a tall order!
</p>
<p>
One of the big issues with the game is that onboarding just… didn't really work. Many found it a bit difficult to parse, with systems not getting enough explanations. Now, right at the start of the game there's an "Orientation" tutorial level that comes with a voiceover and tips to get you acquainted with the basics. You'll find some new job overview videos to better understand the game's different Crises too.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the Crises, these work a bit differently now too. There's now a Crisis Board, replacing the game's job selection screen, which refreshes every 30 minutes, and you can choose specific Crises to play too. Remedy explains that each Crisis is "currently a curated version of one of the existing five (six with the update) Jobs with randomized rewards, objectives, and length." There's also a new Crisis to play through, based around that mold you might remember from Control. Nasty stuff, but more to do is always good.
</p><p>
The game's economy and progression has been changed too, namely that you keep any gear, guns, or perks you've unlocked. On top of that there are three currencies to be found, and any currency you currently have will be split evenly between these three.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what's next, Remedy says the next major update is coming in late November, which they're currently calling "Rogue Protocol." That one will have cross-platform voice chat, as well as a new game mode. After that, the next big update won't be until March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Who knows whether this update will breathe enough life back into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> or not, but at least Remedy is giving it a good go. You can read about all of the changes and additions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s first-party <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> can’t be beaten when it comes to its breadth of features and comfort. But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The <strong>EasySMX S10</strong>, as it’s called, is available for $50.39 from <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control">EasySMX</a> with code <strong>GETS10</strong>.</p><p>The S10 is comfortable to use for long gaming sessions, and it has features that aren’t commonly built into third-party gamepads, including amiibo support and rumble that feels like it’s in the same ballpark as Nintendo’s HD rumble. It can also remotely wake the Nintendo Switch 2, not just the original Switch, from standby.</p><p>The S10 would be easier to recommend than Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller even if they were the same price, since EasySMX’s model features accurate, power-efficient TMR joysticks, plus some satisfyingly clicky buttons and triggers (note: these are divisive, you might not like them as much as I do). But at $40 less, you don’t need to feel bad about getting this instead of Nintendo’s official gamepad. Take that leftover money and treat yourself to something nice instead.</p><p>If you’re an Android user looking for an unobtrusive Bluetooth tracker for your wallet, Ugreen just launched the <strong>FineTrack Slim Smart G</strong>. It’s just 1.7mm thick (approximately the thickness of two credit cards), letting it to sit next to your other cards without sticking out, and its built-in battery can last for up to five years. For its launch, Ugreen has knocked $2 off the $25.99 tracker, dropping it to $23.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-FineTrack-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0FBWBDB1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The downside is that it can’t be charged, so you’ll need to dispose of it and buy a new tracker once those five years are up. That stinks, but its specs mean it should provide a pretty good five years of service. It features a built-in 80db alarm to help you find it via Google’s Find Hub network, after all, along with IP68 protection against dust and water. Just keep in mind that, if it’s submerged, you won’t be able to track it.</p><p>Now through October 5th, OnePlus has a few back-to-college deals up its sleeve that everyone can enjoy, whether you’re a student or not. The one that caught my eye is the 43mm <strong>OnePlus Watch 3</strong>, which is available for $269.99 ($30 off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDK2QHGH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fbuy-oneplus-watch-3-43mm" rel="sponsored">OnePlus</a> (with coupon code <strong>HARVEST</strong>). The Wear OS 5-equipped smartwatch has gone on sale before, but after a nearly month-long period when it wasn’t discounted, it’s returned to its second-best price to date.</p><p>If you’re shopping for an Android watch, we recommend including OnePlus’ latest wearable on your shortlist. Outside of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715171/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review-smartwatch-wearos-antioxidant-gemini">recent Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, the OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the newest models available. It offers a better value than its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, with updated software, a rotating crown, an enhanced GPS antenna, and a suite of new health features.</p><div><p id="other-deals-we-loved-from-this-week"><h2>Other deals we loved from this week</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Nintendo’s tappable <strong>amiibos</strong> are an expensive hobby, as most figures for the Switch and Switch 2 usually cost between $15 and $40 each. However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30583%26ranSiteID%3Dy9ozrjBcgg8-njoLbLY2R42D6nlyOmcg0Q" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> recently did collectors and trinket enjoyers a favor by slashing prices on a handful of models, which start at just $5.99 a pop. Not just that, some of the newer ones that debuted alongside the Switch 2 (including ones from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>) are down to $15.99 at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30584" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amiibo&amp;rh=p_n_deal_type%3A23566065011&amp;dc&amp;crid=220URFJ8W3DBG&amp;qid=1758548483&amp;rnid=23566063011&amp;sprefix=amiibo%2Caps%2C124&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_n_deal_type_1&amp;ds=v1%3A%2Bg%2BMR7wxIGaD3Vs3%2FhljWFmfTc%2BhMQqdAdiXGyIg5Mc&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> — over half off their original price.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>We highlighted the Prime-exclusive deal on <strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong> last weekend, but it’s worth sharing again in case you missed it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But Village ran so well, the team got to porting.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the most recent Nintendo Direct, Nintendo fans were blessed with the news that not one, not two, but three modern Resident Evil games would be coming to Nintendo Switch 2: Village, Requiem, and Biohazard. But according to Requiem's developers, this wasn't always the plan. In fact, the team didn't originally plan to bring anything to the Switch 2 at all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show, producer Masato Kumazawa explains the story of how the Nintendo Switch 2 ended up with the three most modern Resident Evil games on their way to the system:</p><blockquote>The Switch 2 hadn't been announced when we started planning this game [Requiem], so of course it wasn't in the original plan. When the Switch 2 was announced we were able to start testing developing games for it, and we thought it would be great if we could bring the Resident Evil series to this platform. We started off with internally porting Resident Evil: Village to see if it would work well on the hardware, and it looked really great, so that gave us the confidence to add a Switch 2 version of Reqiuem to the plans, and that led us to the recent announcement where we confirmed not only Reqiuem was coming, but 7 and 8 would also be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Kumazawa is gassing up the Switch 2 port of his own game, but I played a brief section of Resident Evil: Requiem at Tokyo Game Show in handheld mode on the platform and...yeah, it looks pretty good! I asked him as a follow-up if there was anything unique about the Switch 2 version of the game, and his response that no, there isn't, "in a good way." It's just Requiem, on the Switch 2, able to be taken on the go. And though my sampling of this experience was brief, I'm optimistic from that short demo that Kumazawa's not just all talk here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

And to eager Resident Evil fans, me, and many of my coworkers, it seemed obvious that we were finally going to get a new trailer revealing Leon's official precense in the game, as a playable character or otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not what happened. We did see a new trailer, but no Leon. And a preview build available at TGS, which I went hands-on with after my interview, was similarly bereft of Leon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I brought up the strangeness of my expectations and the resulting Leon Kennedy drought to Nakanishi and Kumazawa, they just laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will take on board this feedback," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Fan clamor for Leon has been going on for months now,</a> ever since the game's first trailer appeared to contain multiple teases for, at minimum, a Leon appearance. But rumors have since grown, with some suggesting Leon might show up in the game as a secondary playable protagonist alongside newcomer Grace Ashcroft. Nakanishi and Kumazawa have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">attempted to brush those rumors aside</a>, saying that Kennedy is a poor match for Reqiuem's less action-heavy tone, but the fervor has persisted anyway, and the two are stopping short of saying outright that we won't get to control him at all, even for just a little bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all this discussion, I asked the pair if they had any concerns that all the Leon nonsense was distracting from their attempt to position Grace as the game's star. But they're not worried. "We're always happy that people are interested in the game enough to speculate so much," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, then, the pair are so insistent that Grace is the new face of this Resident Evil story, could Reqiuem server as a sort of passing-of-the-torch between old and new Resident Evil? Not quite, Kumazawa says.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although we don't have firm plans for the future storylines of later titles in the series, I still think passing the torch is probably going a bit too far, because we're not just going to wipe the slate clean completely in terms of the series lore and history. But at the same time I don't want to always have to just go back to the well of existing characters to create new games, which was part of the motivation to introduce Grace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

            <p>
Heart Machine have had a busy year. It was only in January that they launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> into early access, a surprise follow-up to their beloved indie action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. That launch didn't go amazingly due to a myriad of reasons, and even now the game hasn't completely managed to find its footing yet. And then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a>, their search action (not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">Metroidvania</a>) game that at long last has a release date!
</p>
<p>
That date is quite soon, too: November 11th, less than two months away. This date came with a new little gameplay overview trailer, showing off some of the tools the game's protagonist will be able to use on her journey. I'm quite into the concept behind them, they're all just things you're likely to find left behind in a ruined city; a computer mouse, an electric guitar, a pair of sunglasses, all usable in combat that's apparently partially inspired by games like Smash Bros.
</p>

<p>
The overall concept is a tantalising one too. You play as Luca, a teenage girl caught up in the mess of a quarantined city whose body becomes so damaged she's forced to let a demon named Rhem in to fix it. This city is in ruins because of some experiments conducted by an evil corporation (the evil being a bit moot there because when isn't a corporation evil), with other demons having possessed everyday household objects.
</p><p>
Possessor(s) marks a bit of a departure for Heart Machine having transitioned to a 2D, sidescrolling plane. There's certainly the hallmarks of the studio with its fresh concept and killer art direction, I'm just hoping they've managed to pull off a hit given how Hyper Light Breaker has been put through the ringer. We'll find out in a couple of months!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sales of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> did not initially seem good. In&nbsp;Square Enix’s May 2024 financial report, company president Takashi Kiryu stated that PS5 sales of <i>the game “</i>fell below expectations”, making players worried about the third and final chapter of the game.</p>
<p>Worry no longer as director Naoki Hamaguchi has spoken and said that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will be of the same standard. Speaking to Automaton he said “The second entry, FFVII Rebirth, has been doing very well on both PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/01/30-upcoming-pc-games-for-2025/">PC</a>. I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we’ll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third instalment.”</p>


<p>“Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely,” he adds. “A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything.”</p>
<p>“For new players discovering Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Nintendo Switch 2 or Xbox Series X|S, I’d love for you to first enjoy that experience, and then also play the second game when it launches, while anticipating the third instalment,” he concludes.VII</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 has yet to get an official title and does not have a release date, but if it has the same sort of development length as the first two chapters, it should be out in 2027.</p>

<p>We scored the second title a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">winning 9/10</a> in our review.&nbsp; “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love,” said Nic. “It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-strangest-game-of-the-year-is-a-channel-surfing-simulator.1310454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not quite October yet, and there are still plenty of video games set to be released before the end of the year. Even still, I’m pretty convinced that <em>Blippo Plus</em> will go down as the strangest release of 2025.</p><p>Calling it a game might be a bit of a misnomer; it’s more of an alien television simulator. The idea is that, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear, you’re able to tune into a TV network from another world, the titular Blippo Plus. You don’t really “play” the game, but rather flip around the channels — there are FMV shows with human actors, covering everything from dramas to cooking — to better understand the alien culture. (It’s also a full-color follow-up to one of the weirder additions to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review">the Playdate’s second season</a>.)</p><p>Over time, you might notice some connections between the seemingly disparate channels, with a strange phenomenon that also connects you, the viewer, to the story. There isn’t much interaction besides changing the channel, but at various points, you’ll have to adjust the picture so you can actually see things clearly, as well as check your messages to download “data packets” that update the channels and further the story. In the first packet, for instance, the aliens become aware they’re being watched and adjust the programming accordingly. That includes launching a new channel aimed at explaining their culture, from food to fashion to language.</p><p>It’s all very strange, and it’s made even stranger by the low-budget, retrofuturistic tone. Most of the channels are pretty weird, like a psychic weather network or a channel focused on sensual computer gear. There’s a teen chat show called <em>Boredome</em> and even a channel that’s just “video cola,” which is exactly what it sounds like: close-up shots of bubbling soda. These aren’t full-length TV shows; each lasts just a few minutes, but they’re played on a loop so that you can catch everything. I don’t want to say too much more here because the fun really comes from discovering things. But I will say that there’s something satisfyingly nostalgic about flipping through channels — a practice that has largely been killed by streaming.</p><p>The most remarkable thing about <em>Blippo Plus</em> is that, as oddball as it is, it does eventually start to make some sense. At first, it seems completely random, from the unappetizing alien meals to the low-budget <em>Star Trek</em> costume and makeup design. But once you start paying closer attention, the connections become a lot clearer, and it’s pretty satisfying to piece things together and watch a much larger story unfold. If only it came with a remote control.</p><p><sub>Blippo Plus <em>is available now on the Switch and Steam.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/785848/blippo-plus-review-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/27/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Your choices for ethical gaming are getting slimmer by the day as it looks like EA is the next big video game firm to be swallowed up by the gigantic Silver Lake Management, which is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Also taking a stake will be Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, you may recognise that name as he is Trump’s son-in-law.</p>
<p>News of the takeover surfaced Friday afternoon, causing EA shares to surge 15%, valuing the company at around &nbsp;$48 billion. Nothing has been finalised as of yet but the deal could be announced as early as next week and would be one of the biggest industry takeovers of the year.</p>


<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund already owns 10% of Electronic Arts and&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">all of Niantic</a>., It also has stakes in Riot Games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Activision Blizzard</a>, Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Take Two,</a> Capcom, Embracer, Nexon, and <span data-complete="true">Koei Tecmo. The fund has earmarked $38 billion to be invested in video game companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Electronic Arts had a poor start to the year as sales of their annual football game were lower than expected, but things have bounced back with “better-than-expected contributions” across its portfolio. The general consensus from previews is that their next game, Battlefield 6, is going to be very good and should sell well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer Invercity Game Works has unveiled a new survival action game titled Project Retrograde: The Becoming with a trailer published on IGN's YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The game looks heavily inspired by CAPCOM's survival horror franchise Resident Evil. Perhaps a little too much, in fact. Anyway, it's being developed for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and there's no public release window yet. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nixinggame.com/en/invercity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> offers a basic overview of what players will find in Project Retrograde: The Becoming:</p>



<p><em>In 1995, humanity's last hope—Project Retrograde—collapsed as the underground world was shattered by the ancient parasite L.U.C.A. Play as a bounty hunter symbiotic with parasite, using its dangerous power to save the world, even if it consumes you.</em></p>



<p><em>Infected by L.U.C.A, you survive and gain the ability to absorb combat memories from other hosts. Unlock parasitic skills, become a Kung Fu master or the Baba Yaga, and experience adrenaline-fueled combat!</em></p>



<p><em>Delve into the post-apocalyptic realm filled with retro technology. Manipulate the LUX system to alter underground weather, or climb towers to reach unknown regions and uncover the truth buried for years.</em></p>

            <p>A group of financial investors are in "advanced talks" with EA to go private with a valuation worth around $50 billion (£37.5 billion).</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">Wall Street Journal (£)</a>, the investors – thought to include equity firm Silver Lake, Affinity Partners, and Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF) – could announce a deal as soon as next week. If true, this would make it the biggest leveraged buyout ever.</p>
<p>News of the potential deal sent EA's share prices rocketing, closing 15 percent higher on Friday.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's PIF <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">increased its stake in FIFA publisher EA</a> back in 2023. The PIF initiative was designed to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p><p>Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, Embracer, Nexon, Capcom, and Ubisoft, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">boss Yves Guillemot secured PIF funding</a>, leading to new DLC for 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">set in 9th century AlUla, an ancient Arabian city</a>.</p>

It's the weekend once again, but before we dive into what we're playing, let's just do a quick recap of the last week.</p>
<p>First up, it seems only right that we go over some of the reviews we posted this week, because these include some pretty big games:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><br>

<p>Onto the news, and the bigg'un this week is the confirmation that Nintendo of America's President, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">will be retiring at the end of the year</a>. Devon Pritchard will be taking over the role, while Satoru Shibata will join NoA as its CEO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> was announced for the Switch 2 and will include a brand new tale, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> confirmed an awesome <strong>Mega Man</strong> collaboration for its upcoming DLC.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which was originally due to launch in early October, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">has been delayed to an unspecified date</a>. Not hugely surprising, and to be honest, there's so much coming out in the coming weeks, we'll be happy to wait for this one.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This week I finally finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, by which I mean I rolled credits after almost 30 hours with a 74% completion rate. I've since gone back, collected some more masks and grubs, and killed a couple of optional bosses bringing me up to 81%. I should really step away now - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades 2</a> isn't going to play itself, and I've run out of things to spend Geo on. BUT! Beating the final trial in the Colosseum of Fools will get me another Pale Ore (I think?), and then I can upgrade my nail one more time, which would be neat. Can I resist seeing that percentage counter go up to 100 112?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I did start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which feels very Ubisoft, but not bad - I'm looking forward to playing more. However, payday arrived and I immediately ticked off one of my wishlist; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a> is now on my Switch 2. Despite lacking official S2 compatibility, I'm going to try it there and switch back to my OLED if I hit problems. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> this weekend and see if that resolution update has actually made a substantial difference. It really is a remarkable game, but man, does it look rough on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is also on the cards, and I'd also like to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst: Deluxe</a> if I can find the time. Oh, and I've also picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> on the PS5, so that'll be a pretty high priority for me.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I think I’m closing in on the first end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> and that’s good news. Not that I want it to end, I should stress, but my backlog from September alone is already looking at me with a hard stare, and I don’t want to picture what it’ll look like after <em>all the games</em> come out in October.</p>
<p>Between Silksong sessions, I’ve been plugging away at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> (also very, very good), and I recently picked up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> which, I hate to admit, I’ve never actually played. Oh yes, and I have Hades 2 locked and loaded for when I find a minute in-between all that.</p>
<p>So, a nice quiet one then!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Home stretch on Shinobi: Art of Vengeance with every level beckoning an endurance battle of skill, patience and some degree of sheer luck... a regular day for a ninja then. Being a complete sucker for mechs and SRPGS, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> and so far its a blast. It certainly was a long wait but Hades 2 is finally out of early access and a timed exclusive on Switch hardware. I’m a bit rusty but Melinoë certainly stands tall to Zagreus. I was not disciplined enough to have waited till November to pick up the physical edition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 19 of 50 games played. Golfaria is quite something!</p>
<p>Game of the week is (still) Star Wars Outlaws. With Kijimi complete, time to head for Akiva on the prowl for a droidsmith. I’m leaving Tatooine for last, looking forward to that.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm sticking with Hades 2 for the foreseeable future, mostly because I want to see <em>everything</em> this game has for me post-credits, but I also want to start afresh and run through the game proper. What a game. Supergiant is far too good to us.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm still fighting the urge to start a fresh save in Silksong. Thankfully we're away this weekend, so I don't think I'll be caving into my vices yet. Enjoy the weekend! Spooky season approaches!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As this is my first trip to Japan, I really had no idea what to expect. With a cultural knowledge based on anime and Yakuza games, that’s probably made me ill-equipped for the safe, respectful and utterly down-to-earth culture I’ve found in Chiba. Nobody has run up to me on the street demanding a brawl, nobody has screamed about an incoming Kaiju, and it’s almost like the real world is not like video games and TV shows. Except that Tokyo Game Show isn’t normal.</p>
<p>I interviewed a man in a rubber mask today. While I’ve been here, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/27/let-it-die-inferno-preview-uncle-death-returns-to-smash-up-the-roguelike/">Let It Die: Inferno</a> has been the focus of lots of my time – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/tokyo-game-show-2025-day-one-report-there-are-a-lot-of-games-here-and-one-of-them-electrocuted-me/">see yesterday’s electrocution</a> – and Gungho and Supertrick Games conducted the interviews for it with one of the development team embodying the iconic Uncle Death from the series. This didn’t so much derail my brain as it sent it charging down a side track into a disused station, but it was surprisingly informative, even if I wondered whether I was about to embark on my own journey into hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today was the day I didn’t get lost. Yesterday I tried to make sense of the Tokyo Game Show’s layout, and I came out utterly lacking. If you enter the show floor, you become trapped in the seventh circle of video games, unable to leave, but unable to move, and I started to see the same landmarks – the Nioh 3 demon, the Wizardry cosplay, the Inazuma Eleven stand – over and over again. Perhaps it was the copious amounts of free Red Bull, but I was utterly stuck yesterday.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Friday showed that I still have the ability to learn, and I was able to make sense, and make headway with the show floor. In fact, I probably got a bit too carried away, whizzing through neon booth after neon booth, and then couldn’t escape as they seem to have a wonderful habit of closing half the exits. Still, I have made it out, but I have now developed a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, longing once more for my captor.</p>


		
		

<p>Day two was more about discovery, and I bumbled across a bunch of games, starting with the impressive lineup in the Devolver Digital section. They’d created a setup like a traditional Japanese street with lanterns and wooden shutters – overall, I have to say that the stands here took what I’ve seen at EGX and Gamescom to a new level – and nestled amongst them I got to play Ball X Pit and Skate Story, both of which left me thoroughly impressed.</p>
<p>I then happened upon Tiny Metal 2, a sequel to a game that tried to fill the void caused by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo basically giving up on Advance Wars – let’s forget that in the meantime they vaguely remembered about it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars 1+2</a>. Tiny Metal 2, though, is what should happen to this genre, and it’s ramped up the grid-based tactics with a modern makeover and… well, that seems to be about it, but who needs anything more than that?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TINY METAL 2 Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y7bFiHvjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once again, TGS has proved the best place for catching up with folks in the industry, and I happened on a friend at the Polish games stand who’d led our cultural exchange mission to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/how-katowice-in-poland-is-aiming-to-become-a-global-gaming-industry-giant/">Digital Dragons in Krakow earlier this year</a>. TGS isn’t just about Japanese development – far from it – and it’s attracted exhibitors from across the globe. It would be interesting to know just how well imports perform in Japan, since this is a nation at the foundation of the modern game development scene, but the exhibitors I talked to all agreed how positive, dedicated and enthusiastic the crowds were.</p>
<p>Based on the number of free bags I saw, the star of TGS 2025 has been Ananta. This upcoming free-to-play game certainly looks cool, but it’s also hard to argue with a giant, neon green rucksack, emblazoned with an anime rabbit girl. It was so big, I saw plenty of punters struggling to know what to do with it, and I swear I caught people in the act of trying to get in there themselves. Oversized bag aside, Ananta is one to keep your eye on, especially as it’s covering all bases with mobile, PC and PlayStation releases.</p>
<p>The importance of mobile to the Japanese gaming scene has surprised me, and there were a host of mobile-only titles with big, main hall stands that have clearly got the budget and the backing to make a serious dent in other people’s wallets. It feels far more like a legitimate part of the gaming landscape here than it does in Europe, and it’s well worth remembering that gaming doesn’t start and stop with consoles and PC, especially when our phones can pump out things like Infinity Nikki and Zenless Zone Zero without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The end of yesterday produced one further surprise in the shape of the canned goods bar. This is a bar where you grab a tiny shopping basket – like one you’d give to a three-year-old to play shopkeeper with – fill it with canned goods, and they’re then dispensed cold to you as a bar snack while you drink a craft beer. This was weird enough, but the fact that Spam sat happily amongst the bespoke produce as a culinary delight was the point I decided it was probably time for bed.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Game Show has proved to be an incredible celebration of the Japanese and international game development scene. The end of this year, and then on into 2026, looks like it will bring a cavalcade of great releases, and, as ever, Japan remains at the centre of that. I can only hope that I get to cover TGS again in the future, as I’ve never found a safer, more welcoming and more engaged show in all the years I’ve been writing about games. If you get the opportunity to go, make sure you take it!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you call your game Let It Die, you’re sending a clear message to your players. The thing is, the first Let It Die game – released all the way back in 2016 – probably did want you to die, because its free-to-play business model meant that if you died, you could pay real-world money to revive yourself.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, that didn’t really catch on in a wider sense – imagine if Elden Ring charged you each time you died? – but it caught on enough that Let It Die is now entering its 32nd season and remains one of the most unique FTP titles we’ve ever seen. It’s little surprise then to herald the arrival of its direct sequel, Let It Die: Inferno, but this is now a roguelike that’s taking everything good about the original and turning it into a full-price premium game. A Let It Die game without the microtransactions? That’s definitely worth talking about.</p>
<p><iframe title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Roguelikes weren’t really all that popular back in 2016, so in some ways, the first Let It Die was seriously ahead of its time. Given that pretty much everything is a roguelike now, it feels as though Let It Die: Inferno is coming out at the perfect time, ready to hoover up all the more recent fans of the genre. Producer Shin Hideyuki told us, “Absolutely, this was the best time for it. In the original game, it had the concept where if you die, it’s over. And that concept in this game is even more pronounced. Death is still something that’s kind of taken lightly because the more you die, the stronger you will become, but it will still be an over-the-top, overwhelming death.”</p>
<p>We didn’t get to see all that much narrative framing through our hands-on, but given that the original was largely centred on you being at the whim of the idiosyncratic Uncle Death, that’s probably all the motivation you need. Uncle Death himself – or at least a member of the team who was wearing the rubber mask – told us, “He’s going to be making appearances in the game in that aspect. So, the electricity you experienced yesterday [they strapped me to a machine that electrocuted me when I took damage] was all him, and anything you see in the Let It Die world is probably his idea. In many ways, this is the game made for Uncle Death and, sort of, by Uncle Death if you will.”</p>


<p>That’s all getting a bit meta, but what is clear is that the team at Supertrick Games are thoroughly set on embodying and imagining the game that its iconic frontman would make. Given that they spun off from the original Grasshopper Manufacture devs, and that the follow-up Deathverse: Let It Die took the franchise into a creative cul-de-sac, it’s not all that surprising that they want to be true to the original ethos of Let It Die. Through our hands on, that seems to have been achieved with plenty of success.</p>
<p>While you still begin the game with a spot of character selection, Let It Die: Inferno sees those choices become more curated, and the ‘Body of the Day’ basically has you choosing between different builds with different starting stats. Through our demo, Timothy has balanced stats and healing skills, while Pearl specializes in offense, and has skills that can break through enemy defenses with ease. In action, Pearl certainly had the upper hand in our playthrough, so much so that I accidentally make it all the way to the boss without levelling her up, but one of the team members reassured me that death at any point is a good thing.</p>
<p>This being a roguelike, death is the point of the game. As you die, you can turn some of the accumulated experience or currency into permanent upgrades, meaning that the next time out, things are going to be easier, and you’re going to make it just a little bit further. They’ve also retained a flavour of Deathverse: Let It Die with a Battle Royale-like system that sees you fighting against a clock, trying to make as much progress and then escape before the area becomes utterly toxic to your character.</p>
<p>The team told us, “This time you have escape pods that are inside the levels, and they’re placed randomly through every run. You have a time limit in which you have to reach these escape pods to get out of the level. You might just completely luck out and get an escape pod right near you. So that is just good luck, but there are times where you will absolutely not find one, and in those times it is definitely going to be very challenging.”</p>

<p>The roguelike framing for Let It Die: Inferno feels like it’s stronger than ever, and that fight, that rush to collect experience within the time span, just works incredibly well. I really wanted to push the boundaries, and after my death to the first boss, all I wanted to do was jump back in with another run. That bodes very well.</p>
<p>After the last game’s short-lived success, it was clear that the team didn’t want to repeat the same mistakes, but there were still important lessons to be learned from it. They told us, “In Deathverse, the previous title, we couldn’t have PvE – it was more PvP – so that’s something we wanted to include. In Let It Die: Inferno, we’ve managed to put in the PvE aspect while retaining the PvP aspect from Deathverse that players liked.”</p>
<p>That sense of legacy, and that sense of continuation, runs very clearly through Let It Die: Inferno. The combat, the inventory management, and the overarching setup remain absolutely recognisable, but this is the 2025 reimagining of that original vision. The visuals are fantastic – as you’d expect with a jump in generations and the shift to Unreal Engine 5 – and there’s a newfound vibrancy and energy to the game which wasn’t there before. That unique weirdness, that Grasshopper Manufacture flavour, is still here, but it’s been refined and reinvigorated for the modern day.</p>

<p>The key improvement is the game’s shift in business model. From all of the people I’ve spoken to about Let It Die, it’s clear that the number one turn-off was its free-to-play setup. It was clearly an inviting and hardcore roguelike action game – not quite a soulslike, but certainly a challenging hack and slash – and its gameplay loop was perfectly paced to draw you in. It was when it started asking you for money as you died that many players switched off. Hopefully, players will remember just how much fun the combat was and buy into the idea of Let It Die: Inferno as a full-priced title. On early impressions alone, it’s well worth the asking price.<br>
<em><br>
Let It Die: Inferno is due for release on PlayStation 5 and PC on December 3rd, 2025. </em></p>

<p>There's a lot of new game footage on display at Tokyo Game Show this week, and on top of all the Square Enix game trailers, the company has now shared another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>.</p>
<p>This game was announced earlier this month and will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>Now, at Japan's big gaming event, Square Enix has premiered roughly 17 minutes of live gameplay footage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@squareenix/streams">during its stage event</a>. The gameplay is featured between 27:43 - 44:39 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-17-minutes-of-tgs-2025-gameplay">thanks, Gematsu</a>), and while it's all in Japanese, there's still enough footage on display to get an idea of what you can expect.</p>

<p>If you didn't catch the news earlier this month, Square Enix has also confirmed there's no upgrade path available or planned for the Switch version. So you'll need to buy the title on Switch 2 if you want to play it on this system. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> (due out next month) also got a trailer yesterday showing off the new underwater region.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Square Enix has also shared roughly 18 minutes of gameplay footage of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> during the same stage event. This title is arriving for Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December 2025. You can see the gameplay on display between the 40:00 - 58:10 mark in the video below:</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Sega this week surprised Yakuza fans with the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It will be making its way to Nintendo's new hybrid system early next year on 12th February 2026, and while we've already got a teaser of what to expect, the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has now shared a "first look" at the combat gameplay in Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>
<p>In case you missed the announcement, this "evolved edition" is based on Kazuma Kiryu's original PlayStation 3 title, which was released in 2009. And Dark Ties is a brand-new tale starring Yoshitaka Mine (Kiryu's adversary). This package promises to bring not only intense battles but also added cutscenes and reimagines the original outing with cutting-edge visuals.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:188290 @ 1758991074 -->
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will launch for Switch 2 on 12th February 2026 and will be available as a digital and physical release, with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirming it's a game-key card release. Before this, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> are coming to the Switch 2 this November. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-announced-for-switch-2-launching-in-february-2026">previously confirmed</a>, these games are also getting game-key card releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> didn't get off to the best start when it arrived on the Switch 2 in June, but IO Interactive has made an effort since then to improve the overall experience.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the developer has now released <em>another</em> game update, which makes some updates across all platforms and also resolves multiple bugs in the Switch 2 version of the game. This follows an update in August, which added a Frame Rate option to lock the game at 30fps.</p>
<p>The latest update has also been made available alongside the new elusive target mission, featuring Bruce Lee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bruce Lee enters HITMAN World of Assassination as the next Celebrity Elusive target, but this time with a twist. Together with 47, Agent Lee takes his legendary martial arts skills undercover to infiltrate the Concord Union and take them down from the inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187051 @ 1758992170 -->
<p>Here are the patch notes for this latest update, bumping the title up to Version 3.240 (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-3-240-update-out-now-patch-notes-includes-nintendo-switch-2-fixes/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>

</nav>
<h2 id="hitman-world-of-assassination-version-3-240">Hitman World of Assassination - Version 3.240</h2>
<h3 id="new-features"><strong>New Features</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Two-Handed Tweaks</strong><br>
Aiming of two-handed weapons has been improved; it is now based on the position of both hands. Previously, it was based on the main hand, adjusted slightly with the support hand.</p>
<p>Collision of weapons when wielded with both hands has also been improved; it is now based around the barrel of the weapon. This should help to prevent drifting when holding a sniper above railings.</p>
<p><strong>Bullet in the Chamber</strong><br>
Last patch, we added tactical reloading, where reloading a non-empty magazine didn’t require you to rack the slide. We have since iterated upon this and the chambered bullet is now visible when racking the slide.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpened Scope</strong><br>
We’ve made some improvements to cases where far away objects could become invisible when looking through a sniper scope, causing great difficulty when sniping from certain vantage points.</p>
<p><strong>Savor the Moment</strong><br>
Various key moments and kill opportunities are now in third person, allowing you to take pride in your work.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive Interactions</strong><br>
We have made various improvements to touch interactions, including adding hand poses when your hand comes into proximity with them.</p>
<p><strong>Screw the Big Screen</strong><br>
We’ve moved some starting and exit cutscenes into 3D instead of using the 2D “cinema mode” screen.</p>
<p><strong>Pistol Placement</strong><br>
When starting a mission, concealed weapons (e.g. pistols) are no longer stored in a hip holster. Instead, they are placed in the inventory wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Firm Grip</strong><br>
We’ve improved the alignment of various items when they’re held.</p>
<p><strong>Holster Feedback</strong><br>
We’ve changed how the feedback works for holsters.</p>
<p><strong>Options Bonanza</strong><br>
We’ve added various options allowing you to refine your experience so that it’s just right.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Aiming</strong>
<ul>
<li>Controls how weapons are aimed when wielding them with both hands. The default is the new positional aiming mode, but this can be changed to the previous behavior.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Firearm Angle</strong>
<ul>
<li>Last patch, we added an option allowing you to change the angle of a held firearm. We’ve now split this into two options for one-handed and two-handed weapons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Grip</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabling this allows you to release the grip button while keeping items in your hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All platforms</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultimate Warrior</strong><br>
We’ve added the ability for you to holster two items on your back. Currently, this is restricted to Katanas and the new Kali Sticks from The Bruce Lee Pack, but we are evaluating more items that may benefit from this feature.</p>
<p><strong>Safehouse Shuffle</strong><br>
We’ve added a new gear wall in the Safehouse basement. It is currently used to house items from “The Banker Pack” and “The Bruce Lee Pack” DLCs.</p>
<p><strong>Spooky Safehouse</strong><br>
With Halloween on the horizon, we’ve added some themed cosmetics to the Safehouse. These are available to use now so you can ensure your bones are sufficiently rattled for the big day.</p>
<p><strong>Undercover Antics</strong><br>
We’ve enabled the following disguised entrances in “The Banker” and “The Monarchique”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undercover in the Kitchen (Palace Staff)</li>
<li>Undercover in the Locker Room (Chef)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Store Remodel</strong><br>
The in-game store page has been divided into separate categories to give a clearer overview of what each DLC grants.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
<p><em>As always, many of the fixes below were resolved thanks to reports made by the community. We extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who continues to report issues they run into – stay vigilant!</em></p>
<p><strong>Level Design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breaking and Entering</strong><br>
Resolved an exploit in the Safehouse where the bedroom could be accessed via the bathroom before the required mastery level was reached.</p>
<p><strong>Folded Out of Life</strong><br>
Resolved various situations in The Banker where Le Chiffre could suspend his routine.</p>
<p><strong>Follow No More</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where the steps could get stuck on “Follow the Guard”.</p>
<p><strong>Fruitless Escape</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Banker where Le Chiffre slipping on a banana peel could trigger the helicopter escape cutscene and cause mission failure.</p>
<p><strong>Leaving a Message, Are We?</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Banker where Le Chiffre would talk with General Murillo on the phone, even if he was otherwise indisposed.</p>
<p><strong>No More Stalling</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in The Banker where using some interactions while poisoned stopped 47 from being properly relocated when the timer ran out.</p>
<p><strong>Sore Loser</strong><br>
Le Chiffre will now flee when on high alert or when the VIP Room chandelier is broken. This resolves an issue where the poker game could “continue” despite the broken chandelier rendering the table unusable.</p>
<p><strong>The House Always Wins</strong><br>
Resolved an exploit in The Banker that let players distract the cashier while being handed chips, causing them to be duplicated indefinitely. The casino’s ledgers are balanced again.</p>
<p><strong>Tricky Trespassing</strong><br>
Fixed inconsistent trespassing zones the lounge found in The Banker where the zone extended past the intended barrier posts. We’ve also fixed staff disguises being regarded as hostile in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>Counter-Intuitive</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in Sapienza where breaking the glass on the display case and walking on a bag of potatoes in the butcher shop allowed Agent 47 to walk on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>No More Vanishing Acts</strong><br>
Resolved a small spot in Sapienza where objects could fall through the floor when thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Wall of Nothing</strong><br>
Eliminated an invisible obstacle in Sapienza. Even the legendary Agent 47 can’t blend into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>When Hitmen Fly</strong><br>
Corrected an issue in Sapienza that caused 47 to fall when climbing through a specific window in the Town Hall, above Bravuomo’s office.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Map</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where the camera could go out-of-world near the tunnel to the Coca Fields in Santa Fortuna.</p>
<p><strong>Boxed In</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in Mumbai where subduing the guard leaning on a wooden crate in the Construction Site caused Agent 47 to clip into it.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Drop</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in Whittleton Creek where dumping a body over the railing in the garden of certain houses gave two conflicting prompts that could lead to incorrect animations.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Disposal</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in Haven Island where Agent 47 could get stuck when dumping a body into the water near the villa’s main entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Laser Reactivation</strong><br>
Fixed a bug in Berlin where taking items from the briefcase caused the laser tripwires placed on the Radio Tower to turn back on after being disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Unseen, but Not Unbreakable</strong><br>
Removed some invisible collision in Chongqing found in The Block</p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unbuttered Blades</strong><br>
Fixed a bug that left a knife lodged in a toaster in an apartment in Sapienza. 47 prefers his tools sharp, not toasted.</p>
<p><strong>Knock, Knock</strong><br>
Corrected the issue in Santa Fortuna where using gate knocker at Rico’s compound while an NPC opens the door causes it to start floating.</p>
<p><strong>No More Surprise Cactus</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in Whittleton Creek where a cactus would suddenly appear inside another plant in Helen’s room.</p>
<p><strong>Telepathic Construction</strong><br>
Resolved an issue in Chongqing where the crane near The Block was not properly aligned with the ground.</p>
<p><strong>CHARACTER ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fool’s Gold</strong><br>
Fixed the waistcoat of The Devil’s Own so it is the proper golden color instead of white.</p>
<p><strong>A Perfect Fit</strong><br>
Corrected the visual issue with Murillo’s security guard disguise, where the loose jacket created the illusion of a bulkier Agent 47.</p>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case Closed</strong><br>
Fixed an issue where the prompt for a silent attack displayed as “Eliminate” when Agent 47 carried had the camera and a briefcase equipped, even though the action only pacified NPCs.</p>
<p><strong>Handle with Care</strong><br>
Resolved an issue where a crash could occur when picking up a remote-triggered item.</p>
<p><strong>My Precious</strong><br>
Resolved a bug preventing the “Golden Wrench” from being placed on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Sharp End Forward</strong><br>
Fixed an issue where “The Cat’s Claw” melee weapon would stick into NPCs with the hilt when thrown, instead of the blade.</p>
<p><strong>Cleanup Crew</strong><br>
Corrected a bug that prevented Suspects from being “cleaned up” with shredders or incinerators.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Reaction</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in alerted Syndicate Takedowns and Showdowns, where the Targets/Suspects didn’t enforce Agent 47 until he changed disguise or started trespassing.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe Adjusted</strong><br>
We’ve corrected poison crafting in the Safehouse Shed. Only the “Poisonous (Emetic) Mushroom” may be used now, as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Echo</strong><br>
Resolved a bug where Le Chiffre’s poison effect carried over into other missions, slowing dialogue until the game was relaunched.</p>
<p><strong>Out of Place</strong><br>
Corrected a bug in Dubai where taking down an NPC from cover behind a locker in the changing room caused Agent 47 to clip into a linen basket.</p>
<p><strong>UI</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Certain Something</strong><br>
Corrected the English description of the Purple Fiber Wire the phrase now properly reads “<em>Je ne sais quoi”</em> instead of the incorrect “Che nes cet quoi”.</p>
<p><strong>Lost in Translation</strong><br>
Corrected previously missing or incorrect translations; they are now properly translated and transcribed.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Briefing</strong><br>
Fixed an issue in The Final Test where overlapping text could appear after loading a save with a mission story being tracked.</p>
<p><strong>Details Restored</strong><br>
Resolved a bug in the planning menu where showing details of agency pickups unlocked by default displayed no image in the popup.</p>
<p><strong>Elusive, but Not <em>That</em> Elusive</strong><br>
Corrected an issue where Year One Elusive Targets failed to display in the Career tab.</p>
<p><strong>Learning the Hard Way</strong><br>
Addressed a bug where choosing the “How to Play” video in the Freelancer menu could cause the game to crash.</p>
<p><strong>Typographical Errors</strong><br>
Fixed various typos found in the subtitles for dialogue in The Banker.</p>
<p><strong>PLATFORM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deal in Silence</strong><br>
Resolved an issue on PS5 and Switch 2 where some sounds were inaudible, most notably in Freelancer when gaining or losing Merces (e.g. when buying from Suppliers).</p>
<p><strong>Trust Your Instincts (Once Again)</strong><br>
Corrected an issue on PS4 and PS5 where, under certain circumstances, Targets and Suspects failed to appear in instinct.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Grace</strong><br>
We’ve (hopefully) fixed the infamous “PS5 saving bug” where the saving icon can appear and then refuse to disappear indefinitely. Thanks for your patience, Agents.</p>
<p><strong>Clearer View</strong><br>
Corrected an issue on PC where the “Adaptive SuperSampling Techniques” option was not visible in the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Clone Mix-Up</strong><br>
Corrected an issue on Epic Games where The Splitter Pack DLC appeared under the wrong name and without an image in the installed content list.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing is Caring</strong><br>
Resolved a bug on Steam preventing The Banker Pack DLC from supporting refunds or family share.</p>
<p><strong>Vacation Restored</strong><br>
Corrected an issue preventing Sapienza missions from being accessed offline on Epic Games.</p>
<p><strong>Confusion Controls</strong><br>
Fixed an issue on iOS where the analog stick could show when using certain set-pieces that didn’t require it.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Marksman</strong><br>
Fixed an issue on iOS where it was not possible to activate the marksman trait when using touch controls</p>
<p><strong>Limber Up</strong><br>
Improved performance and frame drops across all iOS devices by implementing shader prewarming.</p>
<p><strong>No More Sudden Exits</strong><br>
Resolved a bug on certain iOS devices (iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad Mini 7th Gen) where adjusting the “Adaptive SuperSampling Technique” option mid-mission could cause the app to unexpectedly close or crash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-awaited Mega Evolution era has finally arrived in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> following the Japanese releases of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Brave and Mega Symphonia</a> in August 2025. With their towering HP values, spectacular full-art designs, and that notorious 3-Prize rule when a Mega ex is knocked out, these cards are already shaking up both the collector market and early deck-building experiments in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-has-so-much-pokmon-stuff-its-almost-unfair">Japan</a>, and we expect the same to happen worldwide, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like every major set, certain chase cards have risen to the top. That’s whether for playability, stunning artwork, or simply the popularity of their featured trainer or Pokémon. Below, we’ve ranked ten of the most expensive Mega Evolution cards in today’s market on our favourite dedicated marketplace, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVExJN?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, starting from the lowest on the chart and working up to the crown jewel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Mega Brave and Mega Symphonia expansions have already delivered some of the most eye-catching and valuable cards of the year, with the 10 most valuable of which from the combined Mega Evolution set can be found below, for those who don’t feel like scrolling through the whole larger list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with the set only just being released, TCGPlayer's exact most valuable card rankings are changing rapidly, due to continuous market price changes. So, be sure to also check out the live page showing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVExJN?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most expensive Mega Evolution Pokémon cards on TCGPlayer</a> right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, as for our top 10, from dazzling behemoths like Mega Venusaur ex and Mega Gardevoir ex, to nostalgic Special Art Rares of fan-favourite trainers like Lillie’s Determination, collectors are still scrambling to secure them before prices climb higher. Here’s a quick look at the ten of the most expensive cards currently dominating the Mega Evolution market.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Venusaur ex - 155/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228417"><div id="228417" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 155/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Venusaur ex cards in general thrive on endurance, and Mega Evolution's is no different. Solar Transfer lets you freely move Grass Energy around, while Jungle Dump delivers 240 damage and heals 30, making it tough to topple. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">5ban Graphics’ artwork reinforces that bulk, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMyRZ?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> crouched under vibrant petals in a pose that radiates raw power. Both a sturdy option in Grass decks and a visually commanding card, it’s a sought-after Ultra Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. <strong>Mega Absol ex – 161/132 (Ultra Rare)</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228412"><div id="228412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Absol ex - 161/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Absol has always had a cult following since its debut in Gen III , and this new Mega form captures that same aura of menace. <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3wk0?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Absol Ex's</a> Ultra Rare gives us an eye-catching, almost gothic rendering, making it look like it has stepped out of a noir film, with its mix of black and yellow tones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Competitively, its Terminal Period attack is an intriguing win-condition attack, knocking out foes that line up perfectly on damage counters, while Claw of Darkness offers raw power plus disruption. Though it’s a little clunky in the current fast-paced meta, Absol’s fan appeal ensures this one holds value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Vulpix – 138/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228413"><div id="228413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vulpix - 138/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMD5o?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vulpix</a> won’t shake the meta with Stampede and Combustion, which are serviceable but underpowered. What makes this card stand out is its Illustration Rare art by saino misaki, showing the fox Pokémon curled up by a fireplace in a warmly lit, rustic room. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a cosy-looking slice-of-life card that collectors are eager to chase, proving once again that atmosphere and nostalgia can lift even a low-power card into a high-value slot.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Marshadow – 146/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228414"><div id="228414" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marshadow - 146/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marshadow is one of the more competitively promising Illustration Rares. Shadowy Side Kick deals respectable damage, and its effect of blanking damage to <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PO01?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marshadow</a> on the following turn if it takes a KO can stall opponents effectively. Altogether, this card straddles the line between competitive tech and collector gem.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Bulbasaur – 133/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228416"><div id="228416" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Already a major seller amongst Pokémon TCG collectors on TCG player, this Mega Evolution <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeK1D5?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur’s</a> Bind Down is a deceptively disruptive move, trapping your opponent’s Active Pokémon in place while chipping away at their board state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This utility, combined with Bulbasaur’s nostalgic allure as the original Grass starter, gives it both competitive and casual appeal. Artist mashu delivers bold, swirling colours that make Bulbasaur appear almost dreamlike, enhancing its chase factor. Along with being playable, it’s one of the most visually striking cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Lillie’s Determination – 169/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228415"><div id="228415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 169/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not as dazzling as its more artistic counterpart below, this UR of <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrJNG?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie's Determination</a> is already one of the hottest chase cards of the Pokémon TCG’s Mega Evolution set. Atsushi Furusawa’s stunning full-art design captures Lillie with delicate, vibrant detail, and the card effect remains a flexible draw option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may not dominate the competitive scene, it is almost guaranteed to headline binders and display cases. It can be easy for newcomers to underestimate Lillie’s immense popularity, but that doesn’t stop its position near the very top of the set’s value list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Ivysaur – 134/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228418"><div id="228418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 134/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Razor Leaf offers a reliable 60 damage for two Grass Energy, positioning <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4PYR?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a> as a useful bridge to Mega Venusaur in dedicated Grass decks. The artwork, again by mashu, captures Ivysaur leaping forward with fierce determination against a backdrop of glowing foliage and vibrant petals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the full Kanto starter line, collectors are eager to build the evolutionary trio, and its combination of steady damage and stunning visuals cements its rising market value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mega Venusaur ex – 177/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228421"><div id="228421" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our third-most valuable card in the Pokémon Trading Card Game’s new Mega Evolution set, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgwoD?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> is a true battlefield tank, with Solar Transfer enabling seamless Energy redistribution and Jungle Dump delivering 240 damage while healing itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, this makes it one of the most flexible and durable attackers in the set. The SAR artwork by mashu is extraordinary, depicting a lush, chaotic jungle scene bursting with colour, where Venusaur looms as a dominant presence. The synergy of competitive utility and jaw-dropping art is what has pushed this card into the top tier of value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Lillie’s Determination – 184/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228419"><div id="228419" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 184/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Few Trainers hold the same sway in the secondary market as Lillie. Not only does the floral artwork of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqm4j?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Determination</a> by Atsushi Furusawa give off endless warmth and nostalgia, the actual effect of this Trainer card is great as well: refreshing your hand with six new cards or even eight when behind, presenting real utility in control and comeback strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top, Lillie’s sheer popularity, though seems to be additionally driving the price tag into the around-$200 stratosphere, just as we’ve seen with her earlier Sun &amp; Moon prints.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228420"><div id="228420" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Priced at over $500 at the time of writing, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31qeq?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex</a> stands as the Pokémon TCG's crown jewel of the Mega Evolution set. Whilst Overflowing Wishes accelerates Psychic Energy across your Bench, Mega Symphonia converts that fuel into devastating damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raita Kazama’s museum-quality artwork, full of pastel tones and floral elegance, perfectly matches the card’s grace and strength. It’s this union of competitive power and striking style that cements this beautiful piece of cardboard as the set’s most coveted prize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
