			<p>Code Vein II is so much more than I expected. As much as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">I loved the first game</a>, it was pretty plainly “anime Dark Souls” at a time when soulslike competitors were still relatively few in number. It was successful enough to earn a sequel, and so I naturally expected to find something immediately familiar in Code Vein II. By the end of my time with it, though, I was blown away by how original, engaging, and uncompromised the vision for this game is – and how much I loved playing it.</p>
<p><iframe title="CODE VEIN II - Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8MFT2Jo7CN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In my first couple hours with the game, I thought I had my answer locked in. “Oh my gods,” I thought as an expansive open world and motorcycle were revealed to me, “this is anime Elden Ring!” You’ve got statues you activate to rest, level up, and respawn enemies. When you die, you drop your earned currency and can recover it if you return to that spot before dying again. If this was the height of the game’s ambition, I wouldn’t have been offended at all. Code Vein II is set in a gorgeously haunting post-apocalypse world, full of abandoned cities and toppled towers and cold, lifeless beaches that said so much with so little. It’s a massive map, that slowly expands as you progress through the game, and right out of the starting moments I was in love with simply wandering away from my specified destination to explore and poke at corners and fight hidden enemies.</p>



<p>There’s more to this, though, and while some of it snuck up on me over time, one of the immediately noticeable elements that makes Code Vein II so unique and ambitious is its story. Code Vein II is, when you boil it down, a post-apocalypse vampire time-travel doomsday adventure. It throws all of that at you at once, and some of it doesn’t immediately stick. My quest to travel 100 years into the past with my time-traveling companion Lou – who sacrificed half of her glowing golden heart to revive me, by the way – makes total sense to me. As does the goal to learn some secret from the past to bring back the powers of legendary heroes and then to defeat corrupted versions of them and prevent a doomsday event from triggering in the present. Some of the finer points are muddy, but it’s an interesting muddiness where some things feel a bit underexplained, while others feel purposefully brushed aside to hide the true intentions behind my quest.</p>

<p>It’s honestly fascinating to be tossed into a world like this that has lived, died, and lived again for hundreds of years. The game expects you to know a few things that I definitely had to visit the in-game glossary to understand, but the meat of the narrative experience lies in the untraditional use of time travel – it’s shockingly simple compared to many Japanese time travel games. It acts far more as an emotional ignition, if anything. You spend hours in the world of a century ago, bonding with these heroes and learning so much about them. To return to the present and fight those familiar friends as corrupted bosses genuinely carries weight to it. When you’re then given the choice of going back to save those new friends at the risk of altering or destroying your current timeline, the weight of those choices felt so real.</p>
<p>So, narratively, there’s a lot more going on with Code Vein II than just vague item descriptions and implied lore. Combat and gameplay, similarly, add on a lot of interesting layers here that go beyond what might be familiar. Surprisingly, almost none of the systems or finer mechanics from the original remain in the sequel. Blood Veil armor from the first game is gone entirely, for example, and you now have access to all clothing options within the character customisation, which is easily the most in-depth character creator I’ve seen in a while.</p>

<p>I’ve never played a game that let me pick custom nail designs and colours for my character, curl my characters hair at specific angles and lengths, or let me enable, disable and combine layers and pieces from different outfits together to create my own fit. It’s a thrill, and I might have spent about as much time creating my character as I did playing through the entire first section of the game. I can’t wait to create more characters as soon as I’m done writing this and go deep on a Photo Mode session with all the poses and dances they provide.</p>
<p>But once you’ve finally settled on your look, then the real character building begins.&nbsp; You’ve got a wide variety of gear types to think about in this game, but instead of creating a build with levelling up certain stats and choosing gear to match, it’s your gear combos that dictate your stats, speed and gameplay style.&nbsp;There are primary weapons, special Bequeathed Formae weapons, Formae abilities for your main weapon, defensive Formae shields, Blood Codes, Jails, and Boosters. Blood Codes and Boosters establish your base stats, and the rest of your gear have specific stat requirements – if you overload on certain stats, you’ll trigger negative results like stamina loss or health drain. If you balance it carefully, though, you can also trigger positive effects that can outweigh those debuffs. I usually stayed within the means of my stats and never played with the risk/reward of these stat boons, though.</p>

<p>Weapons range from short and swift to large and heavy to interesting ranged hybrids, like bayonet-equipped rifles and floating energy blades. They can be equipped with up to four unique Formae abilities, and those abilities use up Ichor to activate – as do your Bequeathed Formae weapons and some Formae shields. Primary weapons and the Formae abilities you give them are what dictate your playstyle the most, and I loved experimenting with their properties to find a certain attack loop or Formae ability that really clicked. The Bequeathed Formae, though, never really stood out for me. Early on, they either do very little damage, or have far too much windup and wind-down time, and just aren’t worth the resource-drain or risk. Formae shields are great, though. Some are standard shields for blocking, some can only be used to parry, and one in particular that I fell in love with gives you an invincible spirit-dash that uses up Ichor but is so, so satisfying.</p>
<p>To build that Ichor back up, you’ll use your Jails. Each of these is a very different sort of special attack, but they all do two important things. First, landing a Jail attack will restore some Ichor, and second, the more damage you do with your primary weapon leads to higher damage from a follow-up Jail attack. I actually found the Jails to be the most transformative part of my builds, because being able to reliably build up Ichor can drastically change how you play the game.</p>

<p>For a while, I was running with a build where my Jail was a medium-range scorpion stinger that knocked back fodder enemies. I ran into a massive boss that moved too fast and too far to reliably hit with that Jail, forcing me to swap to an entirely ranged Jail that summons a hoard of golden bats who peck at your foe and periodically feed you Ichor. With that new ranged Ichor resource, my Formae abilities and dodge were constantly available, and I beat the boss on my next try. That loop of experimentation and build-altering happened a lot for me, and it was always satisfying having a reason to try out so many new things.</p>
<p>Another big part of your arsenal are your partners – the NPCs who follow you everywhere. You can pick one at a time to join you, and each one brings a different combat style and different buffs to your own stats. Interestingly, you can also “Assimilate” your partner, absorbing them into your own body so they’re no longer helping you on the field, but lend you additional buffs and stat bonuses as a result.</p>
<p>Code Vein II is getting some flack for removing the co-op feature the original game had, and I thought this partner system might be designed in a way where that lack of multiplayer made sense, but I’m not so sure. The feeling of isolation playing by yourself is engrossing, and it’s fun to have my partner be an NPC I bonded with through the story and not, like, my buddy Alex. But the first game also had that energy to it, and still had co-op support. I get the feeling that technical limitations were at play here more than anything else – this is a big, gorgeous game, but it also struggles with the frame rate on PS5 at times, whether I’m playing on quality or performance mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvel has revealed a new expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/marvel-to-launch-official-ttrpg-marvel-multiverse-next-year" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em></a>. The <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion introduces new rules for the more cosmic parts of the comic book universe, including how to deal with entities of near-infinite power.</p><h2>The <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> Expansion Announcement</h2><p>The announcement of the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion happened via an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1302969366?" rel="nofollow">Amazon store</a> listing. The store listing is sparse, but it does contain some pertinent information.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-secret-wars-god-emperor-doom-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=WQ55TqTv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="500" height="530">

  </picture><p>The new expansion is 256 pages and lists the authors as Matt Forbeck, Alex Irvine, and Marty Forbeck. Both Forbecks have also written the&nbsp;<em> Marvel Multiverse RPG</em> Core Rulebook and the <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Spider-Verse</em> expansions, and all three have worked together on the game's Avengers expansion.</p><p>As the name implies, the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion focuses on the cosmic, interdimensional antics of the Secret Wars comic event. This 2015 comic event saw the collapse of the Marvel multiverse into a single pocket universe called Battleworld, all presided over by God Emperor Doom.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the Marvel comic event that, among other things, introduced fan-favorite Spider-Man Miles Morales into the main Marvel universe.</p><p>This highlights two selling points in the book's store listing. The book will include an adventuring framework for players to fight their way through Battleworld and save the Marvel Multiverse. In addition, it will include rules on how to "handle Rank X characters of unbelievable might." The latter can easily refer to God Emperor Doom as well as other cosmic-level threats like Galactus.</p><p>Notably, the store listing for the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion will contain material for other parts of cosmic Marvel lore. This includes material on the Fantastic Four, the Negative Zone, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and more.</p><p>The book is currently available for pre-order at an MSRP of $49.99 and is set to release on August 18, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Sega have gotten just a little bit too good at making Sonic games. Not good as in 10/10 masterpieces, good as in competent, as in mostly jank free, and where there is jank it's the annoying, not very funny kind. I like it when the blue hedgehog is impossible to control in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a> actually! But look, when I go on to tell you about a game that captures that same unruly spirit of Sega's early 3D games, please ignore that Christmas was a month ago because SantaCorps 4 is a 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> that really does have the messy, gloopy sauce.
</p>
<p>
First order of business: no, to my knowledge there are not three other SantaCorps games you've never heard of, though there is another one called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398700/SantaCorps_Snow_Patrol/">SantaCorps: Snow Patrol</a> that's very much a Bombermanish, arcadey type situation that may also be worth checking out. SantaCorps 4 sees you playing as a member of the titular SantaCorps, all because Kris Kringle himself ain't doing so hot, and it's up to you/them to save Christmas. Standard!

<p>
Essentially what you're trying to do from level to level is rack up a whole bunch of points. To do this, you can dash about the place at ridiculous speeds, zipping through stars to collect points a la Sonic doing a ring dash, climbing down chimneys to deliver presents, lighting up Christmas trees, all while trying to maintain your ridiculously fast pace to keep your combo going. It's maybe even too fast! And you can't control the camera! But it's also just a lighthearted bit of fun, there's nothing pressuring you to do good, just an encouraging hand pushing you towards mach five.
</p><p>
It is also cheap as chips, or at least as much as a bougie coffee, so if you're in the mood for some silly, speedy fun, even if it is seasonally inappropriate, you can pick it up on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398530/SantaCorps_4/">here</a>. Oh, and there's co-op too! What more could you want?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220</link>
            <guid>1416916</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em> is out on PS5, Xbox, and PC</a> and it’s been a weird day for the unique new hero shooter. There were <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184">false claims</a> it had worked with disgraced streamer DrDisrespect and a myriad of technical issues plaguing its first hours on Steam. Now, as the dust settles, <em>Highguard</em> has racked up over 9,000 reviews on Valve’s storefront, but the vast majority are negative.</p> <p>On January 26, after a period of radio silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">following its reveal at the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard</em> launched for free, offering players a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter” experience complete with destructible environments and cool mounts to ride into battle on. However, shortly after the game’s launch, players began reporting problems. One of the first was that many, myself included, couldn’t even play <em>Highguard</em> due to the overwhelmed servers. Far from the worst issue to have on launch day.</p>

 <p>Once players got in, many reported performance issues on PC, with rigs equipped with high-end hardware still struggling to play <em>Highguard</em> at a steady framerate. And after getting through all that, some players have found matches in <em>Highguard</em> boring and slow, complaining that the 3v3 format and large map don’t mix well. Sprinkle in some bad-faith users attacking the game for looking “woke,” whatever the hell that means, and you end up with a horrible Steam review rating.</p> <h2>What is <em>Highguard’s</em> Steam review rating?</h2> <p>As of 5:10 p.m. EST, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash"><em>Highguard</em> has 9,442 user reviews on Steam</a> across all languages. Of those nearly 10,000 reviews, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#:~:text=19.8%25%20positive%20reviews-,7%2C230,-80.2%25%20negative%20reviews">SteamDB data shows 7,230 of them are negative</a>. This adds up to a “Mostly Negative” status on Steam with fewer than 2,000 positive reviews. Ouch. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012011">Over on the PlayStation Store,</a> things are better, with <em>Highguard</em> sitting at nearly 2,000 reviews and a 3.34 out of 5-star rating.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to assume this is some nefarious review bombing, and I do think <em>some</em> of this can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=highguard+woke">blamed on bad actors and annoying chuds</a>. But scrolling through the reviews does show a lot of players just don’t seem to like the slow pace of the game and the 3v3 format.</p>

 <p>“The maps in this game are way too big for 3v3; the size would fit better for 5v5 or 6v6,” posted one Steam reviewer. “In the looting stage, the map is too big and empty considering it’s only 3v3, and the only things in it are red and blue chests (and the crystals i guess),” shared another user. “The 3v3 format on such a huge map just doesn’t click for me, and the overall experience becomes chaotic without bringing anything new to the table,” said someone else.</p> <p>Of course, it should be noted that not even 12 hours have passed since <em>Highguard’s</em> launch. So all of these reviews are based on a dozen or so matches or less. The real question will be what happens in the next few days, weeks, and months–assuming <em>Highguard</em> sticks around that long–and if the devs can turn the ship around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You are not immune to AI psychosis. Much like cult indoctrination, it can happen to anyone given the right circumstances. Take Matthew Gault, games and tech writer at </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>. After failing to convince his friends to play </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> with him, Gault thought it would be funny to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/i-replaced-my-friends-with-ai-because-they-wont-play-tarkov-with-me/"><span>replace his buddies with an AI chatbot</span></a><span>. It ended up not being very funny at all.</span></p> <p><span>Gault is a self-described “certified AI hater,” though he concedes that LLM technology is useful in certain instances (I agree to disagree with Gault’s assertion that offloading transcription to an environmentally catastrophic machine built on stolen labor saves valuable time and energy). Gault’s friends were turned off by the difficulty of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>, an extraction shooter which came out of early access last November. He described playing by himself as lonely. “Then I saw comic artist Zach Weinersmith making fun of a service, Questie.AI, that sells AI avatars that’ll hang out with you while you play video games,” he writes.</span></p>

 <p><span>What started as a joke quickly became more sincere. Gault found he genuinely enjoyed playing </span><i><span>Tarkov</span></i><span> with his Quest.AI companion, Wolf. “It was, I thought, not unlike playing with a friend who has more than 1,000 hours in the game and knows more than you. Wolf bantered, referenced community in-jokes, and it made me laugh.”</span></p> <p><span>Gault was surprised and concerned by his own enjoyment of the chatbot, his previous confusion over how people could fall victim to AI psychosis replaced by understanding. He states he will not continue using Quest.AI: “I never thought anything like [AI psychosis] could happen to me. Now I’m not so sure. I didn’t understand how easy it might be to lose yourself to AI delusion until I’d messed around with Wolf. Even with its shitty auto-tuned sounding voice, Wolf was good enough to hang out with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Gault’s experiment ended with his real friends making fun of him for using Quest.AI by ironically using another LLM, ChatGPT, to send messages to him. Gault’s account is another entry in the emerging genre of seemingly normal people jokingly using AI chatbots and discovering things can get weird very quickly. YouTuber Eddy Burback popularized the phenomenon with his chilling </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRjgNgJms3Q"><span>documentary</span></a><span> “ChatGPT made me delusional,” which has garnered over 4 million views in the past two months. As Silicon Valley continues to shove LLM technology down our collective throats, it feels like only a matter of time until even more strains of AI psychosis—both simulated and sincere—begin to emerge. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Game Devs Call Exploit Allegations ‘Clickbait Exaggeration’ And ‘Malicious Defamation’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/screeps-world-steam-game-exploit-pc-hack-2000663214</link>
            <guid>1416898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The developers behind a popular “open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts” on Steam, named </span><i><span>Screeps: World,</span></i><span> have been forced to update their game “in order to protect both players” and their “own reputation,” following the discovery of an alleged “remote code execution vulnerability” that would enable players to take control of other players’ computers. Even worse, the person who helped discover the vulnerability in question alleges that Valve “ignored” their reported findings.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re noticing an overabundance of quotes in the previous paragraph, there’s a good reason for that, as this story spawned out of a rather nasty back-and-forth </span><a href="https://x.com/IsaacKing314/status/2015195819251736630?s=20"><span>on X</span></a><span> between </span><i><span>Screeps: World’s</span></i><span> developers Screeps, LLC and an “information security” aficionado by the name of Isaac King.</span></p>

 <p><span>As King explained in his initial post, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> apparently allowed “any other player in the game world to gain remote access to your computer” through the use of a programming exploit. For context, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> is a programming game that lets players write their own code in JavaScript, which is then used to craft their own custom-made AI units.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663224">©Screeps, LLC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As of this writing, the game is currently sitting at a “Very Positive” review score on Steam, having amassed roughly 1,876 reviews and, according to </span><a href="https://app.sensortower.com/vgi/game/screeps-world"><span>VG Insights</span></a><span>, over 113,000 individual purchases.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you want the exact explanation of the reputed vulnerability, I highly suggest reading King’s highly detailed write-up of the exploit </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/"><span>on his blog</span></a><span>. I will, however, warn you in advance that it requires (at least) a base understanding of JavaScript to fully understand.</span></p>

 <p><span>Thankfully, King includes an analogy for “non-programmers” in the conclusion: “imagine if there were one particular kind of unit in </span><i><span>Starcraft</span></i><span> that, if you trained it, let people hack your computer. And when pointed out, the game designers said ‘well this is self-inflicted, the players all chose to train that unit’.”</span></p> <p><span>King also explains that the developers have been aware of the issue since July 2024, as one of Screeps, LLC’s two developers replied to a report </span><a href="https://github.com/screeps/screeps/issues/162#issuecomment-2223049479"><span>on GitHub</span></a><span> detailing the vulnerability. The dev in question replied, stating that they “do not see this as a serious security threat.” However, a user from the Screeps Discord </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/usage.png"><span>noted</span></a><span> that the vulnerability had been successfully abused in the past.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once the initial post on X began to gain traction, the official Screeps X account replied stating that the accusation was “at the very least, a clickbait exaggeration, and at worst, malicious defamation intended to cause reputational damage.” Nevertheless, they also stated that the alleged vulnerability has, as of January 25, been removed from </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The potentially more worrying side of this is that King noted in his blog post that he’d reported the issue to Steam directly, but didn’t receive a reply: “I reported the game to Steam, which of course they ignored. Their terms of service make them not liable for any hacks caused by malware on the platform, so if it’s getting sales from which they can take a cut, why do anything about it?”</span></p> <p><span>We’ve reached out to Valve to corroborate this, and will update the piece if they reply.</span></p>

            <p>
It is inevitable that when a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> rocks up, is really good, and makes a gazillion dollars, that there will be the odd imitator here and there. Sincerity, flattery, yada, yada, yada, point is, it's all fine as long as you at least put enough of a twist in there to make it more of an "influenced by" over a "wholesale ripoff" kind of thing. I think Gambonanza, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilding chess game, fits into the former quite nicely.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not going to explain chess to you, you already know how that works. How Gambonanza works is that instead of the usual 8x8 grid, it has a much smaller 5x5 one. When you start a run, you have just three lowly pawns to work with. Your goal is to capture all of the enemy pieces, which are randomised per run, and if a pawn manages to reach the other end of the board it gets a promotion, i.e. you can turn it into a rook, knight, queen or other pieces. But the Balatro of it all are perks you can acquire called Gambits.
</p>
<p>
These are essentially the equivalent of Balatro's Joker cards, modifiers that can aid you in your quest to chess. For example, one Gambit allows you to skip your opponent's turn if you manage to capture an opposing piece with a pawn. Another Gambit earns you a king piece upon earning a promotion, which, as a point, you can also have a team full of kings, if you can get that many - as long as you have no more than three per round.
</p>
<p>
Beating a round earns you money, money lets you buy gambits or more pieces, you can continue to see the Balatro comparison in its meta strategic elements, but ultimately you're still playing Chess. Well, chess where there are boss battles, and pieces that have extraneous effects like tiles disappearing when your opponent captures one of your pieces, so not exactly chess, but you get what I mean.
</p><p>
It's all quite neat and satisfying, there isn't the overwhelming sensation of stress that comes from playing actual chess, the Gambits feel useful, and you can only have five of them so no overpowered runs for you. It's chess Balatro! And there's nothing wrong with that. If you'd like to have a go yourself, then you can head to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509230/Gambonanza/">Steam page</a> to try out its current playtest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and Capcom is letting players know what they can expect if they have Sony’s best PlayStation console.</p>



<p>In a post on the Japanese PlayStation Blog, game director Akishi Nakanishi discussed how Resident Evil Requiem will play on the PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro).</p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-gets-an-optimized-experience">PS5 Pro Gets An Optimized Experience</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2026/01/27/20260127-requiem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nakanishi revealed that</a> PS5 Pro users will be able to turn ray tracing on and off. With ray tracing turned on, players will be able to play Resident Evil Requiem at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second (FPS). </p>



<p>Should you be on a monitor that supports higher frames, you’ll be able to take advantage of rates up to 120 FPS. Nakanishi said that there will be an average of 90 FPS on the system.</p>







<h2>What Is Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the long running horror franchise. The new game follows FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she’s tasked with investigating a number of strange deaths at the Wrenwood Hotel in Racoon City. It’s the same location where her mother, Alyssa Ashcroft, was killed eight years prior. </p>



<p>It also seems the return of Leon Kennedy who has to look into incidents that have been linked to scientist Victor Gideon. The game’s events are set roughly 30 years after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<p>The game releases on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184</link>
            <guid>1416859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Once-ubiquitous online game streamer Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, who was banned from Twitch after <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-sexting-minor-response-1851559888">sending “inappropriate” messages to a minor in 2017</a>, posted a photo of a media badge on January 26 and said he had been invited to a pre-release hands-on event for the newly released, free-to-play raid shooter <em>Highguard</em>. However, multiple people who attended the event denied seeing him there, and some Reddit users believe his photo was faked with gen AI or Photoshop. And <em>Highguard’s</em> creator manager says he wasn’t invited and didn’t attend.</p> <p>On Monday, ahead of the launch of <em>Highguard</em>, DrDisrespect posted an image of a keyboard, a can of energy drink, a personalized controller, and a <em>Highguard</em> media badge with his name on it to his X account. He claimed to have played <em>Highguard</em> at a recent media event in Los Angeles. “Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out #Highguard,” he wrote. “Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Highguard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Highguard</a>.</p> <p>Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension!</p> <p>Yayayaya <a href="https://t.co/kQ56GEfonB">pic.twitter.com/kQ56GEfonB</a></p> <p>— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Immediately, people online began sharing the post and claiming the PR team behind <em>Highguard</em> had made a huge mistake inviting someone like DrDisrespect to the event. The streamer was suddenly banned from <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">Twitch in June 2020</a> and then later lost sponsorships and other business deals after confirming he’d once sent messages that were “inappropriate” but not “illegal” to someone else on the platform who was under the age of 18. He now streams exclusively on Rumble and YouTube, which allowed his channel to be monetized again after <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">a multi-month review of the allegations</a>.</p> <p>“Choosing to work with a self-admitted pedophile to market your game is certainly…A choice,” <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2015836937865634276">posted a game dev and writer.</a>&nbsp; “Never heard of <em>Highguard</em>. Is it good marketing to have the first news about your game that some people hear be that you invited a pedophile to your preview event?”<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3mddtienlps2x/quotes"> posted someone else on BlueSky.</a></p>

 <p>But, not long after the post started going viral online, creators came out to deny that DrDisrespect was ever at the event, claiming he was lying about being invited.</p>   <p>“Dr. Disrespect was not invited to the early access event,” <a href="https://x.com/TheMacroShow/status/2015875906271904060?s=20">posted creator Macro on Twitter</a>. “I know this because I WAS THERE, and I promise you, everyone would’ve noticed that pedo a mile away. There’s so many valid things you can criticize <em>Highguard</em> for, but this isn’t one of them.” Kate Sánchez, the EIC of<em> ButWhyTho</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3mddwfcpcf22h">also denied he was there, adding</a>: “I literally did not see him there – unless creators had a different day.” Another content creator, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blessingjr.bsky.social/post/3mddxvxapqs2q"><em>Kinda Funny</em>‘s Blessing Adeoye Jr</a>., also believed DrDisrespect was not at the LA event, but said there was a second day for creators only. Sánchez and Adeoye Jr. didn’t attend the creator day.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinpua?originalSubdomain=ca"><em>Highguard</em> creator manager Chin Pua</a> replied to a viral tweet about DrDisrespect and <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060">confirmed that he</a> “was not invited to any <em>Highguard</em> event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to <em>Highguard</em> PR but has yet to hear back.&nbsp; A freelancer <em>Kotaku</em> sent to the event didn’t see DrDisrespect at the press day either.</p> <p>Over on the <em>Highguard</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1qnd1vl/is_dr_disrespects_badge_fake/">some players are theorizing that DrDisrespect faked the image</a> using AI tools or Photoshop. The evidence involves how the media badge looks compared to other real, confirmed badges from the event. It does seem like, if he were there, he was given a somewhat unusual badge with a different layout than other attendees. If DrDisrespect didn’t attend, he has yet to publicly confirm that on social media or elsewhere. He also streamed the game on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015815750825730082">Rumble and YouTube</a> on launch day.</p>

<p>The internet’s social corners are ablaze following a recent claim from Dr Disrespect that he was invited to play Highguard alongside Wildlight Entertainment in Los Angeles. The ‘Two Time’ posted an image on social media of an ID card from the recent event and directly stated he’d taken ‘the Lambo to LA’ to play Highguard.</p>



<p>Even though it took literal seconds to figure out Dr Disrespect’s image was a fake, likely manufactured by the same folks who make his streamer art, some have <strong>boycotted Highguard </strong>because of this impossible collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-dr-disrespect-fakes-highguard-invite">Dr Disrespect Fakes Highguard Invite</h2>



<p>On January 24, Dr Disrespect posted an image on social media of his desk, some streaming and gaming equipment, and an ID card that marked him as an attendee to the recent Highguard event in Los Angeles. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was a staging ground for Wildlight to showcase the all-new shooter in full to a wide audience of streamers, creators, pro gamers, and influencers, and some folks believed that Dr Disrespect also went.</p>



<p>When the image cropped up on social media, it took some who <strong>were </strong>in attendance mere seconds to debunk the image, simply by showing their own, legitimate passes, and pointing out the inaccuracies. But that wasn’t enough for the detritus of those social circles that avoid using logic and reasoning to solve something cryptic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many took to those same social circles to slam Wildlight for associating with a creator with Dr Disrespect’s reputation. Anyone even remotely interested in the creator space knows about the recent controversies that the scandalous streamer found himself embroiled in over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Now, the Creator Manager for Highguard at Wildlight Entertainment, Chin, has <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a definitive comment</a> on social media, further debunking the image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! I’m Chin, the Creator Manager for Highguard / Wildlight and I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, no, Dr Disrespect did not jet off to Los Angeles to play Highguard with everyone else. He is <strong>streaming </strong>the game as this article is being written, but that’s the closest to it he’ll ever be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-battle-pass-free-war-chest/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t have a new live-service game without a Battle Pass, and Highguard doesn’t advertise a properly labeled Battle Pass, to an extent. This guide covers how to get a free War Chest and how it relates to Highguard. </p>



<p>Everyone gets the ick at the mention of a Battle Pass due to the negative connotations. However, if something is free to play, it’s going to have a Battle Pass, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> complicates things with its War Chest system.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-a-battle-pass">Does Highguard Have A Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get playing. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has a fully fledged Battle Pass system under the guise of a War Chest.</strong></p>



<p>Same thing, different name. A War Chest is the name for the game’s Battle System. It has the Pages system that Fortnite and others have adopted in recent years, allowing you to have more freedom in how you accumulate Highguard rewards.</p>



<p>Each reward requires so much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard currency</a>, and they include the usual slew of live-service cosmetics: Skins, weapons makeovers, customizable player profile items, and more. Subsequent War Chests will presumably require real money or acquired in-game currency, but not the first one.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-war-chest-in-highguard">How To Claim Free War Chest In Highguard</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Generous. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to go into the Highguard Store, click on War Chest, and claim your free Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick step-by-step guide on what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up Highuard.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Make sure you’re on the tabs at the top.</li>



<li>Cycle across to <strong>Store</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Inspect War Chest</strong> in the corner.</li>



<li>Claim the War Chest.</li>



<li>You now have a free Battle Pass for Highguard Episode 1.</li>
</ol>



<p>The first War Chest has a total of 44 items to claim. Goodies vary in terms of rarity, and they’re spread across ‘4 Chapters.’ You need to play matches and rack up a serious amount of Vigil Tokens—which are used in exchange for the rewards found in the War Chest.</p>



<p>It’s expected that future War Chests will follow a similar format, unless there’s stern opposition from the Highguard community.</p>



<p>Will you endeavour to complete the first-ever Highguard War Chest, AKA Battle Pass? Or do you think the rewards are a complete waste of time and not worth the effort?

<p>The marketing train is in full swing for WWE 2K26.

<h2 id="h-last-gen-and-pc-status-remain-unknown">Last Gen and PC Status Remain Unknown</h2>



<p>There was no confirmation regarding the game’s availability on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. There was also no mention of WWE 2K26 on PC in Billbil-kun’s report.</p>



<p>Last year’s was available on the platform, but it was treated as a last-gen version of the game, meaning it didn’t include The Island. Also like</p>



<p>As far as what to expect from this year’s game, Insider Gaming was the first outlet to exclusively report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the feature superstar</a> for the game’s Showcase Mode.

		<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered, or DW3CER as no one is calling it, was set to be released on March 19th 2026, but that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>A message from producer Tomohiko Sho reads as follows:</p>


<p><em>“The release of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered has been postponed from the previously announced March 19th, 2026.&nbsp; As the first remaster of the Dynasty Warriors series,&nbsp; in order to satisfy our fans, we have made the decision to further improve the quality of the game. The new release date will be announced at a later date. We appreciate your patience as we take a little more time before the game releases”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered looks to retain the gameplay of the original game, but has been completely remade using Unreal Engine 5. The team has also reconsidered some of the gameplay and UI elements to refine the experience.</p>

<p>The remake includes the original game plus the Xtreme Legends expansion which includes more scenarios, officers such as Lu Bu, Meng Huo and Yuan Shao, four challenge modes and more weapons. That will boost the roster to over 40 officers who will be battling thousands of enemies all at once.&nbsp; Dynasty Warriors 3 was the first game in the series to feature mechanics that would become a mainstay for the series, such as True Musou Attacks, two-player simultaneous play, and the officer development system.</p>
<p>When it does eventually get released the game will be launching on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/</link>
            <guid>1416802</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a common trend in multiplayer games to have numerous currencies, and Highguard appears to be no different. As soon as you load into the game, you’ll see a selection of small symbols at the top right of your screen, indicating how much of each currency you own. </p>



<p>The thing is, when you’re loading into a new game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> for the first time, the whole experience can be overwhelming, and the last thing you want to figure out is which currencies can be spent where, let alone how to earn them!</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has you covered, as in this guide, you’ll find out everything you need to know about Highguard’s various currencies. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-currencies-are-in-highguard">How Many Currencies Are In Highguard?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are already plenty of bundles in the store. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are three currencies in Highguard, and each one has its own unique purpose. </strong></p>



<p>The currencies in question are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Highguard Gold</li>



<li>Warden Credits</li>



<li>Vigil Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>As is often the case, these currencies have their own rules: each one can only be spent in certain ways, they cannot be interchanged between one another, and they’re all earned in their own unique way. </p>



<p>But don’t worry, there’s no need for confusion, as Insider Gaming have broken down each currency for your convenience.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-gold-explained">Highguard Gold, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The bundles don’t come cheap. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard Gold is the premium currency of Highguard. It is used to purchase War Chests and Store Cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The main way to earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-launch-day-content-maps-content-weapons-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> Gold is through direct in-game microtransactions, with the prices shown above in GBP. As things stand, there are no other ways to earn the currency.</p>



<p>It’d be great to see it available through other means in the future, either via War Chests or perhaps even Ranked rewards, as plenty of other live-service games offer their premium currency as in-game rewards. Until then, though, if you see something you fancy in the store, you’re going to need to pull out the wallet.</p>



<h2 id="h-warden-credits-explained">Warden Credits, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Some simple cosmetics are on offer. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warden Credits are used to purchase cosmetics from the Trading Post, an in-game store that rotates its stock weekly.</strong></p>



<p>The Trading Post is similar to the Store, except it offers a smaller variety of cosmetics that can be earned without the need for microtransactions. That’s because Warden Credits can be earned in-game, either by completing challenges or simply playing games.</p>







<p>However, if you’re managing to accrue a lot of them, be warned, as Warden Credits are capped at 10,000. Once you hit this upper limit, you’ll stop storing them in the bank, so be sure to spend them!</p>



<h2 id="h-vigil-tokens-explained">Vigil Tokens, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Similar to a battle pass. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Finally, there’s Vigil Tokens. These are used to purchase items in War Chests, which are packed with various cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The primary way to earn these Vigil Tokens is simply by playing matches. The more you play, the more you’ll earn, so it’s a great incentive to reward regular players with some high-tier cosmetic items.</p>



<p>Similar to the Warden Credits, though, there’s an upper limit to how many you can hold onto. 3,000 is the maximum amount of Vigil Tokens you can have at one time, so once again, be sure to spend them when you get them!</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

And there’s at least one of the vinyl figures made of every single character in the history of pop culture. And while some find these facts annoying, there’s something to be said about a great-looking Funko Pop based on something you personally like. The latest Funkos to go up for preorder are based on Pokémon, and there are some bangers in here: an angry, electricity-summoning Pikachu, an angry, vine-summoning Venusaur, and more. Take a look and see if you want to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wB4Zp?object_uuid=e4307149-1afe-4077-8d0a-39deb7f32979&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder any from Amazon</a> ahead of release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémeon Funko Pops Up for Preorder</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The two centerpieces of this new batch of Pokémon Funkos are the aforementioned Pikachu and Venusaur. Both are Funko Pop! Premium figures, meaning they’re 4.5 inches tall, rather than the 3.75 inch height of standard Funko Pop figures. They’re also in more dramatic stances, as if sculpted in mid-attack. They look pretty great, even for a seasoned commerce editor like me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the upcoming Pokémon Funkos are standard Funko Pops. We have Ivysaur, Zoroark, Electabuzz, Magmar, and the adorable Goomy.

There’s just less stylization going on between the real thing (as depicted in the games) and the vinyl figures. They’re also made in eye-catching bright colors, so they look great wherever you decide to display them.</p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8lY5?object_uuid=e4307149-1afe-4077-8d0a-39deb7f32979&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If Pokémon isn’t your speed, you can likely find another upcoming Funko Pop that appeals to you more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this month, Wildlight Entertainment invited a whole host of media and content creators to take a hands-on look at <em>Highguard</em>–a 3v3 “raid shooter” whose big reveal was the closer to last month’s Game Awards. Reaction to that trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088"><span>decidedly mixed</span></a><span>. This article isn’t about my thoughts on the game itself, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">you can find here</a>, but rather what it felt like to attend an event for a game which was already being treated by some online as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>gaming’s next </span><i><span>Concord</span></i></a><span>. What’s it like to be one of the first people outside of the studio to play something that so many had already written off despite not really knowing what it was even trying to be?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137"><span>The </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i></a><span> Launch Event, as my lanyard calls it, was an all-day affair held in Los Angeles that was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Making the trek from Long Beach, I boarded my Lyft (paid for by Wildlight) at about 7:45 in the morning, and despite my best efforts at being punctual, didn’t arrive at the venue until about 9:15. Being stuck in a sea of cars on the I-110 gave me a lot of time to think about what the day ahead had in store.</span></p>

 <p><span>While players experiencing the game for the first time today will have an entirely different experience, myself and the other folks who experienced the game that day only had the TGAs trailer to base our expectations on, and it hardly told us anything about the game at all. None of us knew what a “PvP raid shooter” was, nor did we know anything about the moment-to-moment gameplay beyond a short description on the Steam store page: “From the creators of</span><i><span> Apex Legends</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>&nbsp;comes </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.”&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>9:16 AM – January 21 – NYA West, A Hazy Recollection, And Coffee #2 (and #3)</h2> <p><span>The first thing I noticed upon arriving was a faint feeling of deja vu. I’d been to this venue before, I thought. It took me a few moments to realize that I’d been in this same part of town for EA’s own preview event for </span><i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></i><span> back in 2023; I wondered if the members of Wildlight in charge of picking the place had still been at Respawn back then. After checking in at reception, I walked into a lobby filled with fellow members of the press from all over the world. I grabbed my second coffee of the day, some yogurt, and an apple Danish from an assortment laid out in front of me; besides the coffee I’d grabbed earlier that morning I hadn’t yet had any breakfast, and the longer-than-expected commute had me starving.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663168">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Conversing with other members of the press, I confirmed what I’d already assumed; none of us quite knew what we were about to play. Despite this, there was a quiet hope that perhaps the trailer was a misstep, and that the game itself might impress. I spoke with </span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée and another L.A. native freelancer friend of mine, Luis Joshua Gutierrez, among a few others, as I scarfed down my food and coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of the corner of my eye I noticed Geoff Keighley. The Game Awards host was the only person outside of the development team who might be able to answer our questions as to what exactly </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> is, as he’d played it the previous summer before asking the team to let him put it in his December showcase. Had he selected a surprise hit, or attached his brand to another live-service dud?. I downed Coffee #3.</span></p> <h2>9:52 AM – So, What On Earth Is A “PvP Raid Shooter,” Anyway?</h2> <p><span>The event running slightly ahead of schedule, we were shepherded into an auditorium. Once everyone had been seated, we got the whole spiel–who Wildlight are, how <em>Highguard</em> came to be, and what being a “raid shooter” actually entails. Roughly 4 years ago, when Wildlight was only about 5 members big, the team spent some time playing shooters all day in search of inspiration. As the team put it, “we were trying to figure out what the question was that we wanted our game to answer.” Inspiration itself came from the experience of riding to and raiding bases in </span><i><span>Rust</span></i><span>; the team wanted to figure out a way to distill those experiences into something repeatable, without all the busy prep work that survival crafting games require.</span></p>

 <p><span>Of course, everyone wanted to know why the team had opted for radio silence since the game’s reveal; the answer to that was twofold. We were given one half of the answer there and then, with the other coming just a bit later in the day. Originally the team had intended to shadowdrop the game, much as they had done with </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> when they had still worked at Respawn. As it so happened, the Game Awards trailer only came to fruition at the eleventh hour after Geoff Keighley had offered up the spot upon being impressed by the game during his personal demo earlier in the year.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663167"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663167">Kotaku / James Galizio</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In hindsight, given how complicated the game’s systems are to explain and the TGAs’ strict runtime, it’s little surprise the trailer struggled to land. The radio silence, then, was equal parts a return to the original plan as well as an acknowledgement that the game would perhaps best speak for itself. Still, rather than being tossed in entirely blind and letting the game make its own impression, press and influencers had to watch a thorough overview of the shooter’s mechanics and systems before getting our hands on the controllers and keyboards laid out for us.</span></p> <p><span>Entering the auditorium, I saw the venue was split in two halves. On the right were groups of PCs, 6 a piece, paired with some very expensive Dell 4K OLED monitors. While by default players could play with mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse, Wildlight quickly noted that anyone who wished to play with a controller could request either a PlayStation 5 Dualsense or an Xbox Wireless Controller, and they would bring one right over. On the opposite wall was a collection of 3D models of in-game assets, heaps of concept art showcasing the game’s world and its characters, and more.</span></p>

 <h2>11:30 AM – Probing the Vibes</h2> <p><span>With lunch scheduled for noon, I only had time for a handful of matches. </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>‘s Travis Northup had his first interview with the team scheduled early, leaving myself and the other member of our impromptu group–</span><i><span>GameSpot</span></i><span>‘s Jordan Ramée–to wander over to the art that caught our eye. I wondered how the artists that had drawn these felt about the reception to the game’s reveal.</span></p> <p><span>It occurred to me at this point that the event took up a great deal of space, especially when considering the modest number of press in attendance. There were a couple dozen of us, by no means a small amount, yet the venue was so large that it bordered on feeling empty. I wondered if the team had expected or planned for a larger audience when they’d booked the location; there was certainly room for double, maybe even triple the number of attendees. Maybe the crowd during the influencer session, held a day earlier, had been a lot bigger. I grabbed Coffee #4 from a concessions table while waiting for the lunch spread to be set up.&nbsp;</span></p>

As the day progressed, it was fascinating watching folks slowly come to grips with some of the intricacies of the gameplay loop. You can read my <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">hands-on impressions here,</a> or decide for yourself now that the full game is live.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>5:12 PM – Winding Down, and Cacio e Pepe Pizza</h2> <p><span>The event was set to go until 6PM, but with the memories of my agonizingly long ride to the event I had no intentions of grabbing my Lyft home right in the middle of L.A.’s notorious rush hour traffic. There were no plans for an afterparty, though we had been given per diem cards to help pay for food and other amenities and a few of us had the same idea<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span><span>we decided on grabbing some pizza and drinks from a bar close by that came recommended.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While waiting in line to order my first drink, I witnessed what felt like a microcosm for the day’s events as a whole when the bartender tripped up and spilled a drink order for one party. She quickly adjusted, repouring their beers and bringing them over successfully with the second attempt, ultimately no worse for wear. I doubt the two gentlemen who’d ordered them even remember the spilled drinks; I get the feeling that Wildlight is banking on something similar. If </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> can ultimately speak for itself, then will it matter in the end that they messed up with the reveal trailer? No one will remember. Well, except maybe Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Scanning through the menu, my eye was drawn to an unorthodox-sounding pizza flavor; Cacio e Pepe, like the pasta dish. Evidently I was the only one at the table that was familiar with the flavor, and we ordered the pie to give it a shot. It was delicious, and I’d only wish it hadn’t been devoured so quickly–I would have loved a slice or two for the ride home. Sometimes it’s good to take a chance on something different.</span></p>
