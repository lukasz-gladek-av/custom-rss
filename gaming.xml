                <p dir="ltr">Today, during Tennocon 2024, Digital Extremes debuted a new gameplay trailer for Warframe: 1999, a narrative-driven spin-off quest for Warframe set in the late 1990s. Along with some tubular action sequences, the trailer showed off a new boss fight where the most dangerous enemy might be the earworm that infects your real-world brain during the battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer kicks off in a deserted shopping mall, complete with old, clunky computers and an arcade lined with machines. A team of Protoframes, led by the main character Arthur, then pursue Dr. Entrati, who Warframe fans know as the first person to make contact with the Void that gives the Tenno their power.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336697" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336697"></a><figcaption>What backstreets are these boys from?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336698-1999_screenshot_excaliburvsarthur.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336699-1999_screenshot_enemies.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336700-1999_screenshot_tank_a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336701-wf_atomicycle_glamour_3840x2160.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336702-protoframe_group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336698,1300-4336699,1300-4336700,1300-4336701,1300-4336702" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336698-1999_screenshot_excaliburvsarthur.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336699-1999_screenshot_enemies.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336700-1999_screenshot_tank_a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336701-wf_atomicycle_glamour_3840x2160.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336702-protoframe_group.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336698-1999_screenshot_excaliburvsarthur.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336699-1999_screenshot_enemies.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336700-1999_screenshot_tank_a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336701-wf_atomicycle_glamour_3840x2160.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336702-protoframe_group.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trailer shows multiple action sequences that highlight the new Atomicycle vehicle, new weapons like the AX-52 rifle, and a fight against a massive tank set to late '90s nu-metal. We also get to meet Arthur's teammates, including Amir the brainiac, Aoi the logistics expert, and Quincy, a marksman whose Cyte-09 Warframe is new to the Warframe experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer ends with the introduction of Technocyte Coda, an Infested variation of an in-universe boy band called On-lyne. The group are introduced with their "hit single" called Party Of Your Lifetime serving as a backdrop--and the song is streaming now on all major real-world streaming platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Other updates coming to Warframe are new Ember and Rhino Heirloom skins, a new questline called The Lotus Eaters, and an anime short introducing the world of Warframe: 1999 in collaboration with London-based art studio The Line.</p><p dir="ltr">Warframe is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

Recent updates added a new “Enhance Audio” feature and better multiplayer support, joining other key updates over the last few weeks.</p><p>Developer Benjamin Stark (aka ZodTTD) told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that the Enhance Audio feature in his most recent update improves audio “using reverb and interpolation effects.”  He also “added Multitap emulation” for games that used Sony’s adapter that expanded the PS1’s controller port count from two to four. (That was used for games like <em>Crash Team Racing,</em> <em>NBA Jam: Tournament Edition</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Multitap">and more</a>.)</p><p>In other recent updates, Stark added analog stick support for games that used the Sony Dual Shock controller and the ability to switch discs without going back to the main menu for multidisc games like <em>Metal Gear Solid. </em>He also introduced a new “Pro” upgrade for $4.99 that turns ads off entirely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of TennoCon 2024, Digital Extremes held a media preview of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> content that would be unveiled during the Canadian convention. Chronologically, everything will begin next month with the release of the Prologue Quest called The Lotus Eaters. The developers described it as a 'micro-story' that follows directly from the events of <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-whispers-in-the-walls-and-beyond-qa-with-creative-director-rebecca-ford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whispers in the Walls</a> and sets the stage for Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The August update ships alongside the Sevagoth Prime, an enhanced form of the dark helmsman in signature gold trim and complete with exclusive weapons and accessories. The developers are holding the following update 'closer to the chest' and will only reveal it during the Tokyo Game Show (slated for September 26-29). The only thing they were able to say at this time is that it will include a new Warframe and some pretty substantial quality-of-life enhancements, such as a Caliban rework and free access to base Caliban. The truly big one, though, will be the newly added ability to favorite items in the UI. Additionally, the Fall update will introduce new Incarnons and the Companions 2.0 Part 2 overhaul.</p>
<p>In the gameplay footage, Hex squad leader Arthur Nightingale (codenamed Excalibur) and his ragtag team band together in an alternate version of Earth against Entrati. After a bit of bickering with the team (composed of Technician Amir Beckett, AKA Volt; Logistics Air Morohoshi, AKA Mag; Marksman Quincy Isaacs, AKA Cyte-09; Medic Leticia Garcia, AKA Trinity; and Arthur's sister, Psych-Ops Eleanor Nightingale, AKA Nyx), Arthur heads out onboard his Atomicyle bike, which is capable of drifting, bullet-jumping, and even acting as an impromptu explosive if you let it go and watch it crash into your enemies.</p>
<p>The Atomicyle clearly retains an arcade, stylish driving style, which fits very well with Warframe, and it can be seen doing all sorts of cool tricks. Eventually, though, Arthur has to dismount to fight the minions of Scaldra Commander Major Neci Rusalka before eventually getting into a boss fight with a tank. By the way, Digital Extremes confirmed the Atomicyle will be usable elsewhere in the game's open zones, too.</p>

<p>Following the defeat of the tank, Arthur closes in on Entrati's supposed location, only to meet face-to-face with the Excalibur Warframe, as you can see in the featured image. In the Q&amp;A portion, Digital Extremes also mentioned a series of Technocyte weapons to grind out.</p>
<p>The real kicker, though, is that the developers are adding a romance system with Warframe: 1999. Players will be able to send e-mail messages to other members of the Hex squad and eventually, if they 'play their cards right', even get a New Year's kiss. Interestingly, Digital Extremes also teased that somehow, a virus from 1999 will make it back to the Origin system, infecting the ship. Much to the joy of the community, the Infested Liches are finally coming to the game with the Technocyte Coda boyband and their single “PARTY OF YOUR LIFETIME” will be available to stream starting tomorrow on Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, fully voice acted and customizable Gemini Skins for Protoframes and base Warframes with exclusive emotes will be obtainable. Excalibur, Nyx, Cyte-09, Trinity, Mag, and Volt will all be able to use their respective Protoframes as Gemini Skins, meaning you could switch from Excalibur to Arthur Nightingale in the middle of the mission.</p>
<p>By the way, the Hex team's voice cast is very high-profile: Amelia Tyler (the narrator in Baldur’s Gate 3), Kevin Afghani (Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder), Melissa Medina (Zanuhali and Nitowikwe in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail), Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge (one of the available player voices in Forza Horizon 5), Alpha Takahashi (Hanako Arasaka in Cyberpunk 2077), and Ben Starr (Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI).</p>
<p>High-fidelity Heirloom skins for the Ember and Rhino Warframes won't be time-gated anymore. Ember's is available now, while Rhino's is coming in early 2025. Lastly, the studio is working with animation arthouse THE LINE on a Warframe: 1999 anime short that will be released this year.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have responded to the US Federal Trade Commission's assertion that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition">the tech giant are now offering a "degraded" Game Pass experience</a>, posing "exactly the sort of consumer harm" the FTC warned was possible in advance of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.
</p>
<p>Nuh-uh, say Microsoft, who call the FTC's letter "a misleading, extra-record account of the facts".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that the price of a PC Game Pass has risen from $9.99, €9.99 or £7.99 per month to $11.99, €11.99 and £9.99. They also introduced a new 'Standard tier' of Xbox Game Pass for console players, which is less expensive but doesn't include day-one access to new games. This is what the FTC are referring to when they talk about a degraded experience.
</p>
<p>"It is wrong to call this a 'degraded' version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering," says Microsoft's letter filed in response, as first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1814438299844382964">The Verge's Tom Warren</a>. "That discontinued product did not offer multiplayer functionality, which had to be purchased separately for an additional $9.99/month (making the total cost $20.98/month. While Game Pass Ultimate's price will increase from $16.99 to $19.99/month, the service will offer more value through many new games available 'day-and-date.' Among them is the upcoming release of Call Of Duty, which has never before been available on a subscription day-and-date."
</p>
<p>Microsoft's letter also argues that the FTC chose not to make the subscription service a pillar of their argument at trial, instead focusing on the possibility that Call Of Duty could be pulled from rival platforming, thus harming competition. That's not the case, Microsoft point out, as Call Of Duty "is not being withheld from anyone who wants it". They're also claiming that PlayStation's own subscription service "continues to thrive, even as they put few new games into their subscription day-and-date".
</p>
<p>I can make no legal comment on this public slapfight, but personally I feel that a higher price - or a lower price without the day-and-date feature that's clearly a cornerstone of Game Pass - constitutes a degraded consumer experience. That's not offset by multiplayer being included in the lower tier because, well, I play games on PC, where access to multiplayer is not typically gated by any subscription other than the cost of your internet. There therefore is no lower tier for PC Game Pass; it's simply more expensive than it used to be for fundamentally the same service. Boo, I say.</p>

        <p>And FlatOut 2 gets revived multiplayer</p>

    </div>

            <p>I like my car combat to be focused on collisions not guns, and for the vehicular argy-bargy to be an additional layer of excitement and strategy upon a racing core. FlatOut, then. A series of bumper car racing which managed to impress with its crumple zones long before the era of Wreckfest or BeamNG.
</p>
<p>Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I feel like FlatOut 2 might have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2990/view/4342116767579497687">the most communicative patch note of all time</a>: "Restored unused track: 'Papa Roach - Blood Brothers'". What more do you need to know about a game or the era in which it was made? Otherwise the sequel, and clearly the most beloved of the three, also gets the biggest sweep of new features, including new translations, improved support for widescreen monitors, and the forementioned multiplayer via OpenSpy.net.
</p>
<p>The first FlatOut's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/6220/view/4370264265339697534">patch notes are nearly as long</a>, including all of the above minus the multiplayer, alongside a different set of graphical tweaks and "minor fixes and improvements".
</p>
<p>FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/12360/view/4346620367298119035">patch notes</a> are the shortest, but don't be fooled. The latest update only adds Workshop support, but that's because the Collector's Edition released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/12360/view/4148449764353159269">back in March</a> already added the extra languages, stripped out Games For Windows Live DRM, and resulted in the game being Steam Deck verified.
</p>
<p>(Ultimate Carnage was initially an enhanced console port of FlatOut 2, with new tracks and modes, making it a kind of FlatOut 2.5. Don't mistake it for FlatOut 3, which was a different game from a different developer and widely hated.)
</p>
<p>I suspect, if all of these games are new to you, then really you should go play Wreckfest instead, the spiritual successor from FlatOut's original developer. But if you've played Wreckfest and want more of the same, I think FlatOut still has something to offer, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flatout-pc-review">as Adam explained back in 2016</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-reappears-with-story-gameplay-plans-to-come-to-more-players-this-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Digital Extremes has teased the opening moments of its highly-anticipated MMO.</h2></div><section><p>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has unveiled more gameplay for its upcoming fantasy MMO, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-is-the-next-game-from-warframes-digital-extremes-and-its-inspired-by-princess-mononoke">Soulframe</a>.</p><p>The studio pulled back the curtain on its next project during an inaugural dev stream as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u9M88FQQB0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TennoCon 2024</a>. It’s a closer look at some of the game’s opening moments, revealing customization features, new magical abilities, and combat. The footage also gives us a longer look at the players’ wolf-like mount and the Nightfold hub, where you can relax, customize your arsenal, and talk to NPCs, all with the press of a button. It shares some similarities with Warframe's Orbiter ship, and in case you were wondering, yes, you can pet your mount here.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/20/soulframe-screenshot-1721492496327.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Soulframe reappears with new gameplay at TennoCon 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>It all kicks off with a look at the Warsong Prologue, which higlights customization options for their mother's hair, skin color, eyes, and more as Soulframe begins. It reveals a taste of not only new features but also how themes of ancestry have been woven throughout the experience. This fully narrated intro sequence is then cut short as a time-skip launches us into the future, revealing what will eventually become each player's Envoy character.</p><p>We got an even better look at the importance of visuals in Soulframe thanks to the introduction of a new NPC: Verminia, the Rat Witch. Digital Extremes says this character can "enhance the customization of cosmetics" while also helping out with potions, elixirs, and more. Although the Envoy's abilities allows them to hurl their weapons at enemies and turn invisible for stealth approaches, Soulframe players will need more than brute force to take out large foes like Nimrod. This towering behemoth uses lightning abilities for ranged combat while using staff for close-quarters fights, and it looks like we'll be fighting them more than once.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The community we’ve formed around&nbsp;Soulframe<em>&nbsp;</em>has been really inspiring for the team and they are the backbone of everything we do.</p></div><p>“The community we’ve formed around <em>Soulframe </em>has been really inspiring for the team and they are the backbone of everything we do,” Soulframe Community Manager Sarah Asselin said in a statement. “We’re welcoming more new players than ever and we can’t wait to share our progress through regular Devstreams with the team as we continue to peel back <em>Soulframe’s </em>layers of intrigue.”</p><p>Today’s Soulframe gameplay should whet the appetite of both Warframe veterans and those who have never touched a Digital Extremes game, but there’s still a lot of waiting to do before it officially launches. However, during today’s TennoCon presentation, Digital Extremes promised plans to get its fantasy MMO in the hands of more players sometime this fall. As long as the plan goes unchanged, the studio says that anyone who wants to play Soulframe Preludes will be able to when they sign up.</p><p>“The closed testing we’ve been doing with our community has been so impactful; we’ve learned a ton, and we continue to listen and learn each day,” Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement. “We’re hoping to open this up to a lot more players this fall. Everything is still rough around the edges, but that’s part of our style - the feedback is important to us, and we really do iterate on it regularly.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Soulframe Warsong Prologue Fable Screenshots / Concept Art - TennoCon 2024</h3></div></output><p>We learned even more about Soulframe during our interview with Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, Crookes, and Asselin. During our talk, we gained insight into how the studio is keeping with its community-driven development approach, weapon variety, potential Warframe tie-ins, and so much more. Keep an eye out for the full interview to drop early next week.</p><p>Soulframe is launching first for PC with plans to come to consoles at an unspecified point in the future.

            <p>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has given us another peek at its upcoming free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG, Soulframe.</p>
<p>Back in July 2022, Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-announces-free-to-play-fantasy-action-mmorpg-soulframe">unveiled its first new property since Warframe's release</a> back in 2013. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-devs-free-to-play-fantasy-mmorpg-soulframe-shows-off-30-minutes-of-gameplay">Besides a 30-minute gameplay teaser this time last year</a>, though, we've seen very little else, but today DE has given us a closer look during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u9M88FQQB0">TennoCon 2024 fan convention</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>You can check it out towards the beginning of today's mammoth livestream:</p>

<p>Soulframe's development team took "centre stage for its inaugural Soulframe devstream". As well as meeting the team, we learned much more about the game's development, saw a little concept art, and learned how it listens to its community, as well as how its Soulframe Preludes have impacted development.</p>
<p>The gameplay shared showed how the physical attributes you choose for a mother impact how your character looks – which gives us a peek at the cinematic prologue – and then we're propelled forward to a point where we "get the next ancestor" and see our character in action with a little hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>While we still don't yet have a release date, creative director Geoff Crookes says the team hopes "to open this up to a lot more players this [autumn] (Q3)".</p>
<p>Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-hits-pause-on-deck-building-shooter-the-amazing-eternals">short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals</a>.</p>

<p>To get a Porxie of your own, you'll need to purchase "at least three" teas in a single transaction to secure your "unique code". From there, you can redeem it on the FF14 website.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">Square Enix has reportedly linked up with Tencent to develop a mobile version of its fan-favourite MMO, Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi recently said he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-would-prefer-to-keep-enjoying-final-fantasy-14-as-a-player-than-work-on-the-series-again">as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>

<p>The photomode can now be launched from the pause menu, and lets you fiddle with depth of field, focus control, and exposure times, as well as overlaying visual filters and altering weather conditions and time of day. Standard stuff now, as far as photomodes go, but very welcome in a game world as atmospheric Pacific Drive's hazily lit forests.

<p>Your new equippable car ability is the Juke Jet, which literally seems to be a small jet engine you can tape to both sides of your vehicle. It lets you horizontally dodge your car left or right, all the better to avoid obstacles looming out of the fog.
</p>
<p>Finally in the free update, there's two new nodes to unlock via the Fabrication Station on the garage upgrade tree. Those are the Smart Matter Deconstructor, which processes all the junk you collect but don't want, and the Vargas Auto-Pac-Vac, which will automatically "deposit materials into your transfer trunk".

<p>You can read about the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/4370264092250180290">new paid DLC over on Steam</a>. The cosmetic items don't interest me much, but the sale of these items is what's funding post-release free updates to the game. Of which there are more to come: this autumn they're planning on adding new difficulty modes, game customisation settings, and free cosmetics, with another as yet "redacted" update planned for the winter.

            <p>A game called "Hunt: Showdown 1896" has popped up on the ESRB website.</p>
<p>Although a follow-up to the acclaimed PvEvP bounty-hunting horror shooter from developer Crytek has yet to be formally announced, a <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/">rating</a> for Hunt: Showdown 1896 on the US' Entertainment Software Rating Board intimates either a sequel is on the way, or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">eagerly-anticipated update</a> scheduled to drop on 15th August is big enough to necessitate a new rating.</p>

<p>The listing – which states Hunt: Showdown 1896 has been awarded a Mature 17+ rating – hints at plenty of blood, gore, and violence, and tells us the game is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"This is a first-person monster-hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals," the summary says.</p>
<p>"Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape."</p>
<p>In May, we learned that Hunt: Showdown <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">was waving goodbye to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on 15th August</a>, but owners will be able to upgrade to the current-gen versions for free.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his Recommended review</a>.</p>

<p>FaZe Clan was recently eliminated from the running at the Esports World Cup, losing 0 – 2 against Natus Vincere and falling out of the tournament. The team left the competition with a $40,000 prize, but the loss threw extra concern in Robin ‘ropz’ Kool’s corner, with fans questioning where his mind was at as he landed his first negative event rating ever while flying the FaZe Clan banner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ropz-flops">Ropz Flops?</h2>



<p>Ropz is one of the most recognisable players in the Counter-Strike space. He’s an accomplished competitor with more than $1.4 million in the bank from CS winnings, and in the last year alone, he has claimed the top spot at several prestigious events:</p>



<ul>
<li>IEM Chengdu ($100,000)</li>



<li>CS Asia Championships 2023 ($250,000)</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship 2023 ($250,000)</li>



<li>IEM Sydney ($100,000)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S17 ($200,000)</li>



<li>Intel Grand Slam Season 4 ($1,000,000)</li>
</ul>



<p>During the Esports World Cup, ropz failed to go big, securing an HLTV rating of just 0.95, which is the lowest score he’s received in more than three years. In a breakdown, it was highlighted that in the last three months, ropz has managed to claw together an average rating of 1.07, which is quite a drop from his career average (1.15).</p>



<p>One major concern is that ropz has been slipping since Counter-Strike 2 was released. He has been outspoken on several occasions about the state of CS2, going so far as to say it sucks and he prefers CSGO, which was taken offline late last year to make room for the new version. As he’s getting increasingly frustrated, he seems to be losing motivation, and some fans have noted that he ‘still plays like it’s CSGO’. </p>



<p>Ropz was known as a solid movement-focused player, and it’s no big secret that Valve nerfed some of the more acquired movement tactics in CS2 – perhaps that has a lot to do with the downward trend. </p>

<p>It has been claimed online by Valorant leakers that the game’s ‘Agent 26’, whose identity is unknown at present, will be revealed on August 25. This unveiling will coincide with the final of Valorant Champions 2024. Riot Games hasn’t confirmed anything about the next Agent aside from offering a tiny nod to the new character in a recent trainer showcasing Abyss, the game’s newest map.</p>



<p>It has been more than four months since the last Agent – Gekko – was added to Valorant, and fans are hungry for something new.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-you-control-time">When You Control Time…</h2>



<p>In an image obtained by Valorant Updates on Twitter, it was indicated that Agent 26’s abilities will be centred around time control in some capacity. In the shot, we see thorny vines wrapping around and shattering sand timers, and there’s a glimpse of a chrome and neon rose. Could this indicate something geared more towards a female character with a penchant for controlling time?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It has been suggested that Agent 26 will be an Initiator, joining the line-up of those characters that are typically geared towards kicking off the action and uncovering enemies on the map. Here are the Initiators currently in Valorant for reference:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sova</li>



<li>Breach</li>



<li>Skye</li>



<li>KAY/O</li>



<li>Fade</li>



<li>Gekko</li>
</ul>



<p>It might seem strange for Riot Games to be introducing another Initiator so soon after the last one, but that’s for minds smarter than mine to figure out. Many players are calling for more Sentinels to be added, as presently, it’s the most underrepresented group in the game.</p>



<p>The claims are that Agent 26 will be revealed in full on August 25, when the final of the Valorant Champions 2024 tournament takes place. It makes sense, right?</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of The Warriors, I’m disappointed in you. In 1979, this low-budget action flick directed by Walter Hill was released, and it became a cult classic, doing well at the box office and achieving a timeless status despite featuring some stale dialogue here and there and having some issues behind the scenes. </p>



<p>It’s one of my favourite movies of all time, and in 2005, Rockstar Games released an authentic representation of the film in game form, bringing an expansive and highly entertaining title to fans everywhere. It builds on the universe kicked off by the 1979 movie and broadens the narrative immeasurably, and according to a recent report, Rockstar Games almost released a port of the game on an unlikely device.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-warriors-on-gba-suckah">The Warriors on GBA, <em>Suckah</em></h2>



<p>Rockstar Games came remarkably close to releasing The Warriors on Game Boy Advance. That’s what was recently claimed by former Rockstar Games employees close to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, which is where the original report surfaced regarding the GBA port. </p>



<p>In the report, it’s said that a former employee of Rockstar Leeds said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We were going for four-player co-op using the link cable and stuff. We finished the game. It was actually fun to play. But there it sits never to be released because that’s when the PSP was gaining momentum and we weren’t really seeing good returns on Nintendo. Nintendo at the time didn’t like promoting M-rated games. We were comfortable in Sony land, so we went with The Warriors direct port on PSP.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Warriors was a phenomenal game, letting players assume control of almost every member of the gang in a series of missions that transcended the basic timeline of the movie. In a ‘build-up phase’, players are shown the inner workings of the fictional gang that headlines the 1979 movie before transitioning to replicate the events as they unfolded in the film.</p>



<p>In The Warriors, there are also side modes that involve tagging areas with spray paint, and there’s an ‘arena’ mode of sorts that allows players to duke it out against other gangs in a ‘last man standing’ kind of environment. </p>



<p>Forget GTA 6, I want The Warriors 2.</p>

What better way to follow <a href="https://aftermath.site/anger-foot-dark-messiah-kick-button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a passionate plea for all games to have a kick button</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kick-button-all-games-moving-houses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the beginning of a revolution in which all games will</a> than by honoring the many flying feet that have come before? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we remember all the kicks that have knocked us flat over the years.</p><p>We begin the episode by discussing a week that feels like it’s lasted ten years, largely due to an assassination attempt against Donald Trump, the aftershocks of which have rattled every corner of the internet, including the world of video games. Almost immediately after it all went down, players of games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft </em>began <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digitally recreating the scene</a>. Companies, in turn, have moderated some instances of this and washed their hands of others. We reflect on <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it all means</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We also dig into some significantly more lighthearted topics, including the best kicks in video games and <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris’ espresso-centric mad science projects</a>. Then we, three people who are not licensed therapists, offer some extremely good mental health advice: <a href="https://aftermath.site/log-off-cross-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">log off</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can amass the time and resources necessary to retroactively add a kick button to every game that’s ever existed.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What kicks do you think best represent the form?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Most obvious is Chun-Li. I mean, that’s just all kicks.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I’ve thought about this, though, because how are we defining this? There’s a lot of games where you kick, like <em>Street Fighter</em>, like you just said, Chris. There’s a lot of kicking. But it feels like there’s a distinction between a game that features kicking and a game that specifically breaks down a kick button, like a first-person game. In a fighting game, you expect kicks. It’s standard. But a first-person shooter where you can kick a door down feels more special, more worthy of focusing on.</p><p>Otherwise, I would just say <em>Yakuza</em>. Because fuck, those kicks are awesome. You kick dudes into walls and stuff, and their faces break. It’s amazing. But I don’t think <em>Yakuza </em>qualifies. I think <em>Duke Nukem 3D </em>qualifies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think <em>Dying Light </em>has one of the best kicks, because it’s just a dropkick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It sends zombies flying off rooftops. Incredible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That usually ends with them hanging off a light post or something like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> has something similar. It’s not as well staged, but a few bad guys you run into, you can just kick ‘em. I think you kick doors down, when you’re running full speed?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s interesting, though, because I saw somebody talking about the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> kick, and they were like “It’s a really good kick, but it also feels at odds with my conception of Faith as a character. I didn’t really feel like she’s somebody who would kill people, and so I tried to avoid using that.” Because you could just kick dudes off buildings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>You can avoid every fight, I think, except a brief quicktime event battle with a boss. I’m pretty sure every other piece of combat can be avoided. But yeah, that’s the broader argument with <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>: The combat itself doesn’t fit the game. But if you do want to do it, the sliding kick and the dropkick in <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> are – if you can put aside the conflict between the mechanics and the character – very cool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It also just feels like a kick better fits any sort of game that’s very movement heavy. A kick arises from the legs, so you can jump right into it. Much harder to jump into a punch. Not impossible, but harder. And so anytime you slow that entire progression down and start to do hand-to-hand combat, it no longer feels in sync with the rhythm of the game. Which is another cool thing about kicks: They change the dynamic of the way that you’re fighting.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>A kick is more disruptive. You can come in and out of punches really quickly without disrupting your stance or the viewpoint, but for a kick, you have to be way more dedicated. And that’s why the coolest kicks you get in games – like the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> one, like the <em>Dying Light </em>one – they actually disrupt your view. The camera will jerk in a weird way or there’s a specific sort of animation focus on it where it’s like, for 0.8 seconds, the entire game is focused on this kick. That sort of immersion and dedication to the act is I think what lies at the heart of conversations like this. It makes something that sounds mundane actually really fucking cool and special and fun.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I do think that, historically speaking, kicks in FromSoft games have been bad. However, the kick in <em>Sekiro</em>, if I remember correctly, is really, really good. And kicks in <em>Elden Ring</em>, that wasn’t a good Ash of War, but then they introduced Dryleaf Dane’s weapons. He has one that’s fists and kicks, and then you later on get one that’s just kicks. And so kicks just got better, and now there’s an actual amulet you can get that is all kicks, basically. So it buffs your kicks, which makes it a very powerful move, because a lot of things count as a kick. So there are kick-based builds that are now fun in <em>Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Going back to what Luke was saying for a second, I agree that the disruption of a moment with a kick is really key to what makes it so much fun. Because I got into this in one of my pieces a little bit, but I do think there are a lot of things that are not explicitly kicks that could be considered akin to them. I included the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> shove, just because it’s a means of very forcibly relocating your enemies – making them go flying from one place to another place, or off a ledge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t know if I agree with that on a basic level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’m building to a broader point here, though. You could also put, like, the Fus-Ro-Dah from <em>Skyrim </em>in a similar category <em>if </em>you were categorizing it this way. But, in both those cases, you do not have a giant foot coming out of nowhere to deliver that force and, as you were saying, Luke, disrupting your field of view – causing everything to shake and move in this tangible way. I think you can make both arguments, but sometimes you just want the big foot to appear.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I’m a foot purist. I think I’m really a foot purist. I don’t think it counts if you use your hands. That’s a different thing.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Here on Aftermath Hours, we’re all foot guys.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I’m not. But I am a purist when it comes to the form. I think it being a concussive or pushing thing is a venn diagram of, there are many foot things that involve pushing, but there are many foot things that also involve striking, and so I think it can encompass both of them, but it’s sort of a logical fallacy to believe that all things involving pushes are implicitly kicks. It doesn’t make sense logically to me. But I understand the spiritual gameplay mechanic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think I mean more in the sense that, when we’re talking about games, some of the most enjoyable parts of a kick often involve people being sent flying backward and that forcing them to traverse terrain in a way they were not expecting – or being pushed onto new terrain, or being harmed by a wall, or a spike trap or whatever. And so, as a result, these other motions that kind of accomplish something similar feel like kicks to me, because that’s what kicks in games so often do. It’s the purpose they actually serve, mechanically.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think <em>Bayonetta</em>’s got a lot of good kicks. Does<em> Devil May Cry</em> have a boot thing? I forget. It’s been a minute since I played the last DMC game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I feel like <em>God Hand</em> has some good ones.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> <em>God Hand</em> has a lot of good kicks. Anything in that lineage, I think, is going to have a pretty good kick. But <em>Bayonetta</em>’s all legs, so it’s gonna happen. And by extension, <em>Smash Bros</em> has some good kicks, I think. Doesn’t Ganondorf have one where he lifts his leg up and slams it down?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He has a similar move set to Captain Falcon, so he has his own version of the Falcon Kick.&nbsp;</p><p>Did either of you play <em>Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</em>? That was the game that sealed the deal for me in terms of being a video game kick appreciator. It was such an interesting game for its time, because I believe it was running on the Source Engine, and it came out not long after <em>Half-Life 2</em>. But it was pretty radically different. It was not a shooter; instead it was a first-person melee sword-and-shield brawler game, with some magic. It was kinda immersive sim-y, but a little bit removed from that.&nbsp;</p><p>And yeah, it just ruled. The combat was very detailed and hard hitting in first person, which you still don’t see that much of and definitely didn’t see that much of back then. I remember back then it was, like, that and <em>Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</em> if you wanted really good first-person melee combat. But what <em>Dark Messiah</em> had going for it was this amazing kick. Opponents would cover up a lot, so then you’d kick them, and because the game was Source-based, it was very physics-y. And so if there was somebody standing next to stairs and you kicked them, they’d go tumbling down and ragdoll around.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Source had the best fucking physics.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep. It was amazing. And then enemies would climb back to their feet, but what this game got right is, instead of them just being perfectly OK after that terrible experience, your enemies would be pretty beat up from falling down the stairs. And then they’d drag themselves at you very slowly in this honestly pretty pitiful way. But when you’re in that mindset already, you’re like “Hahaha, I feel so evil.” That, to me, is the best kick in video games.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Digital Extremes invited Wccftech to a recent media preview of TennoCon 2024, where we got to watch today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tennocon-2022-roundup-new-mmo-soulframe-announced-veilbreaker-teaser-trailer-duviri-paradox-details-announced-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a> presentation in advance.</p>
<p>The presentation started with a first look at the character customization process, where players will be able to choose the physical traits of their mother (complexion, hair, eyes, etc.) to determine their own. The player character's mother is a Night Maiden, a role that was described as a ward of different counties in the part of the world where the game is set.</p>
<p>The developers then moved to discuss the Warsongs Prologue, a Fable introducing the world, its characters, and beasts. It's a sneak peek at an experimental approach to choices and character design. As an Envoy, players must heal the Ode curse to restore the forgotten culture and memories to the beings of Alca.</p>
<p>Ancestry is a big theme in Soulframe. Players will gather various Ancestors in the Nightfold (a sort of parallel dimension) to make use of their skills. In the presentation, Digital Extremes introduced Verminia, the Rat Witch, who can enhance the customization of cosmetics while also assisting in crafting potions, elixirs, and other tinctures. Interestingly, we got confirmation that you can go back to the Nightfold from anywhere in the world as long as there is no enemy in the vicinity, which will allow you to craft things easily or just change gear as needed.</p>

<p>Digital Extremes is calling Soulframe's structure Overworld, a 'very large' overworld. Later, during the Q&amp;A, I asked for a comparison with Warframe's open zones and was told that just the starting island is twice as big as the Plains of Eidolon. Still, the studio is spending much time on adding content density rather than just focusing on map size.</p>
<p>The developers also provided a first look at a new enemy called Nimrod, who manipulates thunder and lighting while wielding a devastating tesla-coiled melee staff.</p>
<p>We then learned that the next game from Warframe's developers will launch in some form of early access later this year. Preludes (the current Pre-Alpha build) is going to be opened to everyone at some point this Fall, though the developers warned it might be rough at first, just like Warframe when it launched in 2013. Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The closed testing we’ve been doing with our community has been so impactful; we’ve learned a ton, and we continue to listen and learn each day. We’re hoping to open this up to a lot more players this Fall. Everything is still rough around the edges, but that’s part of our style - the feedback is important to us, and we really do iterate on it regularly.</em></p>
<p>There will be some Founder's Packs things, but Digital Extremes will try to make it 'less exclusive' than Warframe's.</p>
