            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">unpopular Game Pass price hikes</a> have caught the attention of Lina Khan. The former head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took to social media on Friday to once again criticize the company’s acquisition of <em>Call of Duty</em> maker Activision Blizzard. “As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences,” she wrote just a day after the price of Game Pass Ultimate rose to $30 a month.</p> <p>It was Khan’s FTC during the Biden Administration <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">that sued Microsoft to prevent the $70 billion Activision Blizzard deal</a> from going through. The regulator argued that further market consolidation in gaming would harm consumers, and ended up taking the matter to court. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of Microsoft, but that hasn’t stopped Khan and others from criticizing the outcome in the years since.</p>

 <p>“Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers,” she posted on X today alongside a chart showing Game Pass prices doubling since the trial concluded. “As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. </p> <p>As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. </p> <p>As dominant firms become… <a href="https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL">https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL</a></p> <p>— Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A similar point was made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-ftc-black-ops-6-appeal-1851599323">when Microsoft raised prices last year</a>. “Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FTC wrote</a> last July when it was still appealing the merger.”</p>

 <h2>Microsoft promised regulators Game Pass prices wouldn’t go up</h2> <p>Khan isn’t the only one going “I told you so” this week. Shortly after the latest Game Pass price hikes were announced, players started circulating the company’s old quotes back during the Activision merger fight. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority also tried to block the deal over pricing concerns.</p>

 <p>“Game Pass prices will not increase as a result of the Merger, and certainly will not increase to a point that offsets the substantial benefits of Activision titles coming to Game Pass on a day and date basis,” the company <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-insists-game-pass-prices-will-not-increase-as-a-result-of-activision-merger/">claimed back in 2023</a>. “This is especially so given Game Pass will continue to be constrained by B2P [buy to play].”</p>

 <p>In the years since, Microsoft appears to have done exactly that, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass</a> but jacking up the price as well, even though players can still choose to buy the game à la carte for $70 on console and PC.</p> <p>Microsoft might argue that $30 a month is a fair price to pay for subscription-based access to <em>Black Ops 7</em> and hundreds of other games. It’s impossible to know without access to rest of the Xbox math, most of which Microsoft stopped reporting to the public years ago. All we know is that according to Microsoft, Game Pass was profitable and generating $5 billion in revenue a year, even before the latest price hikes.</p>

There are plenty of powerful guns and equipment to try, as we went over in our best BO7 loadouts guide but you'll also want to make sure you have the best perks to suit your playstyle. In this guide, we'll discuss the recommended perks and Wildcards, and we'll also break down how the new Combat Specialties work this year.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</a><ul><li><a href="#Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</a><ul><li><a href="#Hybrid_Combat_Specialties">Hybrid Combat Specialties</a></li><li><a href="#Core_Specialties">Core Specialties</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV when moving, planting, defusing, or controlling Scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. This can also be a smart pick if you're planning on making a class to lay low with a sniper rifle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja: </strong>Move more quietly. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost and Ninja are both in the same perk slot this year, so you <strong>can't equip them both</strong> for a stealth loadout unless you choose the Perk Greed Wildcard, as mentioned below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded: </strong>Undetectable by AI targeting and thermal optics. Player-controlled scorestreaks don't highlight you. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as a Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch in a pinch, as Black Ops 7 features plenty of lethal scorestreaks that can target you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Flak Jacket:</strong> Reduces incoming explosive and fire damage. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Flak Jacket is a solid pick if you're an objective player looking to jump on a Hardpoint or Domination flag. It will help protect you from the grenades lobbed your way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846"></a><figcaption>The D.A.W.G. scorestreak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Looper:</strong> Gain the ability to re-earn Scorestreaks in the same life. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">By default, you can't keep earning your streaks in the same life, and you need to die to reset them. Looper allows you to keep earning your streaks over and over. This is a good perk if you're someone who can rack up plenty of points and want to keep earning streaks.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed remain so important in Black Ops 7's fast-paced multiplayer. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Reduced weapon motion and full ADS on slides, dives, and wall jumps. Take less fall damage. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the most popular pick for the third perk slot. Dexterity is what you'll want to equip to make the most of Black Ops 7's omnimovement while engaging in gunfights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker:</strong> See rough locations of nearby enemies on your minimap and see their footsteps in the world. Aiming down sights auto-pings enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't care as much about the movement aspects, Tracker is a great perk for getting more intel. This perk lets you follow highlighted footsteps and hunt your enemy on the map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Bankroll is great if you normally struggle to earn streaks or just want to give yourself a boost to earn them faster.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's Wildcard system returns in Black Ops 7. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize and make your loadout feel even more powerful. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill: </strong>Equip any non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill lets you run an additional primary weapon. This is great for pairing something slow, like a sniper rifle or marksman rifle, with something faster, like a submachine gun. This lets you be prepared for more situations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter: </strong>Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Gunfighter lets you add three more attachments to create a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 includes a Specialty Bonus system similar to Black Ops 6. The three perks you select for your loadout will determine your Combat Specialty. Equip three perks of the same category to activate the Enforcer (red), Recon (blue), or Strategist (green) Combat Specialty bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can now activate Hybrid Combat Specialties when pairing perks of different categories. As long as your loadout includes at least two perks of the same color, you're guaranteed to unlock a Hybrid Combat Specialty.</p><p dir="ltr">Any of these specialties can be a nice addition, but see what bonus might fit your playstyle. It may or may not be worth it to tailor your perks toward the specific bonus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579848-hybridcombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579848" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579848-hybridcombat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579848"></a><figcaption>Tactician Hybrid Combat Specialist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579848-hybridcombat.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Hybrid_Combat_Specialties">Hybrid Combat Specialties</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hybrid Specialty: Scout (Red and blue perks)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Scout is an offense and stealth hybrid.

Additional eliminations during this period reset the timer.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hybrid Specialty: Tactician (Red and green perks)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Tactician is a support and offense hybrid. When you earn assists, you'll also earn bonus score from bullet eliminations for ten seconds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hybrid Specialty: Operative (Blue and green perks)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Operative is a stealth and support hybrid.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in its robust 50-year history, GAMA has announced some major changes. The trade organization known for hosting Origins Game Fair and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA Expo</a> will be rebranding and announcing a new ten-year plan towards the health of the global tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The New GAMA Ten-Year Project</h2>

<p>According to an in-depth report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/02/gama-unveils-10-year-plan-to-become-epicenter-of-global-tabletop-gaming-industry-renames-itself-after-almost-50-years/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the new ten-year project for GAMA is for the organization to become the new epicentre of the global tabletop industry. This project encompasses a comprehensive range of plans to enhance GAMA membership globally and diversify its financial support, shifting its focus from solely sponsoring tabletop expos to leading the conversation on industry sustainability.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-expo-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=EfYgj4we 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-expo-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=DAW_X9Pu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, GAMA's plan will continue their ongoing advocacy within the tabletop space, such as its lawsuits <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">against the Trump administration's</a> disruptive trade tariffs and their wholesome promotion of the board game hobby through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-brings-game-store-day-to-flgs-retailers-this-november" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Store Day</a>.</p>

<p>The plan was spearheaded by President Nicole Brady. According to Brady, this shift was to allow the organization to manage important issues better long-term than "playing whack-a-mole" on a case-by-case basis. It was during an online "town hall" meeting that Brady articulated the future of the organization as a global one that treats the industry as more than just a hobby.</p>

<p>This push for formal organization and management is the impetus for the organization's new name. While originally known as the Game Manufacturers Association, the organization will now be known as GAMA: The Tabletop Association. As an official statement from the organization reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The tabletop game industry has grown far beyond where we were in 1977 when we were founded. Our new name honors that evolution while maintaining our legacy of nearly 50 years of serving the tabletop industry.&nbsp;We’re excited to move forward under a banner that celebrates the full spectrum of our industry and the people who shape it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for immediate plans, GAMA's focus in the next two years will be on an anti-counterfeit initiative, education and certification programs, providing professional resources, and reaching out to media about business-relevant topics.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn’t a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer’s battles are mostly straightforward, and it’s got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let’s go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you’ve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn’t be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you’ll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can’t complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn’t cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you’ll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you’ll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn’t when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you’ll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don’t just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It’s much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy’s health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it’s pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you’ll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn’t carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>

                <p>Just because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days</a> sale doesn't officially start until October 7, it doesn't mean you can't start saving early. As with any flagship sale at Amazon, great deals start going live days ahead of the actual event, and we're already finding a few worthwhile offers popping up at the online retailer. That includes over $100 off the Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle, which not only comes with a no-ads version of the tablet itself, but also a keyboard case and a stylus (which you probably would've ended up buying separately, anyway). The <a href="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">64GB No Ads bundle</a> normally starts at $370, but with Amazon's early Prime Big Deal Days discount, you can pick it up for just $236.49. Alternate configurations of the bundle are also discounted ahead of Prime Big Deal Days, as well as a few other Amazon Fire Tablet models, which we've rounded up below.</p><div title="6535126 - Fire Max 11 Prime Big Deal Days" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4527" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535126 - Fire Max 11 Prime Big Deal Days" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amazon.com\/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen\/dp\/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Amazon Fire Max 11 Tablet Productivity Bundle (64GB - No Ads)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amazon.com\/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen\/dp\/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-throughout-lockscreen/dp/B0DPJDYX61?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$236.49 (was $370)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This Amazon Fire Max 11 bundle comes with the 64GB, ad-free version of the tablet, as well as a keyboard case and stylus, which is essentially everything you need.

You can also save on older models like the Fire HD 10 32GB, which is half off at $70 (normally $140), or pick up the Fire HD 8 Plus 32GB for just $75, saving you nearly $100 compared to its standard $170 price.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jumping out of the Netflix animated movie and into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the KPop Demon Hunters have arrived for some Demon Rush, a new Halloween month riff on Horde Rush.</p>
<p><iframe title="KPop Demon Hunters Takes Over Fortnite" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>KPop Demon Hunters has been a huge hit on Netflix, an animated movie from the studio behind Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse that sees a trio of demon hunting KPop stars face off against demons that are now starting to fight them at their own game. It features the performances of Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung of Twice for the musical numbers, with the film’s soundtrack having plenty of success in its own right.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;Demon Rush is a limited time event, a revamped version of Horde Rush that sees Rumi, Mira, and Zoey fight endless waves of demons, and with KPop Demon Hunters inspired perks to use. The mode is available from 2nd October through 1st November.</p>
<p>Of course, this spills over to the Battle Royale and Blitz modes, with Rumi, Mira and Zoey outfits, accessories and emotes in the Fortnite Shop, and new new items available by completing quests including Rumi’s Sword and Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon.</p>

<p>And the tie in also extends to both Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative, using the assets for this movie tie in for their own creations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kingmakers</em> was due out in Early Access in just a few days but it’s apparently not ready yet. The medieval sandbox shooter has been indefinitely delayed as the team at Redemption Road works on getting everything working as intended. “We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Friday.</p> <p>Odds are you’ve seen a <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937">bit of <em>Kingmakers</em> here or there</a> over the years, even if you didn’t know it. The multiplayer game features sprawling maps and giant armies and is supposed to facilitate real-time destruction as you engage in everything from medieval combat to blowing up a bunch of armor-clad knights with tanks. The game’s impressive physics simulation helped it go viral on social media, land a big trailer at Summer Game Fest this year, and become the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam. So it’s surprising to see it pulled from launch at the last minute.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/HhiDBLQrOS">pic.twitter.com/HhiDBLQrOS</a></p> <p>— Ian Fisch – Lead Coder on Kingmakers (wishlist!) (@Ian_Fisch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled<em> Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible,” the team <a href="https://x.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537">announced today</a>. “We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.”</p>

 <p>The rest of the message goes on to try to explain why the game is being indefinitely delayed. TL;DR:<em> Kingmakers</em> is ambitions and delivering on that is hard!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA6, but you're dropped in the 1400s.<br>No cops. Just the angry knights you ran over 🚗 <a href="https://t.co/tLmQjUgmM3">pic.twitter.com/tLmQjUgmM3</a></p> <p>— Kingmakers ⚔️ (@Kingmakers_Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1929956825589584144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from an AAA third-person shooter,” Redemption Road states. “When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.”</p> <p>The studio doesn’t really go into much more detail than that but promises that a deep-dive overview will be livestreamed soon to update players on where things are at. That makes it sound like the delay won’t just be a couple of weeks or months. Will it still be out before the end of 2026? We’ll see. “We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent,” the developers wrote.</p>

Kratos' initial Greek-inspired revenge story was one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps2-games">best PS2 games of all time</a>, while his powerful redemption arc in the more recent Norse soft reboot earned first place on our list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps4-games">best PS4 games</a>. I'd go so far as to say Kratos is one of PlayStation's most recognizable mascots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to catch up on all of the adventures Kratos has taken, or simply want to revisit the God of War games you loved in the past, you'll be able to play most of them on your current-gen PlayStation 5. Here's what you need to know. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many God of War Games Are There on PlayStation 5?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War: Ragnarok is the only game in the series that has launched during the PS5 generation. However, there are a total of <strong>six God of War games available to play on the current-gen console</strong>. This includes all six mainline entries in the series, which span from God of War (2005) to God of War Ragnarok (2022). Two of those games relies on backward compatibility, while three of the earlier titles require a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games">PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two God of War spin-offs on PSP, Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta, are not currently available on PS5. Here's to hoping that Sony will eventually add these two well-received portable games to PlayStation Plus.</p><div catalogid="622d6e82-9d6e-4fe2-9fc0-5c878daf6f75" id="228765"><div id="228765" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>God of War: Ragnarok</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Every God of War Game on PlayStation 5 in Release Order</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">God of War III Remastered (2010)</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zn5e4b?object_uuid=14ce168e-1a3e-4a3f-998f-c8436592da6f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See on Amazon</a> (PS4) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/god-of-war-3-remastered-review">God of War III Remastered</a> serves up visual and performance improvements to the third mainline game, which also serves as the final entry in Kratos' Greek saga. In it, Kratos climbs Mount Olympus as he seeks to reach its zenith and bring his full might down upon the gods who wronged him. This provides a satisfying end to his original character arc that began with God of War (2005), making it essential for truly understanding the emotional stakes of 2018's soft reboot. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">God of War (2018)</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqYpY?object_uuid=14ce168e-1a3e-4a3f-998f-c8436592da6f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See on Amazon</a> (PS4) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/12/god-of-war-review">God of War (2018)</a> gives one of its most aggressive and venegeful characters in gaming a true redemption arc as well as an all-new combat system. In this wildly successful and emotionally potent soft reboot, Kratos has left the Greek pantheon and traveled to the Norse realm where he's now tasked with raising his young son, Atreus, while attempting to hide his past. But as the duo fight through a harsh and unforgiving land, Kratos is forced to face the truth that there remain parts of his nature he can't surpress if he wishes to protect those he loves most.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">God of War Ragnarok (2022)</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7b2P?object_uuid=14ce168e-1a3e-4a3f-998f-c8436592da6f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See on Amazon</a> (PS5) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up about three years after God of War (2018), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a> sees Kratos and Atreus forced to take on the Norse pantheon in an attempt to stop the complete destruction of the nine realms. Ragnarok's story continues to deal with larger themes of familial trauma and identity as Kratos comes to terms with his son becoming a young man while also trying to figure out what's next in his own journey for true redemption. This entry features a larger world to explore and more combat options, as well as many more characters used to fill out a more expansive narrative.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Available God of War Games on PlayStation Plus Premium</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The remainder of the God of War games require you to have a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription.

Until developer Santa Monica Studio makes a formal announcement, though, it's best to take it all with a grain of salt. Otherwise, the God of War franchise is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-dualsense-ps5-controller-where-to-buy">new limited edition PS5 controller</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Billy Givens is a freelancer at IGN with over a decade of experience writing gaming, film, and tech content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hori has announced another addition to the ever-growing list of cheaper alternatives to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo’s $90 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>. The Wireless Horipad Turbo is around $35 cheaper than Nintendo’s, and while it lacks a lot of premium features such as Amiibo support and the ability to remotely wake the Switch 2, it adds a lock button on the back that disables the buttons in the middle of the controller. That includes the Home and Screenshot shortcuts so they won’t do anything if accidentally pressed in the middle of a game.</p><p>The Wireless Horipad Turbo is currently <a href="https://horistore.com/shop/g/gnsx-126/">available for preorder in Japan through Hori’s online store</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FRM1SR6Z?th=1">Amazon Japan</a> for 7,980 yen, or about $54, in mist black, aquasian, shine yellow, frost white, and ruby magenta color options. It’s expected to launch before the year is out. There are no details on when or if it may see a US release, or if pricing will be comparable if it does, but it will be compatible with all versions of the Switch.</p><p>Aside from the use of translucent housing, the Horipad Turbo looks very similar to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller, including the game chat button located between the D-pad and right analog joystick. Hori has opted for drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance</a> (TMR) joysticks instead of Hall effect or capacitive options, which alone could make it more appealing than Nintendo’s gamepad. But the company has also skipped other features, including a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You will find an extra set of buttons on the back of the Horipad Turbo, and the company has gone the extra mile by allowing you to remap the functionality of the action, shoulder, and trigger buttons, as well as the D-pad and joysticks. You can even reprogram a single button to replicate the functionality of two others simultaneously, and you can activate rapidfire using an additional button on the front of the gamepad featuring the red, white, and blue Hori logo.</p><p>The lock button on the back of the Horipad Turbo can be toggled between disabling the Hori, Home, and Screenshot buttons. There’s also an option that locks the plus and minus buttons, ensuring you won’t pop into a menu screen at an inopportune time with an accidental press.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every time Taylor Swift, the country star turned pop royalty, releases a new album, it’s a cultural event, whether you’re a Swiftie or not. This is because the algorithm will no doubt feed you reactions and commentary just because you are, at most, one degree removed from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a> <span>star’s fandom at all times. </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is Swift’s 12th album, and turns the dial back into radio/TikTok-ready pop after </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department </span></i><span>went for a more melancholic, folky sound. But is it any good? Well, Swifties are sorting through their feelings.</span></p> <p><span>Like most of Swift’s work, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is pretty transparent in its references to her personal life. As that personal life has become so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>well-known in and out of her music</span></a><span>, it’s usually pretty obvious who a song is about. So there’s some lore to unpack with a lot of these songs, but the ones that are getting the most attention right now are the ones that seem to reference her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-ring-reaction-2000620394"><span>fiancé Travis Kelce’s hog</span></a><span> and seem to escalate an apparent feud between her and pop star Charli XCX that, at least publicly, appears largely one-sided at the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the song that is all about how well-endowed the Kansas City football player is. “Wood” starts out with a funky riff and a catchy beat, and you can already hear the Sabrina Carpenter influence in the composition. Then you hear the lyrics and you can tell that Swift is trying to emulate the </span><i><span>Short n’ Sweet </span></i><span>singer’s trademark graphic, sexual punchlines. Here, let’s look at the lyrics of the second verse.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Forgive me, it sounds cocky</span></p> <p><span>He ah-matized me and openеd my eyes</span></p> <p><span>Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see</span></p> <p><span>His lovе was the key that opened my thighs</span></p> <p><span>Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet, mm</span></p> <p><span>To know a hard rock is on the way</span></p> <p><span>And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious</span></p> <p><span>The curse on me was broken by your magic wand</span></p> <p><span>Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck</span></p> <p><span>New Heights of manhood</span></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If the clear reference to Kelce’s </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>podcast wasn’t enough to make it clear that this is about her man’s schlong, the reference to a “hard rock” like the one on her finger would make it pretty clear. There’s an episode of </span><i><span>How I Met Your Mother </span></i><span>in which Marshall (Jason Segal) realizes he can’t tell any sexy stories from his dating life to his friends without everyone knowing they’re about his long-time partner Lily (Alyson Hannigan) because she’s the only one he’s really been with. Part of what makes love songs such a popular genre of music is that there’s a universality to them that people can project onto their own relationships. Who among us wouldn’t love to sing about a man’s dick lifting a curse and solving all our problems? But Swift’s very public personal life and clear references to her husband-to-be mean that I can’t hear this song without knowing whose dick it’s about.</span></p>   <p><span>That being said, the song is pretty catchy. What Swift may lack in Carpenter’s clever jokes, she makes up for in a fun song about love and lust. And hey, Kelce seems cool with it?</span></p>   <p><span>One song I have a less charitable read on, however, is “Actually Romantic,” which takes the other side of “everyone knowing your business” and seems to be essentially a diss track against Charli XCX. For those who don’t know, Charli has a song called “Sympathy Is a Knife” on the album </span><i><span>Brat</span></i><span> that addresses her insecurities in the pop girl space, and seemingly references Swift specifically triggering those feelings of comparison in her. “Actually Romantic” is being called a diss track aimed at the “360” singer, and at first blush, some think Swift may have straight-up misunderstood the intent behind “Sympathy Is a Knife,” which is actually fairly complimentary to her.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>However, “Actually Romantic” does seem to gesture at further drama behind the scenes, even as Swift has been publicly supportive of Charli. Specifically, it references Swift’s past relationship with Matty Healy of the band 1975, which also includes Charli’s husband George Daniel, and things Charli has allegedly said about Swift in private.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</span></p> <p><span>Some people might be offended&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But it’s actually sweet&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All the time you’ve spent on me.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I guess I can buy that maybe there’s more happening than “Sympathy Is a Knife” lets on. It’s giving </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span> era, when Swift was very publicly calling out other public figures like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, or </span><i><span>1989</span></i><span>’s “Bad Blood” which referenced her now-ended feud with pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-womans-world-music-video-pokemon-pikachu-1851590464"><span>Katy Perry</span></a><span>. Again, it’s the effect of someone’s personal life being so public that these songs end up weaving a story that’s already playing out on social media and in gossip magazines. Though if this is all spun off from “Sympathy Is a Knife,” then it feels like punching down.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is that Swift’s status as a billionaire mega-celebrity clashes against the “relatable” persona she exhibits in her music here more than ever before. “Eldest Daughter” laments how mean everyone on the internet can be, when she’s enveloped in a massive cocoon of wealth and status. Like, girl, why are you even reading TikTok comments when you could be doing literally anything else with all that money?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU">https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU</a> <a href="https://t.co/quyrERr07R">pic.twitter.com/quyrERr07R</a></p> <p>— grace spelman (@GraceSpelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1973974944607580252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another song that really sticks out as an expression of Swift imagining threats to her status is “CANCELLED!” which I saw someone say is destined to become the new anthem of MAGA wine moms, and I can’t stop thinking about it. As the title suggests, the song is all about perceived judgments of her for who she chooses to associate with, with her singing that she likes her friends “cancelled” and cloaked in “scandal.” Broadly, this could be a song about cancel culture and how Swift is unwilling to drop people just because they run afoul of public scrutiny, but given that she has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1n4fj0i/taylor_swift_celebrates_brittany_maga_mahomes/"><span>friends who are public Trump supporters</span></a><span>, that feels like underselling or minimizing people’s criticism as some kind of petty scandal, rather than a legitimate concern.</span></p>   <p><span>Ultimately, all of these reactions are born from the relationship with her fandom that Swift has cultivated over her decades-long career. When your personal life is the source of the characters and stories people listen for references to in each song, every album is like a new season of a television show for which millions of people tune in just to lap up every new lore drop. But is the music any good? In my first listen, I came away thinking that </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is an obvious low point in Swift’s discography. I don’t think I’m alone in that assessment, but the album has been out for all of 12 hours at this point, and people will sort their feelings out over the next few weeks or months. Tonight, Swift is putting out a movie in theaters called </span><i><span>The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which will include commentary and context for the album from Swift. Maybe that will work in its favor. For now, the music is speaking for itself. For better or worse.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/fEAu5T8XnL">pic.twitter.com/fEAu5T8XnL</a></p> <p>— emily (@grIgenius) <a href="https://twitter.com/grIgenius/status/1973971796795011134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">every year a taylor swift album comes out and she goes roses are red grass is green i love travis and my haters are mean and her fans go Omgggggg the lyricism</p> <p>— zade (@zadtwt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zadtwt/status/1973855618890158350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">she did it omg <a href="https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG">https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG</a> <a href="https://t.co/idYwgDuRH0">pic.twitter.com/idYwgDuRH0</a></p> <p>— Wendell (@RhodeToLove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RhodeToLove/status/1973970282617667816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yall im CRYINGNSIDNDHF <a href="https://t.co/nC25tp2KcZ">pic.twitter.com/nC25tp2KcZ</a></p> <p>— allypally (@allypallyxcx) <a href="https://twitter.com/allypallyxcx/status/1974027869689983175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy">https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy</a> <a href="https://t.co/NAQvUVy9Qp">pic.twitter.com/NAQvUVy9Qp</a></p> <p>— The Coke That Made Charli xcx Brave (@Neil_McNeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_McNeil/status/1974002104575328501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/O23bECsSMr">https://t.co/O23bECsSMr</a> <a href="https://t.co/iK8u3dO19T">pic.twitter.com/iK8u3dO19T</a></p> <p>— keira (@kettlevinyl) <a href="https://twitter.com/kettlevinyl/status/1973991187330576725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">These aren’t lyrics born of depth, just reference points engineered to ride the current wave internet talking points like ‘eldest daughters suffer more than jesus’ and spark a shallow ‘she’s just like me’ emotion from its listener.

                <p>After working in game development for over four decades, Peter Molyneux is calling it quits after he finishes his god game Masters of Albion--that is, if you take his word for it.</p><p>Speaking to Edge (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/emperor-of-overpromising-peter-molyneux-says-hes-done-with-games-after-masters-of-albion-which-is-also-his-redemption-title/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Molyneux called Masters of Albion his "redemption title," adding: "... it's my last game. It just is."

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Masters of Albion Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Masters of Albion is in the works by Molyneux's independent studio, 22cans, which he founded in 2012 after leaving Lionhead Studios. The game, which has players managing a medieval village, currently lacks a release window.</p><p>Molyneux, most famous for designing the god game Black &amp; White and the first three Fable games, is perhaps equally as famous for his pre-release hyperbolic and over-enthusiastic descriptions of his games, often leading to disappointment when they fall short of expectations or lack promised features.</p><p>To his credit, Molyneux is aware of his tendency to exaggerate, telling Edge: "I know people are going to say, 'Come on, it won't be your last game,' but, you know, I'm 66 years old." The veteran developer, who once <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-doesn-t-plan-to-retire-i-m-just-gonna-die/1100-6418258/" data-ref-id="1100-6418258">said in 2014 that he's "just gonna die"</a> instead of retiring, added: "I'm working as hard as I've ever worked in my life. And I just haven't got the life energy left to do this again."</p><p>Even after the public reveal of Masters of Albion, Molyneux expressed the possibility that this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-could-be-his-last-game-due-to-his-smoking-drinking/1100-6526010/" data-ref-id="1100-6526010">next game could be his last</a>, speaking candidly (and rather morbidly) about his lifestyle, which includes smoking and drinking.</p><p>"I started to ask… what should I focus on? I was 60 at the time and this realization came to me that this next game could be my last," Molyneux said in 2024. "I am not announcing I'm retiring. I'll be found dead one morning with my head pressed against the keyboard."</p>

			<p>Skate is out in its early access form, and developer Full Circle and EA are preparing to launch the game's first major content update with the release of Season 1 coming next week on October 7, 2025. A new trailer shows off several of what's to come, like new skate-able areas, new cosmetics for players to earn, the introduction of the Skate Pass, and seasonal events, while <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1">a blog post on the Skate website</a> goes into more detail on everything.</p>



<p>The Skate Pass will introduce daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks that give you various bonuses for completing them, seasonal challenges, and if you purchase the premium version, daily grants for players.</p>



<p>Also included in the Season 1 update will be seasonal events like Skate-O-Ween, the Halloween-themed event Skate will host this month. As EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-early-access-roadmap-ea-full-circle/">previously announced, all of these additions (new areas, cosmetics, seasonal events, etc.)</a> are what you can expect to see in every new season of Skate.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Full Circle and EA's new iteration on the once-beloved skateboarding series has been met with mixed results, to say the least. On the one hand, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/skate-leads-augusts-top-games-by?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=175193486&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Alinea Analytics reports that the game is reaching staggeringly high player numbers</a>, and was one of September's leading games in terms of revenue earned.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the game has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review">critically panned by some</a> and heavily criticized online for being a live-service, microtransaction-forward re-shaping of the series.</p>



<p>Regardless, player numbers and revenue intake all point to this new Skate game having a strong start. The question, of course, is whether it can keep this momentum up, or if the game will drop off and out of the spotlight even before it can exit early access.</p>

              <p>Spooky season is upon us, and that means the movie theater schedules are stacked with horror movies. This year, more than ever, bigger names are being drawn to the genre as it proves one of the most resilient ways of getting butts in seats. With Guillermo del Toro’s <em>Frankenstein</em> leading the pack, we’ve also got Ethan Hawke returning for&nbsp;<em>Black Phone 2</em>, Keira Knightley in&nbsp;<em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>, and both Justin Long and Kate Bosworth appearing in&nbsp;<em>Coyotes</em>. And so many more besides. So, to be helpful, we’ve rounded up the trailers for all of October’s scariest upcoming horror movies.</p> <p>Horror is big business right now, with studios having finally noticed that if you put more than no money into a scary film, you can still make them super-cheap and see some stellar returns. As such, we’re seeing some bigger names wanting to get involved, alongside the gloriously kitsch and classically gory. Below, in order of U.S. release date across October, are our picks for flicks to scare you out of you knicks.</p> <h2><em>Good Boy</em></h2>  <p>Out today (<strong>October 3</strong>) and getting rave reviews (including <a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497">this praise from <em>Kotaku</em>‘s own Kenneth Shepard</a>),&nbsp;<em>Good Boy</em> is a horror movie from the perspective of a dog. Indy the doggo is determined to protect his human buddy Todd from evil forces in a surprisingly short film—just 72 minutes. It’s written and directed by Ben Leonberg, his first feature-length movie, and stars his own pet dog Indy—a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever—in the lead role. The human cast are relative unknowns (although perhaps not for long) Arielle Friedman and Shane Jensen, alongside Hollywood stalwart portrayer of homeless gentlemen, Stuart Rudin.</p> <h2><em>Bone Lake</em></h2>  <p>Has there been a more on-the-nose name for a horror movie since 1999’s ridiculous&nbsp;<em>Cherry Falls</em>?&nbsp;<em>Bone Lake</em> is a sexy horror flick from director Mercedes Bryce Morgan, previously best known for, er,&nbsp;<em>Stargate Origins: Catherine</em>. The Bleecker Street release is clearly attempting to evoke a little bit of&nbsp;<em>Saltburn</em>, but in a story about two couples accidentally booking the same AirBnB for the same weekend. Except, for some reason, everyone keeps taking their clothes off and/or being chopped up by axes and chainsaws. I mean, it sounds like all the elements for a stone-cold B-movie classic. The first handful of reviews have been middling, but then this was never a movie to win over the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. It too is out today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Coyotes</em></h2>  <p>Yet another <strong>October 3</strong> release is comedy horror film <em>Coyotes</em>. Real-life couple Kate Bosworth <em>(Superman</em> <em>Returns</em>, <em>Before I Wake</em>) and Justin Long (<em>Weapons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Quest</em>) reunite after appearing together in 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Barbarian</em>, as parents trapped in their home by a savage pack of…you guessed right, coyotes. It looks tremendously silly, incredibly violent, and contains the line, “GET THE FUCK OFF MY HUSBAND.” That’s all I need. It’s directed by Colin Minihan (<em>What Keeps You Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grave Encounters</em>) and looks like some very schlocky fun.</p> <h2><em>V/H/S Halloween</em></h2>  <p>The infinite arms of the&nbsp;<em>V/H/S</em> franchise reach out yet again, this time with a collection of seven Halloween-themed shorts, one of which comes from director Casper Kelly, the man behind Adult Swim’s&nbsp;<em>Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stroker &amp; Hoop</em>, and the infamous <em>Infomercials</em> episode,&nbsp;<em>Too Many Cooks</em>. It’s on Shudder from today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Scared Shitless</em></h2>  <p>The final <strong>October 3</strong> release (you could watch new horror movies all night tonight!) is&nbsp;<em>Scared Shitless</em>, which looks like it should be hilarious, but the trailer doesn’t have me convinced. It looks like it’s trying a bit too hard with its glove puppet toilet monster and overly wacky goofs. If you recognize the older lead guy, that’s because he’s Steven Ogg, Trevor Phillips from <em>GTA V</em>! His son is played by Daniel Doheny (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) wearing what looks like his first beard, starring alongside the mighty Julian Richings and Mark McKinney. It’s the first theatrically released movie from Canadian comedy director Vivieno Caldinelli, who is more usually shooting skits for sketch shows.</p> <h2><em>Vicious</em></h2>  <p>Paramount Plus gets in on the spooky action <strong>October 10</strong> with Dakota Fanning in&nbsp;<em>Vicious</em>. It seems to set itself up as a film about a woman who is cursed to find three objects, one she loves, one she hates, and one she can’t live without, and put them all in a box before midnight. Should she fail, she’ll die. That’s a great premise, given how hard it would be to look inside yourself and answer those three questions truthfully, but the trailer suggests things are going in about seventy-three other directions too. Clearly Dakota Fanning is a big win for Paramount’s streamer, in a movie written and directed by Bryan “<em>The Strangers”</em> Bertino.</p> <h2><em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em></h2>  <p>On the same day, <strong>October 10</strong>, rival streamer Netflix has its own big-name horror release with <em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>. Kiera Knightley leads, with Guy Pearce (<em>Memento</em>,&nbsp;<em>L.A. Confidential</em>) pulling off a very convincing British accent. It’s all about a reporter on a luxury yacht who thinks she sees a death, and is then hounded and gaslit by the super-posh people on board. Part scary thriller, part whodunnit mystery, it’s directed by Simon Stone, the Swiss director behind 2021’s well-respected&nbsp;<em>The Dig</em>.</p> <h2><em>Black Phone 2</em></h2>  <p>2021’s&nbsp;<em>The Black Phone</em> was an interesting choice for star Ethan Hawke. More usually mumbling through indie roles directed by Richard Linklater, here he jumped into the post-<em>Saw</em> trend for terrifying iconic horror villains: a serial child-killer known as the Grabber. Four years later, Hawke returns to the Blumhouse production for a classic-style sequel, with a should-be-dead enemy returning for revenge against the older cast of the original. Director Scott Derrickson is hit or miss, with a dreadful remake of <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> and some middling horrors like&nbsp;<em>Sinister</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Gorge</em>, but he also gave us the solid <em>Doctor Strange.&nbsp;</em>The trailer looks fantastic, seeming to repeat the Wes Craven meets Stephen King ’70s vibes of the original. It’s out <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Frankenstein</em></h2>  <p>Netflix has funded Guillermo del Toro’s version of&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em>, with a short theatrical release on <strong>October 17</strong> before it arrives on Netflix November 7. (Clearly the streamer thinks there could be trophies in this one.) It’s sticking to the gothic horror of Shelley’s novel, looking like a relatively faithful interpretation, albeit through del Toro’s extraordinary imagination, with Oscar Isaac (<em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Moon Knight</em>) <em>as</em> Dr. Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi (<em>Euphoria</em>) as his creation, alongside Mia Goth (<em>Pearl</em>, <em>Infinity Pool</em>) as Elizabeth. Del Toro doesn’t miss, so there’s every reason to be very excited for this one.</p> <h2><em>R.L. Stine’s Pumpkinhead</em></h2>  <p>I could pretend it wasn’t this trailer that made me want to write this entire article, but I’m not ashamed. 81-year-old Robert Lawrence Stine, the author of the&nbsp;<em>Goosebumps</em> novels, has his name glued to the title of this&nbsp;<em>Pumpkinhead</em> remake (the original starring Lance Henriksen came out in 1988), but he is neither writer nor director. Both those roles fall to Jem Garrard, the director behind last year’s Tubi queer vampire flick <em>Slay</em>. They are back with Tubi for this movie too, a kid-friendly (although not&nbsp;<em>that</em> friendly) film that reimagines the very adult original as something a touch more tame. It’s on Tubi <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</em></h2>  <p>Yup, it’s back. Curtis Hanson’s 1992 classic, starring Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay and Matt McCoy, as well as Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and Madeline Zima, had one of the darkest plots of all time. A sexual predator is caught and kills himself, which causes his widowed wife to miscarry, and in turn drives her to seek revenge on one of his accusers by becoming her nanny and destroying her life. This time, however, the film is less thriller, more horror, given it’s directed by Mexican horror pro Michelle Garza Cervera. And it doesn’t seem to be following the original film’s motives for its characters, either, with nanny Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe of <em>Longlegs </em>and&nbsp;<em>It Follows</em>) hired by upper-class mom Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), who then begins infiltrating her life and marriage. But also, there’s some other weird darkness going on here, something more overtly creepy. It comes to Hulu and Disney+ <strong>October 22</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em></h2>  <p>Arriving on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>,&nbsp;<em>Shelby Oaks</em> looks fucking terrifying. It has the big boost of Mike Flanagan as an executive producer, and is directed by former YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann (<em>Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews</em>). There are some real mixed media vibes to the trailer, in a film about a woman trying to find her missing sister, and beginning to suspect that a demon they imagined in their childhoods might be a bit too real. Camille Sullivan (<em>She Talks to Strangers</em>) is the lead,&nbsp;<em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>‘s Michael Beach is here as a detective, and I’m delighted to say it also stars the always-wonderful Keith David.</p> <h2><em>In Our Blood</em></h2>  <p>“Indie horror” too often means rubbery monsters shot on iPhone, but that’s not the case here.&nbsp;<em>In Our Blood</em> has the vibes of an indie that scoops all the awards at a film festival, but harnessed here to deliver a super-weird and disturbing lo-fi movie about filmmakers making a documentary about reuniting with an estranged mother. However, she’s disappeared, and the reasons why are dark and terrible. It’s directed by Pedro Kos, who has been Oscar nominated for his documentaries, but now turns his hand to narrative. The lead is Brittany O’Grady, one of the stars of the first series of <em>The White Lotus</em>, without any other major names to take away the faux-realism of the flick. It’s in theaters <strong>October 24</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Queens of the</em> <em>Dead</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/george-a-romeros-daughter-zombie-drag-queen-movie-queens-trailer-2000626904">Tina Romero’s <em>Queens of the Dead</em></a> is an attempt to make her own mark following the legacy of her father’s movies. George A. Romero’s&nbsp;<em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and its sequels are certainly memorable, but none of them followed the adventures of a group of drag queens and club kids attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse. Sillier than her dad’s films, <a href="https://www.thecurb.com.au/suff-interview-tina-romero-queens-of-the-dead/">she says</a>,&nbsp;<em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a celebration of queer culture and aims to be uplifting in its politics during a very dark time in real life. Starring Jaquel Spivey (<em>Mean Girls 2024</em>), Katy O’Brian (<em>The Mandolorian</em>,&nbsp;<em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>) and Margaret Cho, it’s getting fantastic early buzz, and will be on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Blood West</em> first launched in Early Access for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on February 10, 2022, followed by a full release on December 5, 2023. “Dead Man’s Promise” was released on December 18, 2024.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Games > Weird West [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> legends meet eldritch horror in <em>Blood West</em>, an immersive stealth first-person shooter. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.</p><p><strong>Three Episodes Offering Over 20 Hours of Play</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.</p><p><strong>Rewarding Classic <a title="Genres > Stealth [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Blood West</em> is a stealth first-person shooter inspired by the genre classics such as the <em>Thief</em> series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> games, or—from the contemporary catalog—<em><a title="Games > Hunt: Showdown [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a></em>. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?</p><p><strong>Weird West Legends Meet Eldritch <a title="Genres > Horror [722 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">Horror</a></strong></p><p>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.</p><p><strong>Unusual Characters and Their <a title="Platforms > Quest [157 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>lines</strong></p><p>In <em>Blood West</em> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.</p><p><strong>Non-Linear Maps Full of Secrets to Find</strong></p><p>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning—it’s probably cursed.</p><p><strong>Brutal Combat Against a Varied Cast of Foes</strong></p><p>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <em>Blood West</em> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <em><a title="Games > POSTAL: Brain Damaged [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/postal-brain-damaged">POSTAL: Brain Damaged</a></em>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!</p><p><strong>Scavenging and Resource <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong></p><p>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that—once slotted—can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.</p><p><strong>Great Variety of Impactful Weapons</strong></p><p>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <em>Blood West</em> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines—a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.</p><p><strong>Perk and Skill-Based Character Progression</strong></p><p>The <a title="Genres > RPG [17,689 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>-like perk-based progression system in <em>Blood West</em> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.</p><p>Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/blood-west-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-on-october-16]]></content:encoded>
