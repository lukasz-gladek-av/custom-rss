		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> update 1.003 is here, bringing with it a new Boss Challenge mode, some new Nano Suits and quality of life improvements to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> exclusive.</p>
<p>Boss Challenge will present you with all 19 bosses from the main game, though you need to have defeated them all in the story mode before you can face them again, and can do so at Hard difficulty after you’ve seen the end of the game.</p>


<p>You can take on the boss rush with either your own gear from the story, or with several presets, from the “minimum” through to a maximum preset with all skills and stats buffed. Then, at the end of a run you’ll see various stats like battle time, perfect parries and dodges, consumables and more.</p>
<p>Defeating all bosses in Boss Challenge will earn you the Neurolink Suit.</p>
<p>Speaking of suits, there’s two colour variants of another new Nano Suit. The White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi, will be available for all in this update.</p>


<p>Rounding out the update are some quality of life improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you switch to ranged attack mode and switch back while locked on to an enemy, you will automatically lock on to the enemy again.</li>
<li>An option to always show the compass in the HUD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stellar Blade is a good, solid action game from Shift Up, blending together high action a la Bayonetta and Nier Automata, and some great PS5 visuals. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/stellar-blade-review/">Stellar Blade review</a>, “Stellar Blade is a pretty enjoyable game to swing your hairband sword at, so long as you don’t mind the obvious sexualisation. There’s a few rough areas, but nothing to spoil things overall and there’s plenty of interesting story to uncover as you fight your way through giant monsters with circular saws for heads and weird tentacles for legs.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/praise-the-emperor-space-marine-2-wont-have-microtransactions.880683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive have confirmed that the upcoming shooter won't feature any kind of microtransactions or cash shop.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4192364930208269562" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the first post of a new Community Update series on Steam</a>, the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is intended to be "an experience tailor-crafted for the players", and so "all gameplay content and features will be free to all players".</p>

<p>There could well be paid DLC for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, but it'll be "cosmetic only", according to the devs, so you won't have to worry about players paying to unlock better weapons or gear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-ultramarine.jpg?itok=ARBx3tzA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-ultramarine.jpg?itok=OBnEtzcI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>won't feature any microtransactions whatsoever.</figcaption></figure><p>The post also provides a rundown for the three main gameplay modes in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, for which we received more details during yesterday's&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>Skulls event.</p>

<p>First up, the campaign will allow you to play as Lieutenant Titus as he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-shows-spectacular-tyranid-carnage-in-extensive-gameplay">slaughters hordes of Tyranid foes</a>. The campaign will also support co-op, with up to two friends being able to join you as additional Ultramarine warriors.</p>

<p>The second mode is Operations, a PvE-focused mode in which you'll play as a custom Space Marine. Six character classes will be available, and you'll work in a team alongside other players to "defeat various xeno abominations".</p>

<p>Finally, Eternal War is a player-versus-player mode that sees the forces of the Imperium doing battle with the legions of Chaos. Each faction will be represented by a team of six in Eternal War matches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-killing-tyranids.jpg?itok=WluLdFrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-microtransactions-killing-tyranids.jpg?itok=yQ1ZDAU9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are gonna be a lot of dead Tyranids by the time you're through with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of the next few months, Focus and Saber will release new info including "many cool and diverse trailers", as well as plenty of screenshots and some short videos showcasing some of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s unique features.</p>

<p>All of this will happen in the lead-up to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003330" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/9n9pczwhvp2l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 9th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>Slovak studio 3Division’s city-building <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic will leave early access on 20th June 2024 – a welcome blast of no-nonsense, planned-economy Soviet realism in the wake of the decadent capitalist theatrics of Summer Games Fest. Here’s a triumphal trailer with many a joyful image of high-density housing and locomotives in the snow.</p>

<p>...and here’s a resplendent bullet-point breakdown of the 1.0 launch from publishers Hooded Horse, who are elsewhere notorious for inflicting feudal village-coddler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> upon the world. You know the old proverb: you can lead a Hooded Horse to communism, but you cannot make it seize the means of production. Yeah, I don’t really know where I’m going with that. It’s dialectics at a standstill, maybe. Perhaps we should allocate more resources to infrastructure, to get dialectics moving again.</p>
<blockquote><p>- New buildings to enrich the lives of citizens through entertainment and fitness, including the amphitheater, and a large stadium.</p>
<p>- Additional playgrounds for the younger generation to stay healthy.</p>
<p>- Brand new Western vehicles to expand the nation’s transit network.</p>
<p>- Revamped education system to maximize the potential reach of teachers.</p>
<p>- Graphical improvements to the electronics components factory, woodcutting post, sawmill, panels factory, and many more key buildings.</p>
<p>- Improved factory connection nodes to facilitate a better flow of resources across complex production chains.</p>
<p>- Plenty of other quality-of-life fixes and HUD tweaks.</p></blockquote>
<p>I only know about Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic thanks to Sin Vega, who has written some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-dont-krai-for-me-in-workers-and-resources">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">glorious</a> things about it and the light it shines on other city-builders. It's been going down well on celebrated socialist platform Steam, and I see no reason why that won't continue once it hits the big 1.0.</p>

			<p>PS5 exclusive <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stellar Blade</a> has dropped its first update since launch, and it serves up a hearty helping of new features, quality-of-life improvements, and fan service. The biggest addition is the new Boss Challenge mode, which developer Shift Up describes thusly…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFstellarblade13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“The Boss Challenge pits you against the 19 bosses from the base game. Hone your skills, outwit your enemies… and then brutalize them. Progression in the Boss Challenge requires battle data from bosses you’ve previously defeated. You can also fight bosses on Hard difficulty setting after you’ve seen the ending of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>You can either load up and use your own gear you’ve been using or choose one of several presets. Choose the minimum preset for a true challenge, which is extremely understated, or the maximum preset, which has all of your skills and stats buffed up, if you want to taunt the boss with some spectacular combat. After the challenge is over, your battle data is automatically analyzed. You’ll see metrics like battle time, number of perfect parries and dodges, consumable usage, and more. Test your skills and compare with your friends.”</em></p>
<p>Those who complete the boss rush, unlock the new Neurolink Suit. Another couple “Kunoichi” Nano Suits have also been added to the game. You can check those out below (the Neurolink Suit is the one with the red pants).</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing – when Stellar Blade launched, some players noticed that, <em>gasp</em>, minor changes had been made to some outfits following the game’s Day 1 patch. Suddenly, those who had been championing Stellar Blade as a return to games as they ought to be were raging about “censorship.” The game’s director stated these changes were just artistic tweaks, not censorship, which seems perfectly believable given the game shipped with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-skin-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Skin Suit”</a> that literally makes the main character Eve look nude. Shift Up clearly isn’t afraid of a little titillation. But regardless, this update also quietly adds another couple outfits that are essentially the original versions of the altered outfits (in fact, they seem to be even a bit <em>more </em>revealing). So, enjoy! But also, maybe leave Shift Up alone now?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFstellarblade12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Meanwhile, here are <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1793675715625533593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some other things included in the update 1.003</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed bugs such as unplayable sections, events not triggering, and trophies not being awarded.</em></li>
<li><em>Added an auto-lock-on option when exiting ranged mode.</em></li>
<li><em>Added option to always show the compass in HUD.</em></li>
<li><em>Slightly increased the time limit for puzzles.</em></li>
<li><em>Many other improvements have been made to the controls, balance, and more.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Stellar Blade can be played on PS5. Update 1.003 should be available to download now.</p>

Since combat and boss fights are the heart of <em>Stellar Blade</em>, the new mode is a great way for players to put to the test the skills they’ve spent the game honing. And things like staying locked on to enemies when switching from long-range weapons to melee attacks are welcome improvements. </p><p>And then there’s the new suits. In addition to the White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi, there’s now Midsummer Redhood and Midsummer Alice outfits available to buy and craft.

Everyone worked so very hard.”</p><p>But not everyone’s ready to give up the fight. “We’ve won nothing!” one player tweeted back. “The original censorship is still there! But they’ve won from your reaction. Know they know that they can bribe us and distract us. Your reaction means we’ve lost!” Others are going over existing costumes with a magnifying glass looking for new signs of “censorship.”</p><p>This includes “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/wapdahca/status/1793998658616410596&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/wapdahca/status/1793998658616410596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency checks</a></span>” on the fabrics that are partially see-through to see if they’ve been made more opaque.

Like most conspiracists, they’re probably unlikely to ever be satisfied, instead destined to spend the rest of their days searching for truth in the pixels of a sci-fi lace teddy. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In this article, I’d like to tell you a bit about our collaborative, community-driven approach to the development of our flagship franchise, Dying Light. I want to convey why this attitude is so important for us and why we think it’s the right way to go when it comes to our games. I’ll also spotlight the Community Ideas initiative, which is a perfect encapsulation of this strategy.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first Dying Light game was released back in 2015 as our second venture into the realm of open-world zombie IPs. We were very proud of its uniqueness—the core elements, such as the first-person perspective parkour, focus on melee weapons, and the day/night cycle that heavily influenced the gameplay, made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really stand apart. The appreciation we got from the players back then and the community that started to form around the game gave us—the developers—a lot of confidence and let us spread our wings. Since then, we adopted the strategy of giving back to our players, we’re listening to their suggestions and feedback. We ended up supporting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for almost seven years after its release, building a massive community—the game currently has an overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam with 300,000 reviews, more appearing each day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we released the sequel in 2022, we knew from the very beginning that we wanted to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a good couple of years. We wanted the fans to have a say in how the world is shaped, to have their opinions taken into consideration when it comes to decisions regarding the direction of the brand itself and design decisions, both big and small.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We focused on the three main areas of cooperation with the community:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social Media communication</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s start with the basics. Like every studio, we try to monitor the opinions of our players that they share online. Our Community Management Team reads and analyzes the feedback and investigates the player sentiment as well as the reception of updates and features that we regularly add to the game. Additionally, said team, together with our QA department, turns the players’ requests into tangible project tasks, recording them in Jira once a week, which are then properly groomed by producers and have their priorities assigned. This helps us work on the requests from our community on an ongoing basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community Council is a group of several dozen of the most dedicated, trusted players, community members and influencers with whom we meet once per quarter to talk about our plans for the evolution of the game and get their feedback. Those are the same people we invite to participate in the closed beta tests of the new in-game initiatives. Some of the features that benefited from this treatment—such as the addition of a physical parkour setting or the newly released Nightmare Difficulty—were broadly appreciated by the community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, however, I’d like to focus on what is, in our opinion, the most interesting endeavor we’ve attempted yet: the Community Ideas program. It’s a special means of getting feedback, where our players can submit requested features and elements they’d like to see added to our game. The ideas that are feasible to implement, based on the existing gameplay mechanics, can be found on the dedicated page of our community hub,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/goodies/community-ideas?state=1&amp;category=&amp;order=&amp;page=1&amp;limit=20&amp;query="> Pilgrim Outpost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Then, the players vote for their favorites to be included in the game. But don’t let this cursory outline fool you! The entire matter is quite complex, with a pretty extensive process that involves us checking each submitted idea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The voting happens in stages and it’s important to note here that this timing is aligned with our release cycle, as we aim to update the game once every few months. Thanks to this scheduling, the ideas can be implemented fairly soon.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, several of the most popular ideas end up with the development team, where they’re further assessed. While evaluating them, we pay attention to their originality, feasibility, added value, whether a given feature would clash with other gameplay elements from a technical perspective, and so on. The ideas are divided into three categories:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The accepted ones land in our task lists, where we calculate what is needed to implement them and what’s the rough timeline for that. The rejected ideas are deemed unsuitable or ultimately too costly. It’s also worth mentioning that we not only notify the authors of the rejected ideas that we’re not moving forward with them, but we also try to give them the reason for the refusal whenever we can. It’s additional work, of course, but we don’t want to discourage our players by the lack of feedback from us. The third option is Backlog—it’s for the ideas that we like and want to take a closer look at, but their implementation is not immediately possible. It might come down to the insufficient amount of time and resources at a particular moment, or the fact that they would involve altering the game in a significant way—but we still like them and want them to happen at a later date. They’re benched for now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We launched the second round of Community Ideas in mid-April, which means that the players can again submit their ideas and vote for the best ones. We received over 1500 new entries in a couple of days, so the interest has not waned. We also keep getting feedback concerning the process itself. At the community’s request, we implemented features such as a keyword search bar, extended categories filter, multiple language support, and entry translation powered by Google API. And we will keep upgrading the tool.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We consider this collaborative, community-driven approach to supporting our games to be a good strategy—as every developer cares about favorable reception as well as high community engagement. I think I can confidently claim that our method works. Since the introduction of the Community Ideas program, the player sentiment, expressed as positive comments and reviews, has risen. And </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—despite the fact that it’s an open-world AAA game—can still boast a sizable player base two years after it premiered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Undoubtedly, this type of approach comes with a multitude of challenges. The most substantial one is finding balance between applying the suggestions from the community and maintaining your own authorial vision of the game. The other obstacle is finding time and appropriate resources to be able to focus on implementing the community's ideas, yes, but first and foremost, on realizing our development plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical side alone—Pilgrim Outpost website maintenance, accumulating and cleaning up of the ideas themselves, not to mention managing the duplicates—is incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Regardless of whether you decide to launch a dedicated program, like our Community Ideas, or to follow a general strategy of community-driven development, you need to:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prepare a production pipeline that will be able to take on the incoming community requests;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure that you have appropriate resources at your disposal: people, time, money—all according to the model you’re working with;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interact with the players—launching such a program or a development strategy is a huge commitment on the part of the developer, so you need to be transparent in your actions and communicate the respective stages, decisions, etc.;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be consistent in your actions—nowadays, it’s extremely easy to lose the players’ trust and end up with a result that is entirely opposite to what you had in mind, so if you show your community that they are important, stick to it;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brace yourself for tough feedback.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This all may seem a bit daunting—and that’s a reasonable reaction. The entire process is a lot, but with good planning, cleverly allocated resources, and some flexibility, it’s entirely feasible. And the benefits are really worth it. On the one hand, you get a structured and regulated source of player feedback, and on the other, you give the community the means to influence the game’s development. Both sides benefit, and the game itself ends up getting better and better!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="176" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hooded Horse and 3Division <a href="https://youtu.be/gswXkLcAFxA?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have announced</a> that the ridiculously intricate city builder, <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em>, will be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-is-planning-to-exit-early-access-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving Early Access</a> on June 20, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">I’ve played a lot of city builders in my time, and <em>Workers &amp; Resources</em> is easily the most complicated. Not only do you need to build homes for your citizens and workplaces and industry to employ them, you also need to make sure that your supply and production chain is working as efficiently as possible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true">Supply chains are hardly anything new, but usually, there’s some abstract automation there. As long as you have your roads connected, normally, your products get where they need to go. For example, you might need to connect your factory to a cargo train. And then you need to ensure that the train is able to get where it needs to go without bumping into other trains. Then, on top of that, you need to connect its destination to the train so that whatever was produced gets to the next step in its journey.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">It takes a lot of trial and error to figure out how things work. A recent update added a “campaign,” which largely acts as an extended tutorial. Even with that, I kept making costly mistakes. This feels like the sort of game where it’s going to take a few attempts before you really understand enough to be successful.</p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic - 1.0 Release Date Trailer | City Builder Tycoon Game" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gswXkLcAFxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">That said, the genre really needs something that really pushes the complexity. I love city builders that gloss over certain aspects in the effort to keep things accessible, but you need some place to go when you really want something to sink your teeth into.</p> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">The 1.0 release will include a number of upgrades to the current version. Here’s the bulleted list from the press release:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"> <li>New buildings to enrich the lives of citizens through entertainment and fitness, including the amphitheater, and a large stadium.</li> <li>Additional playgrounds for the younger generation to stay healthy.</li> <li>Brand new Western vehicles to expand the nation’s transit network.</li> <li>Revamped education system to maximize the potential reach of teachers.</li> <li>Graphical improvements to the electronics components factory, woodcutting post, sawmill, panels factory, and many more key buildings.</li> <li>Improved factory connection nodes to facilitate a better flow of resources across complex production chains.</li> <li>Plenty of other quality-of-life fixes and HUD tweaks.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Sounds awesome. I really need to take another crack at <em>Workers &amp; Resources</em>. I was starting to get all its systems organized in my head before something else got my attention. Something catastrophic, no doubt. The 1.0 release sounds like the absolute best time to try again.</p> <p data-characters="85" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false"><em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em> leaves Early Access for PC on June 20, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following community feedback, <em>The Sims 4</em> has established a dedicated team to work on issues raised by players via the Answer HQ feedback form. Ahead of the next update, which doesn’t have a release date yet, The Sims team issued a ‘<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laundry list</a>’ of things they aim to fix.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">There are quite a few bugs and minor issues that have been reported via the <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-4/ct-p/the-sims-4-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Answer HQ </a>form, and the team hopes to fix them over the next six months. The goal is that with the creation of this focused team, updates will go out faster, and more fixes will be implemented in each update.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Although this is the first ‘laundry list’ that has been released, <em>The Sims 4</em> hopes to issue a new laundry list roughly every two months, detailing the items they’re currently working on and aiming to fix.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rabbit and Bear has released a new&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and it reveals the release months for the JRPG's three additional character-focused DLC chapters.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Eiyuden_JP/status/1793892378740469856" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account, Rabbit and Bear highlights the DLC that's already available, including the Pioneer Pack, the HQ Makeover Package, and the special Nowa Haniwa HQ statue.</p>

<p>More importantly, however, the roadmap reveals that&nbsp;the game's three extra DLC chapters, which will revolve around Marisa, Seign, and Markus respectively, will launch in successive months later this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap-proper.jpg?itok=Oe1VBmSn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-roadmap-proper.jpg?itok=N_pKeIEN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The roadmap is in Japanese, but the release months for each DLC pack are pretty clear: Marisa's chapter is slated for August, with Seign's landing in September and Markus' coming in October.</p>

<p>Since this is the Japanese roadmap, and it hasn't been released on any of the official English&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em>social media channels, it's possible these are Japanese-only release windows.</p>

<p>However, given that the&nbsp;<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694110/Eiyuden_Chronicle_Hundred_Heroes__Season_Pass?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Season Pass page on Steam</a> lists a Q4 release date for all of these packs, the Western release dates aren't likely to be far behind, even if they are different.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the three additional DLC episodes will be free to Kickstarter backers, but if you didn't back the game and you still want to play them, you'll be able to buy each episode separately or all three as part of the Season Pass.</p>

<p>Created by many of the folks behind the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, including director Yoshitaka Murayama (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-and-eiyuden-chronicle-creator-yoshitaka-murayama-has-passed-away">sadly passed away earlier this year</a>), the RPG boasts many similar features to its inspiration, including a host of heroes to recruit, minigames to play, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/22339948/mario-games-ranked-switch-super-nintendo-64-luigi-yoshi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="a0B2A3">There have never been more Mario games available on a single console than on Nintendo Switch. There are brand-new entries in the core 2D and 3D series; numerous spinoffs, sports, and party games; a few remakes, including the freshly released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>; the best-selling Mario game ever, in the shape of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>; plus a roster of classic titles on Nintendo Switch Online as it has expanded to include NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance titles — including among them what are indubitably some of the greatest video games ever made.</p>
<p id="RHG30T">By our count, there are no less than 46 individual Mario games available on Switch. (In fact, there are more than that, but we’ll get to that in a second.) By “Mario games,” we mean games in which Mario is the main character, or that feature his name in the title (sorry, Luigi). To help you sort through this morass of Mario content, we decided to rank them all. </p>
<p id="Fw6cyk">To make sense of this gargantuan task, we decided to try something new and rank the games in a tier list — S-tier, A-tier, B-tier, and so on — rather than use a numerical ranking. This is a clearer way to present such a long list, and also avoids a lot of arbitrary decisions when comparing games in such a wide range of genres: platformers, RPGs, puzzle games, racing games, sports games, and more. Unlike our numerical rankings, we’ll start with the best, S-tier games at the top, and work our way down. The games are listed in no particular order within each tier.</p>
<p id="ayURZk">Similarly, to keep things simple and avoid duplication, we ruled out a few games. The Super Mario Advance titles, a series of remakes for Game Boy Advance now available on Nintendo Switch Online, are out, because the original versions are all also playable on Switch. (The Advance versions are good, though, and we’ve made a note under the original entries when one is available.) The same goes for the SNES remake compilation <em>Super Mario All-Stars</em>, which collects the NES-era Super Mario Bros. titles; it’s also a great way to play these games.</p>
<p id="I6JQh7">It was a more tricky decision to decide to exclude <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/16/21431109/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-mario-64-galaxy-sunshine-resolution-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em></a>, a limited-edition collection for Mario’s 35th anniversary, which is the only way to play <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> and <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>on Switch. (It also includes <em>Super Mario 64</em>.) The collection leaves something to be desired (not least for omitting the amazing <em>Galaxy 2</em>), and Nintendo’s baffling decision to limit its run has made it difficult to acquire now without spending a fortune on the used market, so we left it out. Hopefully Nintendo will find a better way to honor these classic games in the future. But for now — let’s rank!</p>
<p id="01cPj2"><strong>Update (May 23, 2024):</strong> This article has been updated to add <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> and <em>Super Mario Land</em>.</p>

<p id="Al2rx7">An expression of pure creativity, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23920680/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> takes the 2D platforming strain of Super Mario games in delightful, constantly surprising directions. Exploring the all-new Flower Kingdom, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, and friends embark on a quest to take down Bowser — who has become a menacing flying castle! <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> famously introduces all-new power-ups, including the ability for our heroes to become elephants and a reality-altering upgrade called the Wonder Flower. That new flower is the source of <em>Wonder</em>’s many surprises, turning classic Mario mechanics upside down and treating each level as if it were a theme park ride. Expect the unexpected.</p>
<p id="sFQc8G"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> is cleverly designed with cooperative play in mind, with concessions for younger players. It can be played solo for a challenge, with a friend collaboratively, online for a sense of community, or as the guide for anyone new to Mario games — you can literally carry your friends and loved ones on your back as Yoshi, in one of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>’s many smart ideas. —<em>Michael McWhertor</em></p>

<p id="RPfVrz">60 million <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/mario-kart-8/8635"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a> fans can’t be wrong. The Switch’s best-selling game is big for a reason: This is the ultimate Mario Kart package, with dozens of racers and courses, and finely honed classic karting action. Bolstered by the Booster Course Pass downloadable content, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> spoils players with choice.</p>
<p id="Cwjaer">Accept no imitators. Nintendo has been the king of console kart-racing games since 1992, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is so jam-packed with content and expertly polished gameplay that it’s almost impossible to predict where the franchise could go from here. —<em>MM</em></p>

<p id="hUDtK2">When it came time to update its world-conquering Super Mario Bros. series for the launch of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo chose smoothness, finesse, and design sophistication over a huge leap in graphical quality or a ton of new features. The result is a game that has aged far better than it might have, and arguably better than many Mario games that came before <em>and</em> after it.</p>
<p id="qbAJoc"><em>Super Mario World </em>is gorgeous, effortlessly legible, and delightfully chaotic and surprising. It ties everything that made <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> great into a more rounded and coherent package, and also gave us Yoshi. Is it the greatest 2D platformer of all time? Probably — and its closest competition is also on this list. <em>—Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="YGHux2"><em>Super Mario 64 </em>brought a new dimension to Mario games, literally. Originally released on the Nintendo 64, the game showcased the capabilities of Nintendo’s console and allowed Mario to jump, skip, and fly in fully 3D-generated worlds, breaking free from his humble 2D origins. From the explosive speckled green fields of Bob-omb Battlefield to the squawking penguin babies of Cool, Cool Mountain, Nintendo managed to convey a sense of wonder and surprise, all nestled into the regal halls of Princess Peach’s castle.</p>
<p id="tEtulb">Since its initial release in 1996, the game has been ported to several Nintendo consoles and has become a touchstone of the Mario franchise. The platforming might not feel as polished when compared to modern Mario games, but it still has aged well, and it remains a popular choice for competitive speedrunners and casual players alike. <em>Super Mario 64 </em>is massively influential, not just for Mario but on video games more widely — and for that, it earns a top spot on this list. <em>—Ana Diaz</em></p>

<p id="JbKdXM">In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/26/16551724/super-mario-odyssey-review"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, the Switch’s main entry in the 3D Mario platforming canon, Mario can transform into various creatures and inanimate objects with a quick flick of his hat. By introducing this gimmick, Nintendo turns each of the game’s worlds into a veritable playground for Mario; our dear plumber can become a frog, or fling himself by transforming into a street delineator. Pair this with some of my favorite visuals in a Mario game ever, and you have the makings of a great game.</p>
<p id="8G7BG4"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> has a lot to love, but I’ll remember it as a game that really innovated on the standard 3D Mario formula. Instead of having set levels with specific missions or tasks, <em>Odyssey </em>just plops Mario into each world with no particular guidance. The developers created worlds that invite curiosity, as players freely explore and discover its collectible Power Moons. It brings an open-world feel to the game that largely works, and kept me interested in discovering all its delights and surprises. Last but not least, <em>Odyssey</em> showed us shirtless Mario <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/14/16306968/shirtless-mario-nipples-super-mario-odyssey">and his nipples</a>, so I have to give points for that.<em> —AD</em></p>

<p id="qCoeZ4"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/sub-gems/23627548/super-mario-bros-3-nintendo-switch-classic"><em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em></a> is the perfect mixture of innovation and execution of Mario’s core attributes. This was the <em>actual</em> sequel to the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, after <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> bifurcated into different versions in Japan and the West, both with their own compromises. If you were hoping for more of that unalloyed Nintendo magic, here it was: You could fly, you could turn into a statue, and there were secrets galore. The game’s release was a gigantic cultural event, complete with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2zps0pzrxk">one of the most memorable video game commercials ever created</a>. And it’s still a stone-cold classic now. <em>—Ben Kuchera</em></p>

<p id="zkkjRZ">Leave it to Nintendo to make an escort mission actually enjoyable, as Yoshi takes center stage as the hero in this Mario game — and Mario himself is turned into a baby who must be kept safe. (Its inclusion in this list is something of a technicality — while it’s technically a sequel to <em>Super Mario World</em>, <em>Yoshi’s Island</em> can also be seen as the start of Yoshi’s own series.)</p>
<p id="L6hNAd">It’s also one of the best-crafted platformers of all time, and one of the funniest. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sub-gems/23283668/yoshis-island-super-mario-world-2-nintendo-switch-online-sub-gems"><em>Yoshi’s Island</em></a> looks like it was drawn and colored by hand, and the whimsical tone hides how every aspect of the game seems to have been fussed over and perfected. This was a huge departure for the Mario franchise at the time, but it’s only gotten better with age. <em>—BK</em></p>

<p id="66b1av">After 20 years, Nintendo has finally chosen to reissue what many fans consider the best Mario role-playing game — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch">in a handsome new remaster</a>, too. <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is perhaps the oddest and most irreverent game ever to star the little mustachioed plumber, certainly in story terms. If it’s not the funniest, that’s only because it shares that honor with its close cousin, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em>.</p>
<p id="Wh1cXF">You’ll find more inventive gameplay elsewhere in this list — <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> is mostly a solid evolution of the my-first-RPG mechanics of <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and the first <em>Paper Mario</em>. But the level invention and boundary-pushing poured into the game’s cast of bizarre, horny, obnoxious, and gloriously silly characters, stories, asides, and gags is second to none. It’s an absolute joy. <em>—OW</em></p>

<p id="J8QPDG">Building on ideas from the also-great <em>Super Mario 3D Land </em>for 3DS, <em>3D World</em> is a wonderful exploration of three decades’ worth of Mario mechanics, power-ups, and enemies, all delightfully remixed in a gorgeous, lengthy adventure. <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> is also where players were introduced to the clever puzzles of Captain Toad and the admittedly weird concept of Cat Mario.</p>
<p id="vVIBc6">Originally stuck on the Wii U, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22273180/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a> was given new life on Switch, giving Nintendo fans another chance to experience this celebration of 3D Mario. Paired with the lovely <em>Bowser’s Fury —</em> an experimental, slightly open-world take on the 3D Mario formula — it’s an amazing package.</p>
<p id="GEqvbv"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em> suffers only slightly from its focus on co-op play, which supports up to four players, but can make navigating its diverse worlds challenging at times. <em>—MM</em></p>

<p id="xGZA2q"><em>Super Mario Maker </em>unleashed a digital toolbox that shaped the culture of how Mario is played as we know it. And the sequel built upon that foundation.</p>
<p id="2g0iHd">As its name suggests, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/6/26/18758748/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em></a> allows players to design and share their own 2D Mario levels. (The game does have a single-player campaign, but the design elements are the main draw.) </p>
<p id="rW3smU">Players of <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> took its creative elements and ran with them. Whereas some leaned into the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/2019/7/4/20681188/best-super-mario-maker-2-levels-top-10">creative elements</a> and pulled off feats like recreating popular songs inside levels of the game, others took to designing super-difficult challenges for Kaizo Mario players. </p>
<p id="C4oGz9">Custom levels allowed fans to produce some of the toughest Mario levels yet, and put the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/streaming/2021/2/11/22264967/grandpoobear-super-mario-maker-2-levels-youtube-twitch-streamer">best Mario players in the world to the test</a>. Nintendo showed just how much players can do with the freedom to imagine their own levels. —<em>AD</em></p>

<p id="WDnoua"><em>Super Mario Kart</em> is the first game in the Mario Kart series — the success that likely inspired just about every game company on the planet to put its characters in karts at least once in the past 30 years, and one of the first games to show what Mario could bring to genres far outside of his platforming origins. </p>
<p id="22Igg1"><em>Super Mario Kart</em> also showed off the 3D capabilities of the Super Nintendo by using its Mode 7 technology, which kept the characters in the middle of the screen and moved the world around them to simulate movement. None of this would have mattered if the game hadn’t been a blast, though, and Mario Kart came out of the gate with confidence and plenty of the most important aspects of the series already in place. Even today, it’s a really tight, well-tuned, and satisfying racing game to play. Some characters only change the face of gaming once, but Mario has done so for more genres than I can count. <em>—BK</em></p>

<p id="tSoCB5">There’s no doubt that the original 1985 <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>for NES is one of the most important, influential, and brilliantly designed games of all time. There’s even an argument that Shigeru Miyamoto’s classic is the game responsible, more than any other, for firing the video game industry back to life after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983">the crash of 1983</a>. It expanded Mario’s world from one screen to a scrolling infinity. It’s a cornerstone of the console gaming industry, and perhaps the first game that opened a space between arcade gaming and computer gaming for games that could be simple and accessible, but deep and sophisticated at the same time.</p>
<p id="zlK7aq">So why’s it only in our A tier? Simply put, it’s just not as fun to play now as <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and <em>Super Mario World</em> — games that took its revolutionary ideas and refined and expanded them to a point of perfection. <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>is a hall-of-famer and essential for students of the medium, but for pure fun value, play its successors first. <em>—OW</em></p>

<p id="YSKEmg">The third Super Mario role-playing game, following <em>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</em> and <em>Paper Mario</em>, is one of Nintendo’s strongest. Boasting expert comedy writing and a clever combat system, <em>Superstar Saga</em> kicked off a brand-new subseries of Mario games in 2003, thanks to its memorable mechanics and hilarious antagonists Cackletta and Fawful.</p>
<p id="079HZa"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em> sends the plumber bros on a mission to a new land, the Beanbean Kingdom, in search of Princess Peach’s stolen voice — as fresh a spin Nintendo had at the time on the kidnapping trope that Peach has been subjected to for decades. More inventive than another rescue-mission story are the game’s mechanics, which build on previous Mario RPGs’ timing-based, turn-based battles with weapons, super powers, and cooperative special moves.</p>
<p id="kTWpQJ">But it’s the writing of Cackletta, Fawful, and supporting characters that makes <em>Superstar Saga</em> so wonderful. Paired with lovely sprite work and music from composer Yoko Shimomura, the first Mario &amp; Luigi game is (still) a must-play. <em>—MM</em></p>

<p id="pdxPpf">Although Mario Kart’s template was brilliantly laid out in the first SNES game, this N64 sequel made a few crucial changes that have left a lasting mark on the series. The first was four-player split-screen. The second was a change in the philosophy of the course design, from tight, technical circuits to more open tracks littered with hazards, secrets, and moments of spectacle. The third was embodied in the infamous blue shell, a homing weapon guaranteed to take out the leader, awarded to a player far back in the pack.</p>
<p id="K26Vwe">Thus the spirit of Mario Kart was born: fair, but only in the most unfair way; controlled, beautiful chaos for as many people as you can fit around your TV. It’s still a blast to this day. <em>—OW</em></p>

<p id="WIgIEB">These days, there is only one Mario Party game I load up when the inevitable social gathering calls for it:<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22749509/mario-party-superstars-review-switch-nintendo-64-boards-mini-games"><em>Mario Party Superstars</em></a>. </p>
<p id="7kIC7q">It’s not the best Mario Party game because it’s the most recent or has flashy new features; it’s the best because the entire game is actually a callback to previous Mario Party games. <em>Superstars </em>pulls every minigame and board from a previous series entry, so it’s basically a hall of fame for Mario Party games. </p>
<p id="1yKFfP">For me, it’s my go-to Mario Party game because its basic retro controls and mechanics make it an easy game for a wide range of abilities to play; anyone from my <em>Overwatch</em>-obsessed esports cousin to the 4-year-old who prefers to play games on an iPad can enjoy it. Retro Mario Party games found new life through <em>Mario Party Superstars</em>, and these days it’s the only Mario Party you really need. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="LDI4I4">Originally not a Mario game but a reskin of a completely different game released only in Japan, <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> is sometimes considered a strange deviation and not a “true” Mario game — in part because the ending implies it was all a dream. But Nintendo’s sort-of sequel to the classic <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is now a core part of Mario lore. It introduced Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters and brought a host of new creatures and enemies to the Mushroom Kingdom. If it weren’t for <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>’s strange path to becoming a Mario sequel, would we have Shy Guys, Birdo, and Bob-ombs in modern Mario games? Maybe not!</p>
<p id="qLrs7T"><em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> may be a weird retrofit aimed at Western audiences, but its gameplay mechanics had an enduring impact on the franchise. And it’s got some of the catchiest music of any Mario game, thanks to composer Koji Kondo’s ragtime-inspired soundtrack. <em>—MM</em></p>

<p id="gjjDhq"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23960636/super-mario-rpg-2023-switch-remake-review"><em>Super Mario RPG</em></a> is an original role-playing Mario adventure given a long-awaited and fairly lavish Switch remake treatment. It’s an odd bird, this — it was made by Square at the height of Final Fantasy’s popularity, and despite the characters feels as much like a Square game as a Nintendo one. It’s clunky in places, but very charming, and it established the streamlined, rhythmic “my first RPG” formula that Nintendo went on to use in Paper Mario and Mario &amp; Luigi games. The remake makes some wise improvements but is very respectful to the slightly wonky, funhouse-mirror look and feel of the original. <em>—OW</em> </p>

<p id="DsF5dH">The game that started the Mario franchise, <em>Donkey Kong</em> is still a highly replayable arcade game full of challenge. The version available on Nintendo Switch Online, available as part of the Nintendo Entertainment System collection, is not the best version of <em>Donkey Kong</em>, sadly. It’s the meager NES port, which does not feature the arcade version’s cutscenes and only features three playable levels — the fourth, the cement factory level, isn’t present.</p>
<p id="tdF4Vn">For the full experience, you’ll need to shell out separately for <em>Arcade Archives: Donkey Kong</em>, a faithful, stand-alone port of the original arcade game. Either way, the retro sights and sounds of <em>Donkey Kong</em> are worth returning to for a dose of classic Nintendo nostalgia. Keep your fingers crossed for an eventual release of the Game Boy version of <em>Donkey Kong</em> from 1994, which takes the original game in creative new directions. <em>—MM</em></p>

<p id="JeCNNK">Although Game Boy <em>Donkey Kong</em> remains the greatest Mario platformer to grace Nintendo’s original handheld hardware — sadly unavailable on Switch at the moment — <em>Super Mario Land 2</em> is no slouch. Leaping forward from the original’s imitation of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> to take in the innovations of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em> and <em>Super Mario World</em>, it’s an amazing feat of miniaturization for its time, and still a lot of fun to play. Also, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/wario/22698796/wario-game-list-history-retrospective">this is the game that gave the world Wario</a> — he’s the antagonist, and Mario’s quest is to go bop him on the head. For that alone, <em>Super Mario Land 2</em>’s place in culture is assured. <em>—OW</em></p>

<p id="hGmSrO"><em>Paper Mario</em> is one of the most original and beguiling visual treatments Mario’s world — it’s up there with the delightful crayon scribbles of <em>Yoshi’s Island</em>. Very cute paper cutouts of Mario and all his pals scamper around 3D dioramas made of simple but richly textured geometry; it’s just gorgeous stuff.</p>
<p id="1lNPuV">Gameplay-wise, this is another evolution of the simple, approachable Mario RPG framework, with rhythmic battle inputs to keep you involved. Its storybook approach is more wistful and less uproarious than the out-and-out comedy of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em>, though. This first Paper Mario is still wonderfully pretty, but if you want to play the best game in the series, wait for the upcoming Switch remake of the GameCube classic <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. <em>—OW</em></p>

<h3 id="Cg9Qii"><strong>Super Mario Land</strong></h3>
<p id="ygOv9V"><em>Super Mario Land</em> was a hugely significant game when it came out in 1989 for the Game Boy — a kind of proof-of-concept that a handheld console could deliver something very close to the home console experiences players were used to. And it’s definitely a 2D Mario platformer as we know and love them. It might be the shallowest and weakest of the whole bunch though, and was comprehensively eclipsed by its sequel. <em>—OW</em></p>

This game was not only the debut for Mario’s sibling, Luigi; it also established the two as plumbing professionals, and made turtlelike beings their mortal enemies for the next four decades. <em>—Owen S.

<h3 id="fGD5kd"><strong>Mario’s Super Picross</strong></h3>
<p id="22jdNY">This Switch Online edition of <em>Mario’s Super Picross</em> is the first time the game has been made available in the U.S. If you haven’t played any games in the series, imagine a mixture of sudoku and maybe <em>Minesweeper</em>, in which you’re trying to reveal a Mario-themed image hidden in each puzzle. It’s fine. (And there are far better Picross games on Switch.) <em>—BK</em></p>

<h3 id="c7rbAD"><strong>Arcade Archives Vs. Super Mario Bros., Wrecking Crew, and Wrecking Crew ’98</strong></h3>
<p id="V0Z93Y">The <em>Vs. </em>arcade version of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is much harder, more mean-spirited, and more frustrating in ways that aren’t fun. I’m glad you can buy it and play it, because it’s a part of Mario history, but if you’re not a historian, you can safely avoid this whole mess. <em>Wrecking Crew</em>, available in either arcade or NES form, is a completely different game in which Mario and Luigi are demolition experts and have to take down buildings. Both games are mere curiosities. <em>—BK</em></p>
<p id="fZZ9cp">The same is true of <em>Wrecking Crew ’98</em>, although it’s probably more deserving of your time than the original. This SNES sequel takes the form of a competitive puzzle game with more strategy to its demolition gameplay, and it’s never seen a release in the West before. Still nothing more than a curio, though. <em>—OW</em></p>
<p id="Wte3Pq"><small><em>Wrecking Crew</em></small><small> is included in Nintendo Switch Online’s NES collection, or in an Arcade Archives edition. </small><small><em>Wrecking Crew </em></small>’<small><em>98</em></small><small> is included in Nintendo Switch Online’s SNES collection.</small></p>

Chances are that this posting could be for a design director to help out on future installments in either of those series that Respawn is already balancing between three huge internal studios. But unlike many others, I don’t believe anything is <em>truly</em> dead, and certainly not <em>Titanfall</em>. As EA and Respawn consider future moves, especially as the live-service bubble continues to burst, I pray they make the call we’ve all been waiting for. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/4IhHSi1KgvXFeiFHIEZMga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft has released</a> the first patch update for it’s free-to-play shooter XDefiant. The patch is being billed as “Preseason Patch 1”, and tackles just a few issues within the game since its launch on May 21.</p>



<p>A couple of the updates include Netcode improvements and spawning issues in the Practice Zone. You can see the full patch notes below.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-xdefiant-patch-1-notes">Full XDefiant Patch 1 Notes</h2>



<h3>Game Modes&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Sometimes players loading into the Practice Zone would spawn outside the world, in a hellscape, and now they (probably) will not.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>Devices&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where if the player died during the device deployment animation, their next deployed device would drop at their feet rather than be thrown as intended.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>Netcode&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>That issue where you’d get hitmarkers on an enemy as they killed you, but their health bar still appeared full to you? The health bar display was wrong – you did damage them. Should be fixed now.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>Localization&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where end-of-match UI text would display with the wrong orientation in Arabic.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>Miscellaneous&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>We’ve turned the Practice Zone back on but it’s possible weird things could still happen.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that was causing low framerates with some AMD GPUs.</li>
</ul>

<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Alhaitham is a powerful DPS character in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, but is he worth pulling for your account? Here’s a breakdown of Alhaitham’s pros and cons, as well as a dive into his Constellations and weapon value.</p> <h2 id="h-how-good-is-alhaitham-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">How good is Alhaitham in Genshin Impact?</h2> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">In terms of raw strength, <strong>Alhaitham is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-character-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the strongest characters in <em>Genshin Impact</em></a></strong>. If you are looking for an on-field Dendro DPS unit, or just a strong character to carry your team through the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-teams-and-strategies-for-spiral-abyss-floor-12-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiral Abyss</a>, Alhaitham will serve you well.</p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">That said, no one is a must-pull in <em>Genshin Impact.</em> Alhaitham may be capable of great damage, but there are plenty of other damage dealers you can choose from. Even if they’re not <em>as</em> strong as Alhaitham, most of them are still capable of taking on the hardest content in <em>Genshin Impact.</em></p>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Whether you should pull for Alhaitham depends on what other characters you have. If you already have several on-field DPS characters, your teams may benefit more from an off-field character of some sort. If you don’t like using Electro characters, then you might not like Alhaitham’s best teams.</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">You should also try out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-alhaitham-in-genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alhaitham’s combos</a> during his character trial. His playstyle can be a bit technical, and there’s little room for error when executing his best combos. You may need to practice a bit, but you’ll be rewarded with very quick clears of difficult content.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-are-alhaitham-constellations-worth-it" data-injectable="false">Are Alhaitham Constellations worth it?</h2> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, Alhaitham is already strong at Constellation 0.</strong> His Constellations offer various buffs for himself and his team, but they’re a mixed bag when it comes to being worth it. If you do spring for Alhaitham’s Constellations, I recommend stopping at Constellation 2.</p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">Alhaitham’s Constellation 1 doesn’t impact his gameplay very much. It can give you some flexibility in case your combo is interrupted, but in most scenarios, you won’t see its effects.</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">Constellation 2 gives Alhaitham an Elemental Mastery buff when he generates a Chisel-Light Mirror. Since his kit revolves around generating mirrors, this Constellation is a decent increase to his damage output.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">Constellation 3 adds three Talent levels to Alhaitham’s Skill. While his Skill is a large source of Alhaitham’s damage, Talent levels aren’t as impactful as they are for other characters. Constellation 3 ends up being a smaller boost than Constellation 2.</p> <h2 id="h-is-alhaitham-s-weapon-worth-it" data-injectable="false">Is Alhaitham’s weapon worth it?</h2> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Alhaitham’s signature weapon, <strong>Light of Folar Incision, is generally not worth pulling for.</strong> There are several other 5-star Swords that perform similarly, including Primordial Jade Cutter, Uraku Misugiri, Mistsplitter Reforged, and Haran Geppaku Futsu. If you have a spare of any of these weapons, then I recommend using that instead of pulling for Alhaitham’s signature.</p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">If you consistently buy the Battle Pass, then Wolf-Fang is a good 4-star Sword for Alhaitham. With Refinements, it’s competitive with some of the 5-stars above.</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Alhaitham’s best free-to-play weapons are Toukabou Shigure, Iron Sting, and Harbinger of Dawn. You should only consider pulling for Alhaitham’s signature if you don’t like the prospect of using these. Even then, spending $10-50 on Battle Passes might be more cost-efficient than gambling on the weapon banner.</p>

No matter the side you start with, you’re tasked with assembling a legion of warriors to maneuver across the environment. The developers are promising new mechanics to learn and use against your foe. Both factions also seem to sport their own way of clearing a battlefield, with the Adeptus Mechanicus keen on using cover, whereas the Necrons are more likely to just blow it all to hell. I like these guys. </p>

<p data-characters="234" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Vivian was always a great partner in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, but she was given a bit of a boost around the release of the Switch version. If she’s caught your attention, you might be wondering when she joins your party.</p> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false"><strong>Vivian joins your party in Chapter 4</strong>. It’s probably no surprise since <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> doesn’t give you very much player agency, but there’s no way to get her sooner.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">She starts the game as an antagonist. She’s part of The Three Shadows along with her sisters Marilyn and Beldam. Beldam, the eldest and de facto leader of the group is verbally abusive, constantly belittling Vivian and blaming her for her own mistakes.</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">In Chapter 4, Vivian has once again been blamed for Beldam’s mistake and is left searching for the Superbombomb, an explosive device with unknown (but presumably high) yield. After Mario has his name and body stolen, he assists Vivian in finding it, though it’s discovered broken. Not realizing that it’s her sister’s enemy she’s talking to, she agrees to help him recover his stolen moniker.</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Vivian joins as a party member at that moment. Since the rest of Mario’s party has been fooled into following his doppelganger, she spends time as his <em>only</em> party member. This continues through the battle at the end of Chapter 4.</p> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">Before that battle, Vivian learns of Mario’s true identity. Initially, fearing the wrath of her sister, she abandons Mario, but returns saying that he’s the only person who ever treated her kindly. From that point forward, she’s a permanent fixture on the team.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-are-vivian-s-abilities" data-injectable="false">What are Vivian’s abilities?</h2> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Vivian is one of the best partners in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. Her field ability has her draw Mario into the shadows where enemies (and NPCs) won’t notice him. This is used in the game’s puzzles to allow you to eavesdrop on some characters to get them to speak openly and unaware.</p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">Her initial HP is 15. In battle, her default attack is <strong>a flaming punch called Shade Fist</strong>. This does direct damage and can also set enemies on fire. You won’t want to use this against fire-based enemies, as fire attacks heal them, and since it’s a direct attack, will result in Vivian getting hurt.</p> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">Veil requires 1 FP and draws Mario into the shadows where enemies can’t hit him. The downside is that, on the turn where they re-appear, Vivian’s turn is used up.</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">After <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-level-up-your-partners-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading Vivian o</a>nce, she’ll reach 20 max HP. She’ll also learn the move Fiery Jinx, which uses 6 FP. Again, it’s a fire attack, but this one damages all enemies. While you still don’t want to use this on fire-based enemies since it will heal them, it does indirect damage, so Vivian won’t be hurt by them.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">On the second upgrade, Vivian reaches 30 HP. She learns the skill Infatuate, which has her blow them a kiss. Any enemy affected will become confused.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-is-vivian-actually-transgender" data-injectable="false">Is Vivian actually transgender?</h2> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">What has brought Vivian into the spotlight is the revelation (for some) that she’s transgender in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. It’s new information for most because the English translation of the original GameCube version omitted this.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">In the Switch version, this has been changed to better reflect the original Japanese script. She says the line: “Truth is, it took me a while to realize I was their sister… not their brother. Now their usual bullying feels heavier.”</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">While that doesn’t <em>directly</em> say it, it would require some extreme mental gymnastics to read any other inference from it. To add to this, the original Japanese script already implied that she’s transgender, although culturally, that’s a little less clear. That’s a whole topic in itself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, most other translations retain the idea that Vivian is transgender. It’s only German and English that alter the script to remove the reference.</p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">You may wonder why it was changed back in 2004. While it’s true that 2004 was a very different time in terms of LGBTQ+ acceptance, that’s most likely not the whole story. Rather than concern for offending parent groups, Nintendo probably had the line changed to avoid getting a T for Teen rating from the ESRB.</p>
 <p data-characters="595" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">In 2000, <em>The Sims</em> was given a Teen rating. This might seem certain today, given its mild references to sex, alcohol, and drugs. However, the original version of <em>The Sims</em> didn’t have any of that. The first real allusion to Sims having sex was introduced in the first expansion pack <em>Livin’ Large</em>. While the T rating also cites Comic Mischief and Mild Animated Violence, it describes the sexual content as “Mature Sexual Content.” What it’s likely referring to is the fact that same-sex Sims can kiss and have relationships. That <em>is</em> something that was in the original version of <em>The Sims</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">Another instance is with 2005’s <em>Playboy: The Mansion</em>. Despite being based on what was, at the time, a pornographic magazine, the base version only received an M rating because the sexual content wasn’t explicit. However, the expansion, <em>Playboy: The Mansion: Private Party</em>, received an AO rating. What changed? The female stars could have relations with other females.</p> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="false">As established, 2004 was a different time for LGBTQ+ representation. It’s still possible that Nintendo had the line changed to prevent reaction from various groups or even internal transphobia. However, I feel the more likely explanation is that they didn’t want to lose the E for Everybody rating.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-4-7-release-date-lands-next-month.880590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-47-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 4.7 release date, with a new Challenge Domain, new playable characters, and much more arriving in June.</p>

<p>Otherwise known as "An Everlasting Dream Intertwined" (for this is how&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Versions are usually named), Version 4.7 arrives on June 5th, and it packs a nice additional challenge for those who want more bang for their (lack of) buck.</p>

<p>The first big new addition coming in Version 4.7 is the Imaginarium Theater, a new Challenge Domain that resets each month. It gives you a chance to earn big rewards by participating in combat challenges with specific restrictions on things like elements and character choices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-4.7-release-date-imaginarium-theater.jpg?itok=RG97f_-B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-4.7-release-date-imaginarium-theater.jpg?itok=XZB1uXno 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might sound like a prog album, but the Imaginarium Theater is&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s newest Challenge Domain.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new characters are also being introduced in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 4.7, and after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-46-release-date">Version 4.6</a> introduced the game's first Bond of Life character, that mechanic is making a reappearance in the new update as well.</p>

<p>Five-star Electro sword user Clorinde can accumulate Bond of Life in her Night Vigil state, then clear that accumulation to heal herself, although any healing she receives in Night Vigil will contribute to her Bond of Life instead.</p>

<p>The second Bond of Life user is Sigewinne, a 5-star Hydro bow user who can use her Bond of Life to help her party members. She's best used with other Bond of Life characters, as her healing increases based on the total Bond of Life in your party.</p>

<p>Lastly,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 4.7 brings 4-star Electro archer Sethos. He'll feature alongside Clorinde and an Alhaitham rerun in the Event Wishes for the first half of the update, while the second half will bring Sigewinne and a rerun for Furina.</p>




<p>Version 4.7 also brings a new tower defense minigame, as well as an increase in the Original Resin cap from 160 to 200.</p>

<p>HoYoverse has also released a sneak peek of the new Natlan nation, which will be coming to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>"later this year". You can check out that teaser below.</p>




<p>As ever, the announcement of this new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version also brings with it three codes that you can use to grab some new items. You'll have to be quick, though! Here they are.</p>

<ul><li>US2VLGSXCAT9: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>6A2ULZTFVBCV: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>BS3DLYAFVAUH: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now across PC, PlayStation, and mobile devices. Version 4.7 launches on June 5th.</p>

<p>Since launching in a closed beta in early May, Arena Breakout: Infinite has become a hit with extraction shooter fans looking for something different from Escape From Tarkov. Insider Gaming recently had the opportunity to talk with Arena Breakout: Infinite producer Yiming&nbsp;(Onrry) Sun for an exclusive interview.</p>



<p>In the interview, we talk about the beta’s success and feedback from players, allegations of plagiarism from Battlestate Games, avoiding the PR nightmare that Battlestate Games found itself in, a possible console release and more.</p>

<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-interview">Arena Breakout: Infinite Interview</h2>



<h4>With the game being in closed beta for a bit now, what’s been the feedback from players that you’ve experienced? What are some positives and even negatives to take away from the players?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>We’re thrilled about the overwhelming love and excitement we’ve seen from players worldwide for Arena Breakout: Infinite since the start of our beta test. In less than a month, total beta signups on our official website and Steam wishlists have both surpassed 1 million. We now also have almost 400,000 members in our Discord community. These metrics have surpassed our expectations, especially considering the beta launched a handful of weeks ago.</em></p>



<p><em>Many players have expressed their excitement about Arena Breakout: Infinite on social media and within our community. Even the well-known streamer Shroud stated during one of his streams: “This is probably the best extraction shooter that’s currently out… (It has) the best quality of life I think I have ever seen.”</em></p>



<p><em>As we continue development, we have received valuable feedback and suggestions from players around the globe regarding game optimization, bug reports, server performance, and more. We greatly value player feedback, and we are fully committed to addressing and resolving these issues in future updates.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4>How do you go about convincing players on the fence to try the game? Some might look and think it’s just a mobile game and not want to give it a second thought.</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>Since the beta test started, we’ve had nearly 2,000 streamers broadcasting Arena Breakout: Infinite live on Twitch, accumulating over 36,000 hours of on-air time. I think this overwhelming response from so many PC streamers speaks for itself.</em></p>



<p><em>We started development on Arena Breakout: Infinite&nbsp; before the global release of AB mobile – it’s been three years now. ABI was designed and optimized for the PC platform from the very beginning, incorporating elements tailored to suit the preferences and habits of PC FPS players. It is not simply a matter of porting AB mobile to a different platform, as some might assume.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Furthermore, with the enhanced hardware performance of PC devices, we have been able to explore more intricate design and production elements, including lighting, weather, in-game TOD, and more VFX in the current version and upcoming updates.</em></p>



<p><em>I am confident that once players enter the game, they will immediately recognize that ABI is a game originally created for the PC platform.</em></p>



<h4>Will mobile and PC players be able to play together, or are they two separate games entirely?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun:</strong> <em>Arena Breakout: Infinite and Arena Breakout mobile are two separate games. Considering the differences in ease of operation between mobile and PCs, which can potentially result in game balance issues, we have decided not to implement cross-platform gameplay.</em></p>



<h4>Will there be a console release?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>For now, our main focus will be on the PC platform, where we will continue refining and expanding the content and gameplay of our game. Considering the mechanical differences between consoles and PCs (controller vs. keyboard) and their influence on extraction shooter gameplay, we recognize a console release will require thorough research and thoughtful deliberation to ensure an enhanced control experience.</em></p>



<p><em>Please stay tuned to our official announcements for any updates regarding new platforms.</em></p>



<h4>What can you say of the accusations and allegations from Battlestate Games about plagiarism in Arena Breakout: Infinite? They seem to be going pretty heavy handed with them.</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and believe in the importance of IP protection. The alleged copyright infringement is untrue. Our current focus is ensuring the beta continues to run smoothly so that we receive player feedback and deliver the best game we can make, rather than getting caught up in the noise on Twitter.</em></p>



<h4>Speaking of BSG and the Escape from Tarkov drama over the last few weeks, how can you make sure that More Fun and Arena Breakout: Infinite doesn’t have the same communication problems with its audience?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>I believe the key lies in maintaining positive and effective two-way communication with our players worldwide as game developers. From the global release of AB mobile to now Arena Breakout: Infinite, we have consistently prioritized listening to the community. Since the beta test started, we have established various user communication channels, including in-game channels, official social media platforms, Discord groups, and more. These channels ensure that we can receive timely feedback and suggestions from players and streamers around the world.</em></p>



<p><em>Additionally, we have conducted multiple user interviews and hosted “Developer AMA” sessions to keep the community informed about our latest progress and provide transparent responses. We value all feedback we’ve received from our players.</em></p>



<h4>Obviously free-to-play means monetization in some way, what are the plans for monetization in the game and how can you make sure the game doesn’t become a pay-to-win experience that alienates players and turns them away?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>Thanks for bringing up this question. I know this is something that many players care and are concerned about.</em></p>



<p><em>First of all, I firmly believe that “Free to Play” does not equate to “Pay to Win.” We have adopted the “F2P” model so that anyone interested in ABI can download and play the game without any barriers.</em></p>



<p><em>While there will be paid content options available in ABI, they have no impact on gameplay or fairness. Instead, they offer convenience and personalization features. Players have the option to pay for certain conveniences, such as safes, extra warehouse space, battle pass, as well as personalized appearances and melee weapons. However, it’s important to note that players who pay gain no direct advantage in combat abilities. The in-game economic system will not be designed to push players to “pay for in-game money.” We will ensure that the majority of players can get sufficient in-game money without paying to support a positive gaming experience.</em></p>



<p><em>In Arena Breakout Infinite, paying does not guarantee victory. Even if you are fully equipped, there is still a high chance of defeat from other players – you could still lose everything. Victory or defeat are determined by factors such as shooting skill, tactical ability, and a deep understanding of the game, all of which cannot be bought.</em></p>



<h4>What is being done to combat any potential hacking or cheaters? We know there’s an anti-cheat but is there more to stop it from happening? Are there plans in place to prevent banned players from creating new accounts?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>Arena Breakout: Infinite uses advanced algorithms and real-time monitoring systems to detect and fight against cheating behavior, ensuring a fair and clean gaming environment. Our experience dealing with cheating issues during the release of AB mobile has given us valuable insight and allows us to enhance our ability to tackle blackmail and cheaters in the PC version.</em></p>



<p><em>Unfortunately, no technology can guarantee a 100% anti-cheating rate. There’s also the risk of false banning. We will continuously refine and optimize our anti-cheating algorithms and methods based on extensive testing and feedback from the community.</em></p>



<p><em>With this in mind, we will be introducing a “Kill Cam” feature in an upcoming version, which will enable players to better assess whether or not they were defeated by cheaters.</em></p>



<h4>Aside from being free to play, what would you say makes Arena Breakout: Infinite different from other extraction shooters? Why should someone give the game a try?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>Arena Breakout: Infinite is the first free-to-play GaaS (Games as a Service) extraction shooter on the market, and we are committed to providing players with sustainable content and services. This is one of our strong competitive advantages. The gameplay of ABI is straightforward: equip, fight, and extract. Every aspect of the game is designed with this core gameplay loop in mind.</em></p>



<p><em>Unlike many other extraction shooters where players need to play daily to obtain loot and avoid falling behind, Arena Breakout takes a different approach. Players can join at any time during the season and have a unique experience. Our focus is on providing a repeatable and sustainable single-match-based experience, rather than emphasizing RPG-style accumulation. Our current motto is, “easy come, easy play, easy go, easy return.”&nbsp; We hope to lower the barrier of entry to extraction shooters, allowing more people to enjoy the genre.</em></p>



<h4>Player data has been at the front of conversations lately. What is being done to keep player information safe, especially when it’s a game that will allow players to spend real money?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>We adhere strictly to the data security regulations of each country, and we ensure the proper and secure storage of players’ game data. We highly prioritize the privacy and protection of players’ data.</em></p>



<h4>Is there a development roadmap in place for the game? What type of updates are planned for the game post release? Any new game modes or maps?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>We will be focusing on two main parts. The first part involves creating a diverse range of maps, weapons, and additional content to ensure an enjoyable gaming experience for different types of players, including both casual and hardcore gamers. We will continue to introduce new maps, weapons, game modes, and other elements to maintain a healthy and engaging cycle of game content.</em></p>



<p><em>Additionally, as a GaaS title, we recognize the importance of providing good services alongside game content. This includes optimizing game performance, implementing effective anti-cheating measures, fine-tuning the economic system, balancing gameplay mechanics, and more. This commitment to service-based content will be a long-term focus for us.</em></p>



<h4>Do you have a timetable or a set release date for 1.0 of Arena Breakout: Infinite?</h4>



<p><strong>Yiming&nbsp;Sun: </strong><em>Due to the overwhelming response and feedback, we plan to continue the CBT for Arena Breakout: Infinite for an extended period as we look to launch the game later this year. Stay tuned for more official announcements soon!</em></p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers </em>community has had a rough time lately, and the community just failed a third Major Order. But things may be turning around. A new Major Order has arrived, and victory means a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1793674703359353305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new dual-autocannon Exosuit</a> for <em>Helldivers 2</em> players. And they only have to liberate a single Automaton planet.</p> <p data-characters="21" data-current-count="21" data-injectable="false">What could go wrong? </p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">The news was announced by the development team following the end of the recent Major Order. Players weren’t able to rack up the 3 billion enemy kills needed, so one could say that the MO to follow feels like a reprieve: Liberate the planet Varylia 5 to halt the Automaton “Petafactory,” and you will earn the EXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit. Mechs <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-patch-fixes-the-paper-mache-mechs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be better now</a>, so don’t worry.<br></p>

Compared to dusting more than 3.14 billion foes, however, liberating one Automaton planet should be easier than pi. The planet itself, Varylia 5 (located in the Trigon sector), is already available for dives. You won’t need to liberate other planets to free up <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-supply-lines-in-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the supply line</a>; the fight begins today.</p>
 <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Successfully completing the Major Order awards the EXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit, the first new mech <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-helldivers-2-exosuit-mech-stratagem-has-been-unlocked-and-is-now-available-for-purchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since March</a>. Equipped with two autocannons, the mech is ideal for taking out heavies <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-how-to-kill-a-bile-titan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as the Bile Titan</a>, but it can also deal plenty of damage to enemy spawners, dropships, and other destructible targets. </p> <figure data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">As a fan of the autocannon, this pleases me (and so does that Personal Order). The MO will also award you with 50 Warbond Medals, which should come in handy if you haven’t gotten everything out of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-everything-in-the-polar-patriots-warbond-and-their-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Warbond</a>.</p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">The Major Order ends in five days, which should be more than enough time to clear a planet of bots. Fans on Reddit seem excited. Following the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-steps-down-so-he-can-focus-more-on-actually-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO’s move</a> to the development side of things, with luck, this could be the start of a much-needed rebound.</p>

 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Clorinde is a 5-star on-field Electro DPS. She uses her Elemental Skill to infuse her Normal Attacks with Electro, then uses alternating combos of Normal Attacks and Skills to deal damage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/hunt-showdown-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-versions-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crytek">Crytek</a> has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> will finally make its debut on current gen home consoles, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. This comes as part of a major update for the popular extraction shooter that will see a technical overhaul as well as a “mountain” of new content rolled out during the summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Developer Update | Date Reveal | Hunt: Showdown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will include a brand new Hunt: Showdown map, an updated user experience, and an upgrade to CRYENGINE 5.11. Besides giving PC players a nice little boost, this will also beef up the visuals and performance for the newly-announced PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions albeit with a slight caveat. When the upgrade lands on August 15th, 2024, Crytek will effectively end support for Hunt: Showdown on PS4 and Xbox One. Those who play on these systems will be entitled to a free upgrade with their progress and DLC carrying over.</p>
<p>These changes mark a new era for Hunt: Showdown and one that will hopefully attract a new wave of fans as well as lapsed veterans. Shutting down those last gen versions is bound to impact a minority yet, as someone who plays on PS4, I’ve often felt as though Sony’s old hardware has been holding me back, especially when matched with PC gamers via online cross-play.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown is easily one of the best extraction shooters out there, mainly thanks to being one of the genre’s first pioneers. After entering early access in 2018, it quickly garnered a loyal fanbase who fell in love with its dark atmosphere and tense PvP, competing with other bounty hunters to track and kill a dark menagerie of monsters before making off with their loot.</p>


<p>Back when the game launched on PS4 and Xbox One, we scored it an 8/10 in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/11/hunt-showdown-review-console-ps4-xbox/">Hunt: Showdown review</a> saying:</p>
<p>“I’ll admit I wasn’t keen on Hunt: Showdown to start with, but after the first few matches I realised there’s something special here. This is an unusual entry in a genre ruled by far snappier shooters, and it takes time to get your head around Crytek’s clever twist on the formula. Stick with it and you’ll be rewarded with a uniquely engrossing multiplayer experience.”</p>
<p>What else is Crytek currently working on? After recently remastering its trilogy of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis">Crysis</a> games, the studio has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crysis-4">Crysis 4</a> is officially in the works. We’ll hopefully hear more about that project soon.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's free-to-play arena shooter XDefiant's first patch has been released.</p>
<p>Entitled <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/4IhHSi1KgvXFeiFHIEZMga">"Preseason Patch 1"</a>, it addresses a number of specific issues, including one with loading into the Practice Zone – some players found themselves "in a hellscape" outside the world – and another that sees devices dropped at players' feet should they die during device deployment. Up until now, they would still be thrown as if you hadn't just carked it.</p>
<p>This means Practice Zone has been turned back on, although the team warns "it's possible weird things could still happen". So make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Also, that issue "where you'd get hitmarkers on an enemy as they killed you, but their health bar still appeared full to you?" Turns out the health bar display was wrong and you did indeed damage them. That "should be fixed now", along with one bug that displayed end-of-match text with the wrong orientation in Arabic and another that was causing low framerates for some AMD GPU users.</p><p>
ot
</p><p>This should be great news for the millions of players who jumped onto XDefiant as soon as it launched. According to Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, the shooter hit one million unique players within just two and a half hours of going live, which is quite a feat given the now seemingly prerequisite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-like-shooter-xdefiant-faces-the-typical-matchmaking-woes-on-launch">release day matchmaking issues</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, cheaters have already found their way into XDefiants ranks, and right now there's not much players can do about it. XDefiant uses BattleEye, the same anti-cheat system engaged in Rainbow Six Siege and… well, anyone who's spent any time at all with Siege will know that cheaters are rife.</p>
<p>"Seen a post on Twitter about the Anti-Cheat. Only knew it was a matter of time before the cheating community managed to find a bypass," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cyj42j/comment/l5azkrh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one unhappy player. "Things will only get worse from here, and it’s only pre-season. Net code and Anti-cheat should’ve been the things to prioritise from the start. Gameplay and everything else could’ve been handled over time."</p>
<p>"I'd say I'm encountering one cheater every 2-3 games, which is kinda annoying af," added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cyj42j/comment/l5aozu3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">another</a>. "Best way to get rid of them is to make them play exclusively against each other. That'd be fun."</p>

</span></p><p>Ubisoft's Tom Clancy-adjacent free-to-play shooter XDefiant finally launched for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 21st May, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">delays</a>.

            <p>We've known for some time that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-is-headed-to-fortnites-next-season">Fallout was coming</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, we just weren't entirely sure in what capacity. Well, now we know that this season's wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a> affair. There's a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fortnite's new season (Chapter 5, Season 3) is out right this second and the map's been hit with a big old sandstorm that's birthed a new Wasteland biome. It's home to red earth and a gang of unruly folks called the "Wasteland Warriors", who drive juiced up scrap on wheels. Their base of operations is a ship they've the front out of, making it look like a shark's head. It's actually pretty cool, to be fair.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the new map layout, via a Xweet:</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>For me, highlights include rocket-propelled metal gloves called the Nitro Fists, that let you charge powerful uppercuts or perform aerial punches that dash you through the air. And as a personal fan of driving about, this season seems entirely aimed at folks like me. There's a bunch of new car mods, letting you attach machine guns or grenade launchers or spiked bumpers to your ride. This is good, because I find battle royales are at their finest when you've got groups of people accidentally bumping into each other in metal boxes and then panic-fighting.</p>
<p>There's also a couple of metal boxes to be wary of, and that's in the form of War Buses. They're like the Battle Bus but Mad Max-ified, with two cannons on top and a horn that produces an EMP pulse capable of disabling vehicles or hurting enemy shields. You'll find AI baddies driving two of these things around the map, and acting as a sort of hotspot for control. Fend everyone off, including the AI baddies, and your squad gets a honkin' great war wagon - lovely. </p>
<p>I also like the fact Epic have thought how to best a bunch of vehicles if you're vehicleless. The new Boom Bolt crossbow shoots explosive bolts that'll total cars and War Buses in only a few hits if you're accurate enough.</p>
<p>If you're after all the tweaks and changes, you can find them over on Epic's <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/crash-the-party-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked?lang=en-US">patch notes page</a>.</p>

			<p>Polish developer 11 bit studios is mostly known to gamers for This War of Mine and Frostpunk, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a>, they are doing something very different. It's a sci-fi survival game where you play as miner Jan Dolski, who is stranded on an alien planet and must find a way to repair his mobile base and get the hell out of the planet before the local sun's lethal radiation kills him.</p>
<p>This is not a one-person job, to say the least. Thankfully, Jan has technology at his disposal that allows him to create the titular Alters, alternate copies of himself who made different decisions at key points in Jan's life. It's an intriguing premise, and we dig into it throughout the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview that just went live.</a></p>
<p>We also got the chance to interview Lead Designer Rafał Włosek to learn more about the making of The Alters and its feature set. Keep scrolling after the embedded video to read the full transcript</p>
<p>The game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X sometime this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>I think the first question, just from playing it, is, what was the inspiration behind creating The Alters? It's quite unique, at least in the actual thematic nature of just creating multiple versions of yourself to get yourself out of that jam.</strong></p>
<p>Well, the process is always very complicated, not only creating the prototype but also trying to figure out what game we're going to make. At 11 bit, it always starts more from the idea of the topic we would like to talk about. Not from the idea of the gameplay. It was the same this time as well.</p>
<p>There was a lot of brainstorming in general, but we always had this idea about creating a game about how our lives could go if we made different decisions. This was slowly getting more and more concrete when we were talking about it and finally figured out that we wanted to have a game where the player could actually experience meeting a different version of himself who&nbsp;made this different decision.</p>
<p>Then we thought it would work great in a sci-fi environment, where you could use many different sci-fi technologies to achieve&nbsp;effects that are not so easily achieved in real life, for example. And then, well, there was also this idea about making copies of your own self and interacting with them.</p>
<p>It's very hard to say that it was like a single idea. It was more like an iterative process to get there.</p>
<p><strong>I noticed you use many links to cloning in real life. The first thing you create is Molly, a reference to the first cloned sheep. I'm guessing you've got a few amusing Easter eggs in the game.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we do. Definitely, it's not by accident that we put the sheep there. But I guess this is more like, you know, a bit of humor. Actually, we want to put a lot of small humorous things here and there because our previous games were very heavy, let's say. I was also a lead designer of This War of Mine and we didn't want to repeat that. So, this is where it comes from. However, this is not a game about cloning.</p>
<p><strong>Indeed. I've created the technician in the demo, and it links into This War of Mine in the sense of the emotions, like immediately, every single conversation piece you're doing has a big effect on their mood. So, yeah, the technician really doesn't like me so far.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, there is this obvious situation where you create a new person just to move forward and he's very disoriented and probably feels used by you. But there's also this other layer of it, more symbolic, where you are trying to actually cope with your own self, your own different version when you are trying to figure out which decision was good. Do I like this decision or&nbsp;not?</p>
<p>Which version of myself would I like the most? But of course, we don't want to answer this question. We just ask them.</p>
<p><strong>You want the player to explore those questions themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It would be very unfortunate if we tried to give an answer.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously, you create the technician because that's what the story demands at that point. As you go forward, do you get to make more choices in which path you create? Is it linear progression, or do you get that flexibility to create what you want?</strong></p>
<p>We definitely wanted to create something that we could work on in much detail because the story in this game is the most important part, and in order to do it real good, we preferred to create some solid branching points in which we can have much more control. All of them have their different stories. They are very well connected to each other, not to mention very well connected with different problems that the player has. So yeah, this is more prepared.</p>
<p><strong>With survival games, by the nature of gameplay, you tend to get a lot of replay value from that. As you said, there's key branching points in The Alters. Are you going to have different ways of the characters reacting to what you say to them? Will there also be replay elements, like where you travel to? Is it directed as to where you go Essentially, how long can you survive?</strong></p>
<p>This is kind of a tricky question because there's many layers the game operates on. It's not just a survival game where you have a huge amount of replayability, but it's also not closed like a story-driven game. In order to answer your question well, I would have to put some background in it.</p>
<p>We created the game in the form of layers. The top layer would be the main storyline. It's the story of Jan, who is trying to survive on this planet. He's also looking into his past life and trying to deal with his own past decisions, problems, and insecurities.</p>
<p>Then there is another layer of all the Alters and as the first layer is always more or less, well, one story. It has a lot of endings, but it's one story. Then you have the Alters and you cannot have them all in one playthrough. Each Alter has his own story and shows you different parts, different Jan versions. So, you can't know Jan entirely playing the game just once. Finally, we have a third part, which includes mechanics that come from the emotions of the Alters, the interaction between each other, the interaction between you and them, and the way you treat them.</p>
<p>You can push them in many different directions. Maybe you can try to use them more or try to be the best for them, but then you cannot fulfill the mission as well. Depending on your choices, the gameplay will differ, of course.</p>
<p><strong>So it will branch quite a little bit in that. As an example, could you alienate one of your relatives, really piss them off so they don't want to help you at all, and you've got to find other ways of doing things?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, for example. In general, this comes with many different gameplay flairs. Of course, there's the strategy version then because it's also a strategic and survival game, depending on what technology you achieve and research and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, to round it all up, I think you could have a couple of playthroughs that lead you to different stories, allow you to explore different aspects of Jan, and maybe have different endings because they might differ a lot. But it's not as replayable as the typical open-world survival game.</p>
<p><strong>Which is good because you can't really have a good directed narrative in that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Alters-Preview-03-Image-01.png"></a></figure>

<p><strong>As you mentioned, you chose the sci-fi setting because it allows you to use the sci-fi technology for that. One of the first things I just noticed is that the setting is you've crash-landed on this planet in a three-star system. I couldn't help but think whether any particular media inspired you in creating this.</strong></p>
<p>No. Well, you're talking about planets, right?</p>
<p><strong>The setting that popped into my head is probably just because I've recently seen the new Netflix TV series The Three Body Problem.</strong></p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p><strong>Because you've got three stars, and you've got the sun just going to come and burn.</strong></p>
<p>As always, there's a couple of layers. First of all, there's art, and I'm not much in this art process because I'm a designer.&nbsp;So, I didn't want to mess up anything that&nbsp;they were up to.</p>
<p>But I know that the general idea for the look for the planet was to create a desolate and empty but beautiful alien world that creates a special environment for Jan to think about his life. He's outside of the normal world. That would be probably the most important part. I don't think it came from some specific book or film. As to the three-body system, I was the one who designed the star system, and I'm very much a space and astronomy amateur. I have my telescope watching the stars and so on, and I was just trying to figure out the best possible star system that would allow the strange situation in which you have to run away from one side. Only much later I watched the series and saw the book.</p>
<p><strong>From what I've played so far, it's genuinely a very great looking game. With the Rapidium crystals, I genuinely asked somebody, is this effect a bug? But no, it's not a bug. At first I wondered if it was gravity from the stars, but it's not that either.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I know that our art director wanted this Rapidium thing to look very much like it's some kind of a glitch, something outside of our universe, let's say of our reality, so unreal it doesn't actually fit exactly. But at the same time, it fits very well.</p>
<p>Oh, they've done a great job because, like I said, the first time I saw it, I was like, is that a bug? Anyway, The Alters looks genuinely great. It does seem like, as with your previous games, emotion is a key part of this. As well as Jannis looking inward, trying to figure out everything that's happened to him in his past and creating the Alters, it is about the what if and how he deals with that.</p>
<p>Yes. So, every Alter comes from a different decision in your life. The origin of the difference is very obvious, so you always have some kind of reference. This one specific thing that made me this person or that. Of course, in real life, it's not that easy. But, on the other hand, there's a lot of situations when we are trying to figure out what would have happened if I changed this one single decision that made me a different man, different friends, different goals in life and values, and so on. This is what happens in Jan's head.</p>
<p><strong>The only other question is how many Alters are there?</strong></p>
<p>This must be the question that didn't get the answer. *laughs* We are trying to set the number so that there is not too much chaos and that the story would be complete and all the answers would be given. I guess it's well-balanced, I would say.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything that you'd like to say about The Alters that I haven't asked?</strong></p>
<p>I like one particular thing about this game, but it's not easily spotted right away when playing it. I'm really proud of how our team managed to combine the story, the narrating stories of all the Alters, with the game mechanics and survival mechanics. They all fit together and were built from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p>

No two consecutive movies in the franchise have ever been the same, and most of them aren’t even remotely similar to each other, save for the themes of the Wasteland and the idea of a lone wanderer doing their best to survive. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, the newest movie in the series, may be the biggest exception to that rule: While the movie is explicitly a prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Fury Road</em></a>, it draws its biggest inspirations from the original 1979 <em>Mad Max</em>, giving Max and Furiosa similarly tragic origin stories. </p>
<p id="wWcE09">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Furiosa</em>.]</p>
<p id="w5IoFi">Five movies into the series, with each <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller">bigger, louder</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders">more bombastic than the last</a>, it’s easy to forget that George Miller started Max Rockatansky’s story with a simple movie about roving gangs and a man facing a personal tragedy. </p>
<p id="gcQ2m9">The original <em>Mad Max</em> starts before Australia fully descends into the Wasteland chaos the series would later be known for. While Max’s homestead, where he lives with his wife and child, isn’t as idyllic as Furiosa’s Green Place, it seems as beautiful and peaceful a place as anyone could ask for. At least, until a marauding band of highway raiders comes along. Once they arrive, they quickly kill Max’s family, setting him on a path of eternal vengeance and turning him into the Road Warrior we know him as in the rest of the films. </p>

<p id="g0wKrQ">In this way, it feels like <em>Furiosa</em> is almost a remake of the original movie, done up with the budget and beautiful fury Miller has spent the last 45 years perfecting. Furiosa similarly had her peaceful life stolen from her, and her closest family murdered by a gang of marauders, but Miller has adjusted the story this time. Instead of taking most of the movie to show us the bad guys and set up the deterioration of the world, Miller leans on the history of the series, letting <em>Fury Road</em>’s strong world-building in particular fill in the blanks for us. </p>
<p id="hoduE1">We already know the important players and landmarks here: Furiosa herself, Immortan Joe, the Citadel, Gastown, and the Bullet Farm, all introduced in <em>Fury Road</em>. That gives Miller more time to expand on <em>Mad Max</em>’s most effective element: Max’s unbridled rage after his family is attacked. Miller makes Furiosa’s version of this anger the centerpiece of her movie, and turns it into an epic quest that spans more than a decade. He even gives us a similar (though infinitely more twisted) version of Max’s slow, indirect final kill in the movie, with Furiosa letting Dementus die an agonizing death inside a tree. </p>

<p id="cQWs42">All of these little echoes serve as excellent fodder for fans who might want to draw connections between entries in the series. But they’re even more important for deepening the relationship Max and Furiosa share in <em>Fury Road</em>. That movie does a tremendous job of setting up the unspoken bond the two share, like a quiet recognition that they both live with the weight of tremendous loss in their pasts. But it isn’t until we get to see those connections made explicit in <em>Furiosa </em>that we understand just how similar their tragedies actually are. </p>
<p id="K9fbrM"><em>Furiosa</em> is the rare prequel that does more than just tell us a character’s origin story: It deepens our understanding of the entire world she occupies. By connecting Max and Furiosa’s origins, Miller brings the entire Mad Max franchise full circle. Knowing Max and Furiosa are truly kindred spirits, created and driven by the same tragedy and rage, recontextualizes <em>Fury Road</em>’s ending, giving us renewed hope for Max. He’s never seemed like someone who could one day move forward into a better future, rather than just wandering the Wasteland forever — but seeing Furiosa find peace suggests he might be able to as well. But we couldn’t get to that point without Miller bridging <em>Furiosa </em>back to the franchise’s roots, to tap into the same energy that made Max mad in the first place. </p>

One gets lucky, the other doesn’t. Let’s set about changing that.</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere. You can support the project </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/buriedtreasure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>via its Patreon</em></a></span><em>.</em></p></div><p><em>Master Key</em> is the 2D <em>Zelda</em> format distilled to its purest form. It’s a monochrome RPG in which you play an adorable fox, exploring an ever-growing territory as you earn new abilities that allow access to new areas. The map begins shrouded in clouds, each section revealed as you reach it, until you’ve discovered multiple biomes, temples, dungeons, and boss fights. And despite being “monochrome” (it defaults to black and white, with options in the settings to pick your own dual colour-scheme), it’s beautifully detailed, with a huge number of distinct enemy types, gorgeously animated, and each fought differently with your increasingly interesting range of attacks.<br></p><p>So yeah, that rather clinically explains that it delivers all the correct ingredients. What’s far more important is how well it’s done. <em>Master Key</em> is just so wonderfully crafted, a constant drip-feed of new abilities opening up new areas, letting you always feel as though you’re progressing. Reach a point where you’re stuck, and the world map (which I’m fairly certain is just the live game running at a tinier scale) will flash a region you should explore further. You’ll inevitably find the passageway you missed, or the secret entrance it’s hinting you toward, or the NPC with an item you need. And then there’s that dopamine hit of realising you’ve now got another whole swathe of game to explore.</p><p>There’s no talking in the game, other characters instead communicating in the simplest pictogram speech bubbles. And yet, everyone feels characterful. Where the game isn’t dumping exposition on me, I find I’m filling in the narrative for myself, imagining motivations for this little fox. It’s all adorable.</p><p>It’s also absolutely bursting with secrets, puzzles, and surprises. There are some pretty in-depth puzzles in there, some dungeons offering bespoke challenges that require a fair amount of head-scratching. At some points you’ll see rocks with peculiar patterns on them, and begin noting them down in case they become useful later. (Spoiler: they will.) Every area feels like it’s hiding something extra, making it always worth revisiting areas you’ve not seen for a while in case your bucket of new skills now lets you reach a formerly irrelevant-looking platform, or reveals an entire new dungeon.</p><p>The abilities are the ones any right-minded person desires. So yes, there’s a splendid hook-shot for so satisfactorily zipping across gaps, and of course a boomerang for bonking distant enemies, alongside a bunch more that are only discovered a lot later. Thorough exploration is always rewarded with more bonus items that will unlock more health, non-vital but lovely bonus abilities, and piles of lovely money. So a new ability is a fresh chance to gather loads more of that, too.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-recommend-id="image://d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-format="jpg" data-width="2265" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A boss battle with a spoof of Bowser on one of his ships." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boss battle with a spoof of Bowser on one of his ships." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Achromi / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-recommend-id="image://d4ebbe0176b2235ba128e25f20f87a17" data-format="jpg" data-width="2265" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A boss battle with a spoof of Bowser on one of his ships." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, I’ve gotten properly stuck a couple of times, and I’m not alone. But there’s already a small but lovely community on Steam swapping hints, and a thread dedicated to those in the end-game sharing discoveries of the game’s deepest secrets. I’ve certainly been in there, looking for nudges, and at one point just outright begging for a clue. (Unfortunately the game hasn’t received any guides or YouTube walkthroughs yet, but hopefully if we all shout loudly enough about it, people will get more involved.)<br></p><p>This deserves to be a break-out success for developer Achromi, and it’s the eternal tale of frustration at the abysmal curation on Steam that it is not. (I have to admit, I do get a little cheesed off when I see more successful indies kvetching hopelessly about this on Twitter, rather than pointing their large followings toward supporting projects like <em>Buried Treasure</em> and many others.)</p><figure id="" data-id="d95346b40175700d68081464bb338990" data-recommend-id="image://d95346b40175700d68081464bb338990" data-format="jpg" data-width="2261" data-height="1269" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dungeon, with a grim reaper and a whole bunch of pots to smash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dungeon, with a grim reaper and a whole bunch of pots to smash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Achromi / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d95346b40175700d68081464bb338990" data-recommend-id="image://d95346b40175700d68081464bb338990" data-format="jpg" data-width="2261" data-height="1269" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dungeon, with a grim reaper and a whole bunch of pots to smash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s ridiculously cheap for a game of this size and complexity, and it’ll absorb you for many, many hours.

<p>In an official <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/marcus-teilman-resigns-from-the-position-of-ceo-at-his-own-request/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Fragbite confirmed that CEO Marcus Teilman has officially resigned, and Stefan Tengvall will now serve as an interim CEO. </p>



<p>The post explains that Teilman chose to resign in order to “pursue new challenges.” This remains quite vague, and the press release does not elaborate on Teilman’s plans. But Tengvall and the Board did thank him for his time as CEO.</p>



<p>Teilman will also “provide support to Stefan Tengvall” during the transitional period. Due to the shakeup, Sten Wranne will now take on Tengvall’s role as Chairman of the Board.</p>



<p>Tengvall elaborated on their goals as the interim CEO at Fragbite. They mentioned plans for a “cost reduction programme,” and “identifying opportunities for restructuring.” This may imply that serious reductions could be on the way, but that is only speculation.</p>



<p>The shift in leadership closely follows Fragbite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragbite-files-for-bankruptcy-for-fall-damage-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing for bankruptcy</a> for development studio Fall Damage. </p>



<p>Fragbite recently acquired Fall Damage in late 2023. However, a statement from Fragbite cited an “unsustainable financial situation,” following attempts to find a publisher for Fall Damage’s shooter Alara Prime.</p>



<p>Finding a publisher certainly seems more difficult as the industry remains rattled.  There are still plenty of layoffs, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two’s layoff announcement</a> from last April. But the search for an Alara Prime publisher still seems to be ongoing at this time.</p>
