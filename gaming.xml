                <p>Microsoft announced today that it is rolling out a beta version of Copilot for Gaming to mobile platforms. Testers on iOS and Android can now try out Microsoft's first attempt at integrating an AI assistant with its Xbox platform.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Microsoft shared that users of the beta version of the Xbox app for mobile can now try out Copilot for Gaming's chatbot functionality. The AI assistant is designed to link into your Xbox account and be able to answer questions about your Xbox history, current gameplay, games in general, and other topics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502812" data-ratio="0.559375" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502812"></a><figcaption>Copilot for Gaming is now in beta on the Xbox mobile app (via Microsoft).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg"></figure><p>Microsoft suggests that Copilot will be able to answer particularly specific or context-sensitive questions, such as advice on certain encounters in games, guidance on improving your Gamerscore, or particularly rare Achievements in certain games. Right now, Copilot incorporates your Xbox profile with information gathered from Bing searches, but Microsoft says that deeper personalization is in development. It's currently unclear exactly how often and in what way Copilot will be gathering information from profiles, and Microsoft has yet to explain how its answers might cite sources that it crawls while searching Bing. Finally, while Copilot is currently reactive--it waits for you to ask it something--Microsoft also states that <em>proactive </em>guidance for in-game activity is in the works.</p><p>The Copilot for Gaming beta is available in <a href="https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/05/Full-Region-List-for-Copilot-for-Gaming-Beta-Early-Testing-on-Mobile-Devices.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a bunch of countries</a> (including the US and Canada), but it has yet to launch in the UK and Europe. The company is working on bringing it to more regions in the future.</p><p>Microsoft has been quite active in announcing AI functionality coming to games. Earlier in May, for instance, it shared its plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-putting-its-copilot-ai-into-games-like-minecraft/1100-6523588/" data-ref-id="1100-6523588">integrating Copilot directly into Minecraft</a>. The tech giant has also increasingly proposed using AI to generate game content, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-carmack-defends-microsofts-ai-generated-quake-ii-level/1100-6530678/" data-ref-id="1100-6530678">its creation of a Quake II level using an AI model</a>.</p>

                <p>A new first-person, open-world RPG is climbing the Steam charts, and it may be a good choice for those who have already blasted through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered</a> and are looking to continue scratching that Skyrim itch.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon/" data-ref-id="5000-522553">Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon</a> is $45 and fully released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 23, having been in early access since 2023. It looks to have found an audience on Steam in particular, where as of writing it's the number three best-selling game and is only a few spots below Oblivion Remastered on the most-played charts. It also sports "Very positive" reviews on the platform.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hDQNtPceEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Heavily influenced by first-person RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-skyrim/2900-5554/" data-ref-id="2900-5554">games like Skyrim</a> and Oblivion, Tainted Grail takes place in a dark fantasy world inspired by Arthurian legend. It features branching storylines and morally ambiguous choices where players will shape the future of King Arthur's now ruined kingdom, according to the game's Steam page.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking for a massive open-world RPG to sink their teeth into will find plenty to do here, as the game's Steam page states Tainted Grail is 50-70 hours long and features over 200 side quests, spread out across the game's three distinct zones. When it comes to combat and character creation, players can freely swap between melee weapons, shields, magic, and throwable items.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Questline, a studio of about 50 people, makes clear that players can create various archetypes ranging from a "blacksmith-mage summoning undead hordes" to a "stealthy archer lurking in the shadows." Just like in The Elder Scrolls, there is also crafting in the form of blacksmithing, alchemy, and cooking, as well as farming, journaling, fishing, and more. Also like Like in Elder Scrolls, Tainted Grail can technically be played in third-person, but was built for first-person in mind. Questline called the third-person option "playable but far from perfect."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer has already outlined some of the updates players can expect following the game's launch, including bug fixes, mod support, and additional content. It's also working to improve the game's performance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For those curious whether Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon could be their next life-consuming RPG, a free demo is available on both Steam and consoles.</p>

			<p>Almost two years ago, at the time of writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/">EA and Cliffhanger Games confirmed</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-open-world-game-rumor-ea-studio-shadow-of-morder-vets/">rumors</a> of a new Black Panther game coming from EA were true, and that the team at Cliffhanger was working on a new single-player, third-person action game with Black Panther as the main character.</p>
<p>Today, a new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN</a> revealed that EA has <strong>canceled</strong> its Black Panther game and shut down the studio working on it, Cliffhanger Games. It's the latest batch of layoffs from Electronic Arts after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off 300-400 developers last month</a> and canceled an incubation project at Respawn. It also recently announced that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">sunsetting its remote work policies</a> and moving to push employees back to working in the office.</p>
<p>According to the report, the layoffs extend to members of EA's mobile and central teams, but the company would not share exactly how many developers were impacted. In an email from Laura Miele, EA Entertainment president, she reportedly called the decision, and the other recent layoffs that EA has suffered, "<em>hard</em>" choices, but that they are choices being made to "<em>sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.</em>"</p>
<p>Miele also wrote that the company is doing "<em>everything we can to support them, including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles</em>." She also continues to say that moving forward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">EA's Entertainment division</a> will focus on: The Sims, Skate, Battlefield, and Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Respawn will still work on the upcoming third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-will-be-written-by-squirrel-girl-writer-ryan-north/">Iron Man game from Motive Studio</a> is still happening, though with this cancellation, it's worth not putting too much stock in Miele's reassurances about the Iron Man game, especially when considering what EA's chief executive officer, Andrew Wilson, said last year about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA moving away from games based on licensed IP</a>.</p>

We expect strategies against this monster to be very similar, however, should specific Event Quests return.</p><h2 id="h751424"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is more intense than its weaker variants, the general faults are the same.

An important distinction is that bringing weapons with an ice element as well as armor with high thunder resistance is more of a requirement than a recommendation this time around. We’ll want to end this as soon as possible, especially with the beast’s abundant health and higher resistance to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276">wounds</a></span>.</p><p>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is also far more aggressive than its Tempered variant, attacking more frequently and stringing together many of its moves. It’s a common occurrence to be hit by one attack and then by another while trying to get up. Remember to call your Seikret for a quick pick-up before you get sent back to camp! Your Seikret is the perfect asset that shouldn’t be overlooked during intense hunts like these. Taking a break from the action to heal up is a lot better than doing so within Rey Dau’s proximity.</p><p>What might be the most notable difference is that many of this monster’s attacks will attract lightning strikes. These increase the likelihood of being stunned and make it more difficult to get some hits in. Hunters who enjoy using weapons with counterattacks will need to keep their guard up a bit longer. A successful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> works fine, but other counters will usually be interrupted and leave you defenseless for a more damaging attack. Bringing gear with the Evade Extender skill can be a big help for dodging the lightning as well.</p><p><strong>If you need a break from these aftershocks, destroying the blue Fulgurite crystals along its wings and tail will disable them for around three minutes.</strong> It’s not a permanent solution as the crystals will come back, and you’ll be dealing less damage by not focusing on the head, but this is an ideal tactic if you’re having trouble with these follow-ups.</p><p>Not counting the extra lightning, Arch-Tempered Rey Dau does come with a brand-new move. Standing too close can trigger it to shoot lightning directly beneath it. This is an important attack to be mindful of, since Rey Dau’s underside is a safe spot in previous hunts. Being hit by this will leave you open for a potential follow-up charged beam that can faint you. My advice is to dodge out of the way as soon as you notice it charging up and looking down. You’ll likely have a second at most to react.</p><p>Destroying tempered wounds is still a fantastic way to knock your target down. Coming at odds with this is Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s high wound resistance. Besides a weak spot that appears after performing its strongest charged beam, there aren’t many opportunities to land a focus strike and some nice damage. Knocking Rey Dau down will mostly require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, traps (pitfall and vine traps specifically), and the occasional Flash Pod when it’s flying in the air.</p><p>There isn’t much more to the fight than chasing after it to new locations. The electric wyvern is basically enraged the entire fight, so it’s purely a matter of survival. Always prioritize your health to best avoid any one-hit KOs. If you’ve been carted once or twice already, remember that capturing the monster is an option. No shame in finishing this hunt early.</p><h2 id="h751426"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Exclusive Rewards</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of the rewards and drops you receive will be the same as the Tempered version. <strong>The biggest difference for Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is that instead of receiving </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176"><strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong></a></span><strong>, you’ll receive the new Rey Dau Certificate Y material.</strong> This is needed to forge the new Rey Dau Gamma armor for your hunter and Palico, as well as upgrade to the new Defense Charm V and Power Charm III talismans.

                <p>Electronic Arts has confirmed it's cancelling its upcoming Black Panther game and closing its developer. Cliffhanger Games, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">only opened in 2023 to make the Black Panther game</a>, is now shuttered. EA previously signed a deal with Marvel for multiple games, and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">Iron Man title</a> is still coming.</p><p>EA boss Laura Miele said in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo obtained by IGN</a> that the company is cancelling the game and closing the studio to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502908" data-ratio="0.55793450881612" data-width="1588" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502908"></a><figcaption>EA's Black Panther game is not going forward.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg"></figure><p>Additionally, EA is laying off staff on its mobile and "central" teams, though the exact number of affected staff is unknown. This follows on from a previous round of layoffs in April that affected around 300 people and led to the reported <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">cancellation of a Titanfall game</a>.</p><p>"These decisions are hard," Miele said in a memo to staff. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them-- including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p>In 2024, EA laid off nearly 700 people and said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">wasn't sure how much more it would invest in licensed IP going forward</a>. Due to this commentary, some wondered if any of EA's Marvel projects would be affected. EA previously signed a multi-game deal with Marvel, and now, the only confirmed project from that partnership is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">new Iron Man game from Motive Studio.</a> When the deal was announced, EA said it covered <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-marvel-entertainment-multi-title-collaboration" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at least three games.</a></p><p>Cliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, who oversaw the production of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War at Monolith Productions. He joined EA in 2021. Other members of the team at Cliffhanger worked on Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty.</p><p>It is unknown how far along in development the Black Panther game was. When the game and the studio were announced in 2023, EA said the game was "still in early development with a long road ahead." EA and Cliffhanger were attempting to make what they said was a "definitive and authentic Black Panther experience."</p><p>Outside of EA's superhero games, Warner Bros. was making a Wonder Woman game based on the iconic DC character, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-wonder-woman-legend-was-working-on-canceled-game-offers-heartfelt-tribute/1100-6529718/" data-ref-id="1100-6529718">that game was also canceled.</a></p><p>Going forward, Miele said that EA would focus on Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends, while development will continue on Iron Man and the next Star Wars: Jedi game. EA's mobile game projects remain intact, while BioWare continues to make the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect</a> as well. And of course, EA's sports catalog will continue as well, including EA Sports FC, Madden, College Football, and NHL.</p><p>Despite all of EA's recent layoffs and closures, the company's headcount continues to grow. As of March 2025, EA had <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 800 additional people on staff</a> than it did the same time a year prior.</p><p>EA is making these dramatic cuts and closures as the company rakes in money. For the last three months alone, EA pulled in <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1.9 billion in revenue and made a profit of $254 million</a>. For the latest fiscal year, however, EA's revenue slid from $7.562 billion to $7.463 billion, with net profit falling from $1.273 billion to $1.121 billion. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the core pieces of gameplay in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> is skills--you know, the stuff that your sims are good at. As it is in our world, there are tons of skills that every sim can hypothetically learn over the course of their lives, and every new expansion adds a small pile of new ones. It can be a lot to keep track of; even folks who've been playing The Sims 4 since launch have probably forgotten about some of these. There are more than four dozen skills that adult sims are able to learn at this point, and that's not even counting the many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">Sims 4 mods</a> that add more.</p><p dir="ltr">Every skill in The Sims 4 has related activities that you can do to learn them, but there are also universal methods. There are several aspiration rewards you can take that will make your sim gain skills faster--Night Owl and Morning Sim will increase your skill gains at night and in the morning, respectively, and Savant will give you a 25% boost to all skill gains permanently.</p><p dir="ltr">Every skill also has corresponding skill books you can read to jumpstart your skill gains, though you won't be able to max out any skill just by reading about it--learning theory will only take you so far. Likewise, you can learn skills by taking college classes, or by using a research terminal at a library. But eventually you'll have to practice for real.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502904-thesims4skillsgardening.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502904" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502904-thesims4skillsgardening.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502904"></a><figcaption>Gardening is one of the dozens of skills your sims can learn in The Sims 4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502904-thesims4skillsgardening.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And that's why we're making this list. Below you'll find every single skill in The Sims 4, from vanilla through the most recent expansion, Businesses &amp; Hobbies, along with the unique activities you can do to improve them and the emotional state that's best for each.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a

			<p>The Lonesome Guild is a colorful action RPG where you play as a Ghost trying to bring six animal misfits together to try and save the world from a corrupting mist, and it just got a new gameplay trailer as part of the <a href="https://www.actugaming.net/ag-french-direct/?mc_cid=0f1b47ab9d&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6">AG French Direct 2025</a> event.</p>
<p>While the animals you bring together start off as lonely, they don't end up that way as you build relationships with them and work to recover the memories you lost from your life, now that you're squarely in the afterlife as a ghost.</p>
<p>Fittingly, The Lonesome Guild is all about "<em>fighting</em> <em>loneliness</em>," and the trailer showcases how you and your animal companions work together to use the power of the new friendships you're forging to fight against the large robotic contraptions you'll face on your journey through Etere.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lonesome Guild | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8AHqZlR2vQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If anything about The Lonesome Guild seems like it would be your kind of game, you can test that theory by playing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486450/The_Lonesome_Guild/">demo</a> that publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Don't Nod</a> and developer Tiny Bull Studios just released. Though the full game will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, the demo is only available on PC for now. It's also currently set to arrive on all platforms sometime in Fall 2025, but there's no specific release date as of yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-new-playstation-vr2-deal-finally-make-it-worth-buying<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">PSVR 2 is back down to its all-time low price.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PlayStation VR2 headset has dropped to match its all-time low price thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-sale-2025-live">PlayStation Days of Play sale</a>, so if you've been considering picking one up for yourself, right now would be the time to do so. But the question is: Should you actually buy one in 2025? The PSVR2 originally launched for a whopping $599, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-psvr2-headset-price-cut-deal-is-now-live">Sony dropped the price</a> down to just $399 back in March. The latest discount brings that price all the way down to only $349 for both the stand-alone headset and the Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation VR2 Headset Is On Sale at Amazon Today</h2><div catalogid="f4357a55-1b57-400c-ac5d-2dc92766936f" id="221877"><div id="221877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PSVR 2: Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new $50 discount on the PSVR2 bundle is certainly tempting if you've been wanting to get into VR, but there are a few things to consider before you buy. This is likely the lowest price we'll see on this headset for quite some time and it is the only VR option for PS5 owners. If you want to play Horizon Call of The Mountain, owning a PSVR2 is currently the only way you'll be able to do that. Just last year Sony also released the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-review">PSVR2 PC adapter</a> that allows you to connect it to your PC and play VR games there as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-cuts-investment-in-vr-development-only-two-first-party-vr-games-currently-in-development-report">Sony isn't really investing </a>much into first-party VR games anymore. And with the price drop back in March and the release of the PC adapter, it definitely seems like PS5 owners aren't going to be seeing a slew of new and exciting VR games any time soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is It Worth Buying a PSVR 2 in 2025?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the PSVR 2 is cheaper than the standard Meta Quest 3 <em>and</em> has PC compatibility, it's worth considering if you're looking to get into VR. Since it is really the only VR option for PlayStation, this price definitely makes it worth it if you have both a PS5 and a PC that can handle VR games. You do have to purchase the PC adapter if you want to access your SteamVR library, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-connect-ps-vr2-headset-to-a-pc">connecting to PC is a fairly simple process</a> overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own a PS5 and are just looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-vr-headsets-for-pc">decent VR headset for PC</a>, the PSVR 2 probably isn't worth your money. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> is still cheaper and doesn't require any sort of extra adapter to start playing games. Since the PSVR 2 isn't a standalone VR headset, you'd also be better off going with the Quest 3 if you don't have either a PS5 or a PC to connect to.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 28, 2025 5:55 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It may be tough to believe, but The Sims 4 was out for four entire years without seasons, weather, or holidays. That changed, finally, when the Seasons expansion pack dropped in 2018--and it's been considered the single-most essential expansion for The Sims 4 since. If you're just diving into the worlds of The Sims 4, Seasons is the first pack you need to buy.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's not the most feature-packed expansion in terms of how much stuff there is to do in it, Seasons makes two fundamental additions to the world that we can't imagine living without: dynamic weather, with each world having its own unique climate; and holidays, including the ability to make your own. Let's look closer at the weather first.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Basic_Sims_4_weather_tips">Basic Sims 4 weather tips</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_change_the_weather_in_The_Sims_4">How to change the weather in The Sims 4</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_use_cheats_and_mods_with_Sims_4_weather">How to use cheats and mods with Sims 4 weather</a></li><li><a href="#Sims_4_Worlds_and_Climates">Sims 4 Worlds and Climates</a><ul><li><a href="#Willow_Creek">Willow Creek</a></li><li><a href="#Oasis_Springs">Oasis Springs</a></li><li><a href="#Newcrest">Newcrest</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Magnolia_Promenade">Magnolia Promenade</a></li><li><a href="#Windenberg">Windenberg</a><ul><li><a href="#San_Myshuno">San Myshuno</a></li><li><a href="#Forgotten_Hollow">Forgotten Hollow</a></li><li><a href="#Brindleton_Bay">Brindleton Bay</a></li><li><a href="#Del_Sol_Valley">Del Sol Valley</a></li><li><a href="#StrangerVille">StrangerVille</a></li><li><a href="#Sulani">Sulani</a></li><li><a href="#Glimmerbrook">Glimmerbrook</a></li><li><a href="#Britechester">Britechester</a></li><li><a href="#Evergreen_Harbor">Evergreen Harbor</a></li><li><a href="#Mt__Komorebi">Mt. Komorebi</a></li><li><a href="#Henford_on_Bagley">Henford-on-Bagley</a></li><li><a href="#Tartosa">Tartosa</a></li><li><a href="#Moonwood_Mill">Moonwood Mill</a></li><li><a href="#Copperdale">Copperdale</a></li><li><a href="#San_Sequoia">San Sequoia</a></li><li><a href="#Chestnut_Ridge">Chestnut Ridge</a></li><li><a href="#Tomarang">Tomarang</a></li><li><a href="#Ciudad_Enamora">Ciudad Enamora</a></li><li><a href="#Ravenwood">Ravenwood</a></li><li><a href="#Nordhaven">Nordhaven</a></li><li><a href="#Granite_Falls">Granite Falls</a></li><li><a href="#Selvadorada">Selvadorada</a></li><li><a href="#Batuu">Batuu</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Basic_Sims_4_weather_tips">Basic Sims 4 weather tips</h2><p dir="ltr">The very first thing to keep in mind about weather in The Sims 4 is that it can have extreme consequences if you aren't careful. Extreme hot or cold can kill your sims--they can freeze to death if they don't wear a coat during a blizzard, or they can overheat themselves by exercising too much or hanging out near a fire when it's really hot (I've literally had a sim die because the fireplace was lit in their house during a heat wave). Likewise, if they spend too much time outside during a storm they might get struck by lightning. So be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond dressing and behaving appropriately for the weather, there are lifetime aspiration reward perks you can unlock that will help your sims deal with these effects. There are acclimation perks for hot and cold weather (500 points each) that will allow your sim to feel the effects of the extreme temperatures without being in danger from them, and you can take things all the way with the Heatproof and Iceproof perks (2000 points each) to avoid the issue entirely. The Storm Chaser perk (1000 points), which makes a sim enjoy thunderstorms rather than be scared of them, will actually make your sim more likely to be struck by lightning, but it will simply make them energized when it happens instead of causing any harm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502870-sims4weatherstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502870" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502870-sims4weatherstorms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502870"></a><figcaption>The addition of weather in The Sims 4: Season is a literally game-changer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4502870-sims4weatherstorms.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_change_the_weather_in_The_Sims_4">How to change the weather in The Sims 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, you are not at all at the game's mercy when it comes to weather, as you can change the local weather whenever you want using Dr. June's Weather Control Device, which you can buy for 1500 simoleons in build mode. Once it's placed in your home, just click the device and pick the weather you want.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_cheats_and_mods_with_Sims_4_weather">How to use cheats and mods with Sims 4 weather</h2><p dir="ltr">In a rather unusual twist, there aren't any working weather-related cheats in The Sims 4--there used to be console commands, but they don't work anymore for some reason. But if you're playing The Sims 4 on PC, you can use a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/">Sims 4 mod</a> to restore those cheats. Fortunately, it's a mod you may already have, the immensely popular <a href="https://deaderpool-mccc.com/" rel="nofollow ">MC Command Center</a>, which adds several utilities for granularly controlling your game world. Once you've installed the mod and have it running, you can click on any mailbox, select the MC Cheats option to open the MCCC menu, then select Seasons for all your weather-related choices.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Sims_4_Worlds_and_Climates">Sims 4 Worlds and Climates</h2><p dir="ltr">Just as on the real Earth, each region in The Sims 4 has its own climate and range of temperatures--some places are hot, some places are cold, and some places get the full spectrum of weather. Below is a description of the climate in each Sims 4 world.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Willow_Creek">Willow Creek</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Base game</em></p><p dir="ltr">Willow Creek has a climate that experiences the full range of the seasons, with very hot summers and very cold, snowy winters, with frequent precipitation all year.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Oasis_Springs">Oasis Springs</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Base game</em></p><p dir="ltr">This desert locale is dry year-round, and it never gets cold--watch out for those summer heat waves.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Newcrest">Newcrest</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Base game</em></p><p dir="ltr">A temperate world, Newcrest experiences the full breadth of all four seasons, with warm and rainy summers and cool winters, and a chance of extreme temperatures.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Magnolia_Promenade">Magnolia Promenade</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Get to Work</em></p><p dir="ltr">This commercial area has the same climate as Newcrest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Windenberg">Windenberg</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Get Together</em></p><p dir="ltr">This Europe-inspired region has occasionally hot summers, and snowy, blizzard-filled winters.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="San_Myshuno">San Myshuno</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>City Living</em></p><p dir="ltr">This pastiche of major cities from around the world has a climate similar to New York City--very hot summers, very cold winters, and plenty of precipitation year-round.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Forgotten_Hollow">Forgotten Hollow</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Vampires</em></p><p dir="ltr">This gloomy, sunless region is temperate, with temperatures ranging from hot to cold without usually going into the extremes on either end.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Brindleton_Bay">Brindleton Bay</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Cats &amp; Dogs</em></p><p dir="ltr">The pets region experiences the full range of temperatures and precipitation, but is less likely to get stormy than other regions with that sort of climate.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Del_Sol_Valley">Del Sol Valley</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Get Famous</em></p><p dir="ltr">Based on Los Angeles, Del Sol Valley has a warm, but not hot, climate for most of the year, with moderately cool winters that occasionally bring rain.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="StrangerVille">StrangerVille</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>StrangerVille</em></p><p dir="ltr">This desert region stays hot pretty much year-round, with extremely hot summers in particular, and occasionally gets some rainfall during the warm winters.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sulani">Sulani</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Island Living</em></p><p dir="ltr">This Pacific-inspired region stays warm throughout the year, and is one of the only worlds to experience monsoons, which functionally are just more extreme thunderstorms. But, like Del Sol Valley, it never gets extremely hot.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Glimmerbrook">Glimmerbrook</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Realm of Magic</em></p><p dir="ltr">Glimmerbrook experiences very mild summers, and frosty winters that make this magical area particularly cool to wander around in.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Britechester">Britechester</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Discover University</em></p><p dir="ltr">This college town has a fairly standard climate that experiences all four seasons, with temperate summers and occasionally freezing winters, with precipitation common year-round.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Evergreen_Harbor">Evergreen Harbor</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Eco Lifestyle</em></p><p dir="ltr">Based on cities in the USA's Pacific Northwest like Portland, Evergreen Harbor is a temperate region with warm summers and cool winters--but it rarely experiences extreme temperatures or weather.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Mt__Komorebi">Mt. Komorebi</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Snowy Escape</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's cold and snowy year-round in this mountain town, with frequent blizzards during the winter.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Henford_on_Bagley">Henford-on-Bagley</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Cottage Living</em></p><p dir="ltr">This rural British-style town experiences the weather cycle of all four seasons, including thunderstorms in the summer and snow in the winter, but temperature extremes are very rare.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Tartosa">Tartosa</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>My Wedding Stories</em></p><p dir="ltr">This Mediterranean area is always temperate and rarely has any weather other than general windiness and occasional rainstorms.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Moonwood_Mill">Moonwood Mill</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Werewolves</em></p><p dir="ltr">This Twilight-ish small town is temperate during every season but winter, which brings snowfall and cold temperatures.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Copperdale">Copperdale</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>High School Years</em></p><p dir="ltr">You won't see a significant range of temperatures in this town, but you will see a lot of rain, as Copperdale is one of the stormiest of the worlds of The Sims 4.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="San_Sequoia">San Sequoia</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Growing Together</em></p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4's loose interpretation of the San Francisco Bay Area is warm, but not hot, most of the year, and experiences very mild winters without snow. Rainfall is pretty common year-round, however.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Chestnut_Ridge">Chestnut Ridge</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Horse Ranch</em></p><p dir="ltr">This desert-style region experiences mild temperatures year round, with occasional snowfall in the winter and rain the rest of the year.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Tomarang">Tomarang</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>For Rent</em></p><p dir="ltr">This tropical region is usually hot and frequently rainy--and, like Sulani, it can experience monsoons. Even in the winter it won't get cold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ciudad_Enamora">Ciudad Enamora</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Lovestruck</em></p><p dir="ltr">Very similar climate to Tomarang, including the possibility of monsoons.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ravenwood">Ravenwood</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Life and Death</em></p><p dir="ltr">There's not much in the way of weather in Ravenwood, where it never gets particularly hot or cold and precipitation is rare.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nordhaven">Nordhaven</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Businesses &amp; Hobbies</em></p><p dir="ltr">This world experiences the full cycle of seasonal changes, but summers are mild and winters are decidedly not, with snow and freezing temperatures fairly common.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Granite_Falls">Granite Falls</h3><p dir="ltr"><em>Outdoor Retreat</em></p><p dir="ltr">This forest world is a rare area that has it all, from the hottest summers to the coldest winters.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has launched a new crowdfunding campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>. The aptly named <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 campaign introduces expanded player options for the studio's fantasy TTRPG, including new subclasses and spells.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/players-guide-2-new-power-for-5e-and-tov-players/description" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter page</a>, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 offers players more customization options for their characters. This includes over 40 subclasses for pre-existing classes alongside three new classes: the Vanguard, Witch, and Theurge.

And in <em>Last Epoch</em>, it can take a player anywhere from 25 to 50 hours to fully delve into all of the game’s mechanics and reach the endgame. For that journey, you’re likely to stick with a single class instead of swapping between characters. For Season Two—Tombs of the Erased—I decided to forego my usual spellcaster for something different, the Sentinel. I’m not disappointed in the least bit.

It’s an open-world craft-heavy RPG in which you charge around an alien planet, beating up the local flora and fauna, in order to gather their parts to build more effective means of beating up the local flora and fauna. Along the way, there’s the most astonishingly intricate storyline, a vast cast of bonkers characters, and a kerjillion (I counted) items to craft.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>OK, so not much about the above perhaps sounds fantastically original, and sure, I get that. But what makes <em>Crashlands</em> and its recent sequel stand out from the crowd is that it plays like an action-RPG. Combat is very lively, all about getting in a hit, dashing and rolling, throwing in a bomb, mixing up ranged and melee combat, and all from a comfortable isometric view.</p><p>Each enemy type, of which there are approximately infinity, requires a unique tactic, often with two or three of them getting mixed up in a brawl at the same time. That latter situation is the best, because they all want to fight each other as much as they want to kill you, so luring them toward each other can create a splendid showdown, with you lobbing in explosives from the sidelines. There’s rarely a moment when you aren’t whacking at something, whether it’s rocks, plants or vicious creatures, usually while running to your next quest or destination.</p><p>I really encourage you to play both games, but I’m focusing on <em>Crashlands 2</em> today because it came out just last month, and it’s occupied so many of my evenings and spare moments that it just feels silly not to share that with you. It’s one of those games I’m playing purely for pleasure, looking forward to after a busy day of playing other games, and not even thinking about how I could turn it into work (even though I now accidentally have). I’ve accidentally stayed up far too late far too many nights over the last couple of weeks, thinking I’ll just get another couple of quests ticked off, get the ingredients for the next dagger upgrade, and see about clearing out that one robot base, and then discovering it’s somehow&nbsp;2 a.m. and I have the school run in the morning.</p><p>You play as Flux Dabes, an intergalactic trucker who has been screwed over by her corporation, and finds herself (in both games) dumped on an alien planet—Woanope—without the means to leave. She’s once again accompanied by Juicebox, a floating, um, robotic juice carton, who provides color commentary and endless wry remarks, and the two become intricately involved in the lives of the local intelligent lifeforms and their battle against the same corporation you’ve recently quit.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s more extraordinary than anything else about these games is their <em>size</em>. They are so, <em>so</em> big. As you play, your explorable area endlessly grows, gated by the strength of more distant enemies and occasionally by the need to develop means of traveling that you’ve yet to craft. In <em>Crashlands 2</em>, you also build a little home for yourself and your inventive companions packed with research benches for them to work at, where they tirelessly dream up new devices, weapons, nets, bombs, fertilizers, staffs, fishing rods, helmets, wall types, baits, armors, and pieces of decor for you to craft from the billions of items that drop when you hit stuff. Plentiful teleporters mean the ever-growing scale doesn’t become too daunting, and the constant sense of progress is unrelentingly rewarding.</p><p>I really cannot express to you how large this game is. I remember in 2016's <em>Crashlands</em>, thinking I was about to end the game, before discovering I had only explored one landscape out of two. Something similar happened in the sequel, when after a packed 15 hours or so of playing I was wrapping up the storyline, defeating a tougher boss, and thinking I was about to roll credits, only to discover it was teasing me, I wasn’t even halfway. And, crucially, I was delighted! I wasn’t ready for it to be over.</p><figure id="" data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think a large part of why I didn’t want it to be done, even though I’d gone through a satisfying arc that’d be easily worth the entry fee, is because of the game’s constant positive feedback loop. You’re <em>always </em>progressing, always ticking off something from one of its many lists, and each time experiencing a meaningful difference. Beefing up your knuckles weapon, and then equipping it with a bunch of trinkets and buffs that complement it, means thwacking a tricky enemy is going to be much easier. Boosting your HP with new armor makes you feel so much tougher. Crafting a new workbench suddenly opens up your opportunities in multiple directions.  More means more fantastically animated enemy types, more silly story, more quests to complete, more locations to uncover, more boxes to tick and items to craft and progress progress progress.</p><p>Flaws? Well, weirdly—given how much love is poured into it—I would say the writing. It’s really good! It’s just that there’s far too much of it. Conversations to get a new quest can end up going on for 20, 30 exchanges of speech-bubble text, and while it’s all superbly written and often very funny, I find myself frustrated by just wanting to know what I’m supposed to be doing next. I have, I confess, committed the cardinal sin of clicking through it all and then just checking the quest log. I don’t want to! But honestly, <em>Crashlands 2 </em>is so  wildly overwritten. It needed a detached, heartless editor to cut swathes from it, keep the great gags, and get to the point. </p><p>But&nbsp;when that’s my major complaint about such a detailed and expansive game, you know it must be doing an awful lot right. And all of this in a paid-for game that has no in-app purchases or extra fees. These games could be monetized to utter misery, and instead they don’t even dip a toe in that mire.</p><figure id="" data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This does make <em>Crashlands 2</em> that most unusual of games: a mobile app that costs money up front. There’s a PC version too, and it’s splendid, but it’s pricier at $25. (And totally worth it. There’s at least 35 hours of game here!) The iOS/Android version is $10, despite being the same game, and while that discrepancy always feels odd, it’s important to note that mobile prices <em>are</em> just a different market: choosing to charge customers at the point of purchase, rather than exploit them ever-after, can be devastating for attention. As such, rather than the million-plus downloads a game like this would get if it were “free-to-play,” it currently sports “5K+” downloads on Android. I really want to express how this is worth every penny, for me one of the most essential games on my tablet, and how important it is to support excellent games that use non-exploitative payments.</p><p>I really don’t know why this isn’t on Xbox or PS5. It’d be the perfect couch game, absorbing your late evening hours, perfectly paired with a light-hearted podcast.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-of-atlan-launches-may-28-and-shakes-up-mmorpg-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal of Atlan is an action MMORPG from developer VI-Games that wants to put its own unique spin on the gameplay of the genre. It features a focus on class-based build diversity, fast-paced aerial combat, and chaining together abilities to build up your combo meter. It's available to <a href="https://coau.onelink.me/Kb3c/rqg5e02q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">download for free</a> right now, but if you're looking for more info before you dive in, we've got you. Let’s start with the classes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Diverse Class Paths for Personalized Builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five base classes available at launch, all unlocked for free at the start of the game: the melee damage dealing Swordsman, ranged attacker Musketeer, magical Magister, martial artist Fighter, and summoner Puppeteer. Each class branches into specialized subclasses, with a total of 11 subclass options and more than 20 unique abilities to experiment with and tailor to your preferred style.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-1-1747937274930.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Swordsman branches into the Magiblade or Berserker. They’re both melee damage dealers, but the Magiblade adds magical abilities (which you could probably guess from the name), and the Berserker can sacrifice health to generate shields and increase power as you get closer to death. Regardless of the subclass you choose, each of the skills you unlock have individual cooldowns. You can mix and match those skills at any time, letting you come up with unique character builds and find skills that chain together well to build combos.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-puppeteer-subclass-1747937366873.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Seamless Ground-to-Air Combat Innovation</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditional MMO combat focuses on ground-based attacks with a fairly simple stand-and-attack style. Crystal of Atlan differentiates itself by including a heavy focus on the Z-axis, introducing a system that encourages you to seamlessly transition between ground and aerial combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-platforming-1747937405449.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can attack and dodge in mid-air, allowing you to pull off aerial combos and adding a new dimension to each battle and a level of responsiveness to moment-to-moment gameplay. You can jump to avoid attacks, then chain that into aerial combos to keep the pressure on enemies. So you’re rewarded for staying on your toes, reacting quickly, and using all your abilities to fluidly chain attacks together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That focus on ground and air combos also informs the design of Crystal of Atlan’s varied environments. All of the game’s maps, from the fantastical Wonderland to the mechanical Chrome Military Factory, have an open 3D layout to allow freedom of movement. Couple that with smooth animations and you get a combat system that’s fluid and fast-paced.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-2-1747937438520.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cooperative Challenges and Social Progression</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect from an MMO, there are a variety of dungeons you can tackle with other players. You fight through packs of normal enemies before getting to the end and facing off against a boss with unique mechanics. That’s all pretty standard, but Crystal of Atlan mixes things up by requiring synchronized team coordination.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-3-1747937464007.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are numerous dungeons with interaction-based mechanics that require teamwork to solve problems. Naturally, if your whole group is tackling such a dungeon for the first time, you’ll need to communicate and help each other figure out what to do. Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, you can take on a mentor role in future runs, but everyone will always need to work together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a fleet system, which is basically like guilds you’ve probably experienced in other games. It’s a key part of Crystal of Atlan's social ecosystem, allowing you to link up with friends to tackle co-op gameplay together or just hang out and chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Competitive PvP and Creative PvE Challenges</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re the competitive type, there are also options for PvP combat. There are 1v1 and 3v3 battles, with attributes, skill damage, and skill cooldowns balanced so there’s no competitive advantage. It’s all about skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Crystal of Atlan is an MMO at heart, it has plenty of content for solo players too. In classic MMO style, there are hub areas where you can see lots of other players. These areas are where you’ll find quests to complete and new zones to explore.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-magiblade-subclass-1747937517467.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventure Mode takes you through the game’s main story, which unlocks in stages. You can tackle these stages solo, and they have a variety of different goals. Some will be focused on combat, where you need to defeat groups of enemies or take on a boss. Others introduce new elements, like requiring you to use stealth to sneak past enemies or use platforming to progress through the area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other modes you can tackle solo or co-op. The main one is the Arena, where you can fight alone or with a partner and gradually work your way up through tiers of opponents, earning escalating rewards as you do. If you manage to get through all the tiers, you can reach the Finals for the ultimate reward.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-4-1747937545618.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To sum it all up, Crystal of Atlan is an MMORPG that mixes together classic staples of the genre with evolved gameplay to keep things fun, fast, and fluid. It launches May 28 on PC, PS5, iOS, and Android, with crossplay across all platforms. The PS5 version has an optimized HUD layout to avoid clutter and utilizes the haptic feedback of the DualSense controller. It also has a remapped UI for controller input, using a function wheel you’re probably familiar with from other games. There’s HDR support for enhanced lighting, and PSSR is enabled on the PS5 Pro for sharper visuals and more stable frame rates.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/21/crystal-of-atlan-ps5-command-wheel-1747849581064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info on the world, classes, and features of Crystal of Atlan, you can check out <a href="https://coa.nvsgames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">the official website</a>.

In a <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?si=edC8QP_C_CzmTl5N" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 2023 interview with IGN</a>, Bethesda development chief Todd Howard said Skyrim had sold over 60 million copies. So, we now have a potential tie for the best-selling role-playing game of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt launched in May 2015, and recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary. Here’s Adam Badowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, on The Witcher 3 sales milestone:</p><blockquote>Without a doubt, the third part of Geralt’s adventures marks a pivotal point in our history. The game earned hundreds of awards and solidified our studio’s standing, but more importantly, it brought untold hours of adventures and emotions to millions of games the world over. I am proud to announce that since its release The Witcher 3 has sold over 60 million copies, securing a place among the bestselling video games in all history, and motivating us to carry on with intensive work on the next trilogy set in this universe.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to The Witcher 4, which is currently in full production. 422 out of 730 developers at CD Projekt are working on the sequel, which won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke">hit back at criticism of <u>The Witcher 4</u> focusing on Ciri</a> — and told so-called fans of the franchise to "read the damn books."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's just stupid," Cockle said of the backlash against The Witcher 4, sparked due to it featuring Ciri as its protagonist for the first time instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not woke," Cockle continued, speaking during a video published by <a href="https://youtu.be/Ufg-mhMsR7o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fall Damage</u></a>. "There's nothing woke about it.

"I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They, presumably, are Atlus, though the company has yet to officially confirm a Persona 4 remake is in the works. We have reached out to Sega/Atlus for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game actors under SAG-AFTRA are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">still on strike</a> over issues including AI protections. While Lowenthal is a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1r-wDSLqp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAG-AFTRA member</a>, it's unclear whether that played a part in casting. However, the organization continues to press for protections for its actors, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-its-still-frustratingly-far-apart-from-games-industry-bargaining-group-on-ai-protections">a March statement saying</a> they are still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite any official confirmation, rumors have swirled around a potential Persona 4 remake for a while. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake">domain discovery earlier this year sparked hopes</a> that a P4 remake is in the oven, and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/persona-4-remake-reportedly-in-development-reliable-sega-leaker-wait-a-while/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leakers have teased</a> the existence of a remake before that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, with all that said, a former voice actor confirming the remake is certainly not how most would imagine this information would get out there.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Cyberpunk 2 has officially entered pre-production, developer CD Projekt has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio made the announcement as part of its latest financial results, where it said the Phantom Liberty expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 had hit an impressive 10 million copies sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">96 of CD Projekt’s 730 developers are now working on Cyberpunk 2, it added. The majority of the staff (422) is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>, which is in full production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Several weeks ago the CD Projekt Red team responsible for the next big game set in the Cyberpunk universe completed the project’s conceptual phase," CD Projekt said. "As a result, Cyberpunk 2 – previously known under the codename Project Orion – has progressed to pre-production."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is pre-production ? In the world of AAA development, pre-production can involve everything from fleshing out concepts to planning full production, building prototypes to staffing up studios. It can often take years to complete.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an investor call following the release of the company's financial report, CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski responded to the suggestion Cyberpunk 2 won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031, and Nowakowski failed to rule that release window out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can reiterate in a way what I said in one of the previous calls, which was basically that our journey from pre-production to final release takes four to five years on average," Nowakowski said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having said that, keep in mind that each project is unique, and there are many variables that influence the final outcome. So I will not lead you into specific years, but yes, this is pretty much how it looks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2 still sounds a long way off, then. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest">so does The Witcher 4</a>. But we at least now know what CD Projekt is calling the game, after it was referred to previously as its codename, Orion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know next to nothing about Cyberpunk 2, but earlier this month <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases">Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</a>. Pondsmith, who worked closely with CD Projekt on the 30 million-selling Cyberpunk 2077 and was involved in promoting the game ahead of its 2020 launch, was asked about the scope of his involvement with Orion at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding, Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’ "</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/gsc9ih5xeaag1w8-1748448149834.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">96 developers at CD Projekt are working on Cyberpunk 2. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the <em>feel</em> of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also already some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable. There are a lot of unknowns, but it looks like there may be two fleshed out playable cities in this sequel at the very least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely busy time for CD Projekt, of course. There’s a new Cyberpunk animation project on Netflix following the well-received Cyberpunk: Edgerunners in the works. In the shorter term, Cyberpunk 2077 is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <title><![CDATA[The Handmaid’s Tale Is Finally Over, Except It Isn’t]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/handmaids-tale-finale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-handmaid%E2%80%99s-tale-is-finally-over-except-it-isn%E2%80%99t.1200885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/handmaids-tale-finale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The series finale of Hulu’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> aired last night, finally putting the Elisabeth Moss-fronted adaptation of Maragret Atwood’s novel out of its misery after six seasons. When the show first started in 2017, it felt chillingly appropriate for the horrors of the first Trump administration; the finale felt appropriate not to the second Trump administration, but to our current age of franchises.</p><p><strong>(Spoilers for </strong><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong><strong> finale and previous seasons.)</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Handmaid's Tale | Final Season Trailer | Hulu" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBBRUdLBsFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’ll sum up how we got to the finale by quoting from what I wrote in our newsletter in mid-April:</p><blockquote><p>…over the seasons, especially as the show moved away from its setting of Gilead, I think it lost what made it powerful. In my mind, one of the biggest problems is that, despite being set in a world with such clear power structures and such high stakes, there are few consequences for any of its main characters. Protagonist June does more and more rebellious and ostentatious acts, but nothing ever <em>happens </em>to her; she is somehow immune to Gilead's power in ways that became less about her own resolve or resourcefulness and more, it felt, about the show needing to just not kill off Elisabeth Moss' character. This made the show grow repetitive and toothless.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>While earlier seasons felt like they deftly showcased Gilead’s might and the ways people were able to claim their power in its cracks, by the end of the series June was traipsing back and forth across the border with impunity. Gilead felt like it lost its threat, even for the people who still lived there. In the finale, this lack of consequences extends to other characters: Janine is captured by Gilead in the previous episode, but we worry about her fate for about 20 minutes before she’s released. The long-running conflict between Janine and Naomi, who has Janine’s daughter, is hastily resolved by Naomi just giving Janine the child back, with no time spent on what happens to Naomi now that she’s two times a widow in a failing empire. Aunt Lydia, who was facing death after denouncing Gilead in the previous episode, is somehow not just fine but back in power.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of plotlines for the finale to wrap up, but instead it eats up much of its hour runtime with flashbacks to June’s pre-Gilead life with daughter Hannah and with a mortifying fantasy sequence where June and all the women she’s met sing karaoke together. It then has to rush through its actual story, giving us passionless conversations between June and the people in her life. June forgives Serena Joy, drawing on a heavy-handed religiosity that got hammered into season six (“maybe the good guys can also have religion” is an idea I would definitely be here for, but the show mostly employs it for zingers in conversation rather than exploring the idea with any depth.). June and Luke break up, sort of maybe. June’s mother and her daughter arrive from Alaska (on… busses? Through a warzone?) only for June to immediately leave again, in pursuit of Hannah who has conveniently been moved from Colorado to DC.&nbsp;</p><p>All this feels like setup for the TV adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Testaments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Testaments</em></a>, Atwood’s 2019 sequel. That show’s creators say it takes place <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/05/27/the-testaments-tv-show-the-handmaids-tale/83727966007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15 years</a> after <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, but its narrative centers around life in an oppressive, post-June Gilead that still has teeth, putting it in conflict with the timeline <em>The Handmaid’s Tale </em>pursued once it ran out of book to adapt. It needs the door to be left open on several of <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>’s characters–Aunt Lydia, June and Nick’s daughter Nicole, Luke and June’s daughter Hannah–, some of whom have to be older but still under Gilead’s thumb. So <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> has to leave some of its biggest questions unresolved, something I would have found acceptable if the show had leaned into subtlety in the rest of its plotting. But the show got so uncomfortable with ambiguity over the seasons that the finale just felt like its creators trying to have things both ways, slamming the book closed on some stories while leaving others open.</p><p>The worst thing I think <em>The Testaments</em> adaption could do is bring June back into it (the creators have been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-handmaids-tale-series-finale-june-hannah-ending-explained-1236229967/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vague</a> on if she’ll appear.). So much of what I feel went wrong with <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> was its focus on making June more and more powerful– I <em>lost it</em> this season when June, <em>the most famous woman in the world</em>, managed to go unrecognized in Gilead while disguised as a handmaid, <em>the outfit everyone recognizes her in</em>. For me, the most interesting part of the show was Gilead itself, what it believed and how it functioned, how different people would find meaning in its oppressive structures and their different relationships to it. Returning the focus to Gilead is a good move for <em>The Testaments</em>, not just because I am a sucker for any media about weird religions, but because that’s where <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>’s strongest tensions and most interesting stories came from. But June as a character should have died seasons ago (she almost does in the penultimate episode of season six, but only for about five minutes before we’re done with that!); the show’s handling of her has dragged the whole series down. And while we badly do not need more <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>–the show got itself into this mess by refusing to end, running out of things to do but nevertheless persisting–if we <em>must</em>, the best thing it can do is tell stories without June in the mix.</p><p>If this is the end of June’s story, it ends in the most embarrassing way possible. Throughout the finale, characters tell June she should write a book. For the show’s narrative, this makes no sense: Surely her escape from Gilead was a global news story; the world knows what happened to her when she testified at the Waterfords’ Canadian trial in season four; and even the argument that she needs to tell the stories of the other handmaids is unnecessary given all the letters that Mayday snuck to Luke in season two, which caused an international incident. Mentions of a book feel like the most unsubtle reminder that <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> was a book in the first place, and that tale itself was a manuscript smuggled out of Gilead. But of course June has no need for smuggling and illicit written words at this point, making the existence of such a book even more powerless. Like so much of the show, there is nothing a book by June needs to do, nothing for it to say that hasn’t already been said.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time the idea of June writing a book came up, I texted a friend who was slightly ahead of me in the episode that if the show ended with June signing copies of <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> at some bookstore full of women I would fully lose my mind. Luckily, it doesn’t do that, instead ending with June in her burnt-out room in the Waterfords’ home, dictating the voiceover that began the series. This was clearly meant to be some kind of triumphant full circle moment, but it fell flat for me given how far the show has moved from the Waterfords’ house and how fully June has since vanquished them. Like the destroyed house itself, there’s nothing left here for any of the show’s characters, no catharsis or emotion left to wring out. Even the ostensibly rebellious act of writing a book other women in Gilead might read has no power given that women were allowed to read in the liberal enclave of New Bethlehem (What was life like there? What happened to it?), making a book's existence in an unchanged Gilead a minor fact of its history. I can already imagine a plotline in <em>The Testaments</em> where women pass a copy of June’s book around, but given everything she’s done in <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, such a thing would land more like sharing a news story than some triumph of the human spirit.</p><p>I feel a bit for <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>’s creators and the many corners they wrote themselves into; I’m not sure how I would have extricated myself in a way that would please audiences and whatever demands Hulu made on the production. The best way for the show to end would have been for it to <em>end</em>, except it isn’t. Despite spending a whole blog railing against the show, I know I won’t be able to keep myself from watching <em>The Testaments</em> whenever it ultimately airs. Here’s hoping the show’s creators use it to learn from <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>'s fumbles.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is launching on 16th October 2025 for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, The Pokémon Company has announced.</p>
<p>The company also confirms that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> Switch 2 Edition, which brings improved graphics and frame rates, will be available as a higher priced version of the game. Those who buy the Nintendo Switch version of the game, both digital or physical, will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition. Curiously, it seems that the Switch 2 version is compatible to Switch, which I’m not 100% sure how this will work with the physical edition.</p>


<p>Here’s TPC’s specific wording:</p>
<p><em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the Nintendo Switch 2 title Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be available. With the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you can enjoy improved graphics and frame rates.</em></p>
<p><em>If you own the Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, you can upgrade it to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition by purchasing an upgrade pack, whether you own the digital version or the physical version of the software. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch system. When playing the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on Nintendo Switch, the content will be the same as that of the Nintendo Switch software. Additional content that utilizes the specs of Nintendo Switch 2 will not be included.</em></p>

<p>No pricing details have been announced at this time, but paid upgrades of this scope – namely Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom – have had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a £8 / $10 price difference</a>.</p>
<p>The second Legends spin-off after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Arceus</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A takes us back to Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y. The city is undergoing a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. This means there’s Wild Zones within the city where Pokémon are allowed to thrive behind locked gates… until pesky trainers of a high enough level stomp in and start chucking Poké Balls at everything that moves and fighting them!</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple.
