            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s Game Awards day, when many of us stay up far too late watching an overly-long awards show that every so often remembers it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed to be an awards show</a>. Yesterday, IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine asked what marks the difference between a Game Awards ad and a Game Awards trailer, and now I’m bringing that question to you.</p><p>“Whenever TGAs are on, there are some trailers where everyone is like ‘oh yeah, trailer!’ and others where everyone goes ‘ew commercial’ and tunes out. Setting aside the fact that they are all, yes, technically commercials, what exactly is the differentiator for people in an event like this? “ Valentine asked on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2qnxjdis2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>. I said this was an interesting question and should be a blog, but since I’m not the editor of every games journalist out there and cannot in fact assign them blogs, she replied that<em> </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2r6pn2vk2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I </em>should blog it</a> instead. So here we are.</p><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld2r5e2e222d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posited</a> that one difference is whether a video is about a game that’s already out (ad) or one that’s upcoming (trailer). <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamoosi.bsky.social/post/3ld2spy6du22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lots</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ld2qst46qk2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sporkyreeve.bsky.social/post/3ld2sujbtnk2j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vitzpatel.bsky.social/post/3ld2srxvgtc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> in Valentine’s replies shared this sentiment. I also suggested it had to do with the presentation of the video–whether Geoff says “world premiere” or someone who made the game introduces it, or whether it just plays in a string of videos about computers and <em>Fortnite</em> battle passes. This, too, was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ld2roizrbc2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markmedina.bsky.social/post/3ld2rrgpwoc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/michaelroleary.bsky.social/post/3ld2sd4xnq22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentiment</a>.</p><p>Other folks said it was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianaltano.bsky.social/post/3ld2ta7bmfk25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> or the sense of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antoinebordeleau.bsky.social/post/3ld2r34ajrc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artistry</a> behind the trailer; there’s a narrative to a trailer, or a purpose beyond just telling you something exists to buy. But of course, one purpose of <em>every</em> trailer is telling you that there’s something you can buy, though that thing might not exist yet. And, of course, there can also be an artistry to ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>More than <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heathercoles.bsky.social/post/3ld2sen6slk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ejsponge61.bsky.social/post/3ld2rtcwmxs2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">person</a> said something along the lines of “if I like it, it’s a trailer,” which I find to be an accurate and refreshing bit of honesty. I’d guess the only people who want to get excited about ads are, well, people who make ads. And since the trailers are the “events” of The Game Awards, turning the thing you’re excited about into a “trailer” and thus an “event” can make it feel like you watched a “good” Game Awards where a lot of things happened, instead of a show stuffed with ads.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I'm partial to this line of reasoning: One of the weird things about The Game Awards, at least from the perspective of someone who's had to cover it, is that it's something that's happening where not a lot of things actually <em>happen</em>. Barring the semi-regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23501270/elden-ring-goty-stage-rushed-bill-clinton-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage-intruding</a> and the occasional excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">musical performance</a>, what <em>are</em> The Game Awards as an event? Is delineating between an ad and a trailer a way to assert narrative and agency into the formless swirl of forced hype that defines the event? (Barring the obvious option that you simply <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not have to watch it</a> at all.) Is the search for trailers humankind's deeper search for structure and meaning? </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to turn Geoff’s Day of Hype into a philosophical exercise, so weigh in in the comments. I wrote the blog. I hope you’re happy, Reb.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket is getting a brand new expansion on December 17th, and it is called Mythical Island. The major addition is a brand new booster pack that will add 80 new cards to the game, including new trainers, new EX cards, and new immersive cards. The trailer for the Mythical Island pack shows those cards and some of their abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island  | Coming Soon!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUYHC2ReohA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mew is the cover Pokemon for this pack, and there will be a Mew EX card. This card has Psyshot as the basic attack, and Genome Hacking will allows Mew to use the attack of the opponent’s active Pokemon. There is also going to be an Aerodactyl Ex which has an ability to prevent opponents evolving their cards. It also has an 80 damage land crush attack. Some new cards that are spotted in the trailer include a Vaporeon art card, a Dedenne art card, Marshadow art card, Dhelmise, Morelull, a new Magmar,&nbsp; a new Tauros card, a new Exeggute card, and new trainer Blue that reduces incoming damage by 10 points.</p>
<p>There will be a lot more cards, so it is best to start saving up those hourglasses to tear open a whole load of packs in one go. Last month, the development team confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/pokemon-pocket-update-new-booster-packs-limited-trading-january/">new booster packs soon would be coming soon, and limited trading would arrive in January</a>. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>

There are a ton of things it changes, but some of the highlights are nerfs to Afterimage and instant Sparking mode skills, DP fights have capped health bar regeneration when a fighter is on standby, and 1v1 local multiplayer now lets you select from any stage, not just the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. </p><p>The Afterimage nerf is a big one. The skill doesn’t last as long now and is cancelled out if your opponent uses Perception. Whereas before it resulted in drawn out dodge battles, it’s now easier to counter. The instant Sparking mode is another major change: the new, increased Skill Count needed to deploy them means players are less likely to be able to spam Sparking mode back-to-back-to-back. DP battles where players go in with a roster of fighters should also move more quickly and smoothly since the recovery rate for constantly swapping them has been reduced (RIP to my OG Z warrior team that eked out wins by constantly tagging in and out). </p><p>The surprise update has so far been met with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near-universal praise on the the subreddit</a></span> where just days prior the community was apoplectic about the state of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and its future prospects for keeping fans engaged. Things reached an especially low point recently after an official tournament organized by Bandai Namco revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/11/official-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tournament-is-an-unsurprising-and-unmitigated-disaster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/11/official-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tournament-is-an-unsurprising-and-unmitigated-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just how busted the game was in a competitive setting</a></span>, with top players getting into vertical flying standoffs and cheesing other exploits. The results were incredibly faithful to the franchise, but a poor display for a game in 2024 whose main ongoing draw is its ranked mode. </p><p>The doom and gloom metastasized in part because Bandai Namco was tightlipped about <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s roadmap, with no real indication of what feedback it was monitoring or when players could expect fixes. After all the radio silence then, this week’s big update caught many fans by surprise. It turns out <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>will continue to get fixes, even if they don’t necessarily come at a clip players might expect from other bigger name fighting games like<em> Street Fighter VI</em> and<em> Tekken 8</em>.<br></p><p>Of course, there’s still more work to be done. Ranked mode remains far from balanced, and players have already spotted some pretty major bugs, like one apparent issue that lets players restore extra health to standby fighters in the last minute of a match. And <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s single-player content remains shallow and disappointing. It seems possible Bandai Namco could continue adding to that part of the game as well, though likely not for free. There’s already a big slate of paid DLC planned. </p><p>For now, though, fans can enjoy a new honeymoon phase with latest <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, including as they pick through the update for all of the possible stealth changes that aren’t even mentioned, like maybe making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Saiyan 3 Goku’s arms a bit bigger</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Steam blog points out that circumstances are different for everyone, especially if they have bandwidth limits each month.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Steam also allows for making specific game exceptions. For example, maybe you're currently playing Path of Exile 2 daily. Steam will let you choose to download any updates for the action-RPG immediately, so it's always ready to go when you have time to play. Meanwhile, maybe you go back to Stardew Valley from time to time. For that cozier experience, Steam users can select to only get updates once it's launched in the client.</p><p dir="ltr">These new options are found under downloads for Steam, according to Valve.

            <p>The anonymous solo developer behind hit poker roguelike Balatro said there's a part of him that regrets the game's success, as he misses when creating games was just a hobby.</p>
<p>LocalThunk, as he's known, wishes to remain anonymous even with the enormous success of the game - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">mobile release alone has reportedly made almost $4.4m</a>.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">GQ</a> if he regrets Balatro's success, he replied: "Honestly, yeah. Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p>

<p>The developer said he treated game creation as a hobby, but the success of Balatro had brought him a huge amount of attention. He even admitted he could retire after this game alone and just make games for fun.</p>
<p>"This last year has been by far the most stressful year of my life," LocalThunk said. "These days I try and think about, what will get me back to where I was when I was making this - when it was relaxing as a hobby. I want to return there."</p><p>He continued: "If I were to make another game after Balatro, which I'm not really thinking about right now, it would be really cathartic to make it and not show anyone. Put it in a folder on my desktop and leave it there. Just for me."</p>
<p>Still, LocalThunk said he planned to continue updating the game in 2025 and had "a lot of fun ideas for directions" to take Balatro, more than just one update's worth, though he doesn't know how many he'll be able to implement.</p>
<p>More jokers are definite though, as he hasn't added any since the game's release.</p>
<p>Balatro is nominated for the big award at tonight's The Game Awards. It's even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">part of the latest Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as a secret quest in collaboration with CD Projekt Red.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fortnite OG has now launched as a separate game type for players to enjoy, and it comes with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">own game pass</a> as well, allowing players to get rewards that they can utilize in Fortnite OG. Within just 20 minutes of the game's release, it managed to get over<a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 1.1 million concurrent players</a>, with this statistic including the OG Zero Build game. This a huge deal for Fortnite, especially after they broke their record for most concurrent users just days before, with 14 million players playing Fortnite on November 30 for the Remix Finale event. Many gamers believe that Battle Royals, including Fortnite, aren't as popular as they used to be. However, Fortnite has seen some groundbreaking statistics for the genre, and the game saw 30 million active users a day during the entirety of 2024.</p>
<p>Fortnite first launched in 2017 and helped the Battle Royale genre skyrocket to new levels of popularity. This game was initially seen as an alternative to PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, which was also launched that year. Compared to PUBG, Fortnite was entirely free-to-play, with the option to purchase cosmetic items such as skins and bling.</p>
<p>While there are many different reasons why Fortnite continues to remain popular today, a lot of it comes from the massive names they've seen collaborate with the game. The game has seen live events and concerts, such as those of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and even Ariana Grande. While these types of events do sound somewhat like a fever dream, they always have a massive turnaround and bring new players to the game.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Fortnite Remix Finale event took place on November 30, where performers such as Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Ice Spice participated. Snoop Dogg even provided a performance of "Another Part of Me (feat. Sting)" for the event. Admittedly, numbers did drop significantly after the event finished, but Fortnite continues to be incredibly popular, even after seven years of being active.</p>
<p>A lot of the popular events in the game revolve around the OG content, with a lot of the events being temporary maps that players can enjoy for a limited time. However, December 6 saw Fortnite OG be added to the game as a separate game type, now providing players with even more choices as to what experience they play in Fortnite.</p>
<p>Players who want to participate in Fortnite OG will get the choice between the original experience, which includes loot, locations, and features from the original experience. Alternatively, they can play OG Zero Build mode, which means players don't have to farm materials and build structures to survive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-next-payday-game-is-a-roblox-fan-creation-that-already-existed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Payday developer and publisher Starbreeze has officially sanctioned Notoriety, a popular heist shooter in Roblox, that previously existed as a Payday-inspired fan game.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/21532277/Notoriety-A-PAYDAY-Experience-READ-DESC#!/about">Notoriety</a> will now be relaunched within Roblox as Notoriety: A Payday Experience and feature "authentic Payday assets, characters and heists". 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the terms of this deal involve for both Starbreeze and Notoriety's development teams, though Notoriety is a hugely popular - and lucrative - Roblox experience, with more than 227m visits and 1.3m favourites from players on the platform.
</p>
<p>
"Notoriety was born out of a love for heist games, with Payday serving as a key source of inspiration," Notoriety developer Evan Pickett said in a Starbreeze press release today. "This official licensing partnership allows us to stay true to our vision while incorporating elements that fans of both Notoriety and Payday will recognise and enjoy."

</figure>
<p>
For its part, Starbreeze said it "deeply admire[s] the skill, passion, and creativity that Evan has poured into crafting Notoriety" and that licensing Payday out opened up the Payday universe to "a fresh perspective". Hey, 227m visits means a lot of eyes on the Payday franchise. 
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> launched back in October 2023 and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">struggled to capture the same level of interest as its decade-old predecessor</a>. Various <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">game updates have followed</a> to try and turn things around, though the project's commercial failure has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">Starbreeze's CEO ousted</a>, its previous game director step down, and one employee describe its launch as "disastrous". 
</p>
<p>
"The whole stage just collapsed and everyone left," Starbreeze community head Almir Listo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">said back in October</a>. "The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/tamashii-chronicles-of-ascend-review-uniquely-neon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tamashii-chronicles-of-ascend-review-uniquely-neon.1059072/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/tamashii-chronicles-of-ascend-review-uniquely-neon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Straight off the bat,&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> looks <em>Cyberpunk</em>. The box, the artwork and the components on opening it scream like something out of a dystopian future full of rogue machines and evil corporations. But does this scenario-drive board game feel <em>Cyberpunk</em>? In our review, we'll talk about how some of the mechanics work, and how it feels to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=0mwLJrVh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=XuswDyTN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>&nbsp;A part of the game in&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> is played on a hex map (Photo Credit: Awaken Realms).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamashii, </em>players represent a group of rebel allies battling against an omnipresent AI. Players have a unique ability to jump into the bodies of others, seeking out and selecting those that are best pace to achieve what they need to.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do when you start playing <em>Tamashii</em> is to choose a scenario, of which the core box includes 11 (including the prologue and finale). After the prologue, you can play the scenarios in any order, but you can only play the finale once you've gotten certain results on the scenario progress sheet.</p>

<p>In each&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>scenario, games&nbsp;are split between 2 key areas. The first is a map made up of hex tiles that represent the areas you will interact with. It works extremely well as a visual representation of how your character interacts with the world. Each tile isn't an area in a building, or even a necessarily linked building or street, but simply areas that your consciousness moves through as you progress. Each map tile offers a reward for being there, but each turn you remain there increases the trace value making it more likely you'll be found, and enemies stronger when they do.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-4.jpg?itok=1zOpzC8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-4.jpg?itok=o_N21miQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The major part of&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>gameplay takes part on the player's dashboards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second area of the game, and the core part, is on the dashboard that sits in front of you. This dashboard has a slot for the current body you inhabit, along with slots for upgrades, the trace track, which details how strong enemies are when they find you, and a place for enemy cards, because they attach to you, and not your character on the map. They also stack and build up on each other.</p>

<p>The final part of the dashboard, and the key part in the center, is the launcher, where you have different colored tokens. The arrangement of these tokens can unlock abilities and allow you to use basic actions along with giving access to the bodies that you can inhabit.</p>

<p>The game takes place over 4 phases, the planning phase, where you can move the tokens around on your dashboard in order to create the required patterns, the action phase, where you move and launch the actions from your dashboard, then combat and then the quest phase.</p>

<p>The rulebook doesn't do a great job of taking you through the game, but honestly, once you've played a game or 2, it all fits together nicely, and you'll enjoy the scenarios immensely, you just need to persevere when learning the rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-3.jpg?itok=SoLMkGwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-3.jpg?itok=I5sdSTAg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>initially has 8 bodies for you to inhabit during games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend Have Different Characters?</h2>

<p>The only characters you can play in <em>Tamashii </em>are those of the bodies you inhabit. There are 8 available initially, plus those built into your dashboard, each with their own pattern cost to inhabit and their own abilities and powers. The first bodies available are:</p>

<ul><li>Assassin</li>
	<li>Knight</li>
	<li>Rogue</li>
	<li>Scout</li>
	<li>Hacker</li>
	<li>Slasher</li>
	<li>Quaminator</li>
	<li>Visionary</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-2.jpg?itok=1bo6Tjp6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-2.jpg?itok=A374Sr4P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The scenarios are what drives&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>and each can be played in whichever order you like, or repeatedly to get different results.</figcaption></figure><h2>Can You Hack In Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>You don't hack as such in <em>Tamashii</em>, but the whole experience combines to create an extremely thematic <em>Cyberpunk</em> vibe. It all feels weirdly disembodied, the enemies attaching to you, the focus on the patterns and launching programs (which can defeat enemies without even going into combat), and the interaction with the world through the map, as well as the different bodies you can inhabit. I was honestly pretty skeptical about it at first, but it's captured the <em>Cyberpunk</em> theme better than any board game I've played previously, and aside from the original <em>Netrunner</em> card game, gives an extremely pleasing mechanics experience for hacking and jacking into bodies.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p><em>Tamashii </em>is an incredible <em>Cyberpunk</em> experience, once you get into it. The rulebook feels like hard work, but once you know what you're doing, it all feels incredibly thematic and satisfying. I'm usually slating games for their skin-deep theme, but&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>has really captured it, between the two areas of the game, and the scenarios themselves, it's a rich environment that feels completely attuned to the mechanics it uses. It's a rewarding experience overall.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>If you love all that is&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>is for you. You will love the look and the rich theme that the mechanics capture throughout. If <em>Cyberpunk</em> isn't your thing, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>loses some of its flair, as its real focus is on the scenarios that might not carry through on just the mechanics alone.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-adds-splitscreen-play-to-all-stages-and-more.1059069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update that adds the ability to play splitscreen across all of the game's stages, as well as new gameplay adjustments and more.</p>

<p>As the update's patch notes reveal, offline splitscreen matches can now be held in any of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s twelve stages. Previously, splitscreen play was limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber stage, but that limitation has officially been removed.</p>

<p>Back in June, Bandai Namco said it would be "difficult" to implement local splitscreen play while retaining&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s "core elements" of busy effects and terrain destruction, which is likely why splitscreen was previously limited to the largely-empty Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=OhDRUS0k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=PTdv00ez 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>now lets you play splitscreen on any stage.</figcaption></figure><p>However, now, thanks to this latest update's rather nebulous assertion that the devs have "improved performance and ease of use", it's possible to enjoy splitscreen play across any number of&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s levels.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the only improvement the update brings. You can also expect a number of quality-of-life improvements and gameplay adjustments, including the ability to skip battle animations during online matches, as well as a new High-Speed Dragon Dash move that lets you close distance to your opponent.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can read the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.asia/sea/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-free-update-1112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. I'd say it's almost certainly worth doing so if you're planning to jump into online play anytime soon.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest installment in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighting games, and the first game in the series since 2007's&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em>. Unlike previous games, it bears the series' original Japanese name of&nbsp;<em>Sparking!&nbsp;</em>in the West as well.</p>

<p>Placing an emphasis on lore-accurate power levels and movesets instead of pure competitive balance,&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>became the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">highest-charting Steam debut</a> when it launched in October, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million copies in a single day</a>.</p>

With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors</a></span> that the game has netted over $200 million in its first month, it’s now been officially announced that the mobile app has been downloaded over 60 million times since its October 30 launch. To accompany this news, the <em>Pocket</em> devs have revealed a rather big surprise: there’s to be a new special set of Mew-themed packs called Mythical Island, arriving in the game on December 17.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It was widely expected that a new set would join (rather than replace, given the game’s so-far redundant “Select Expansion” page) the launch set, Genetic Apex, at the end of January, as this would follow the three-monthly cycle of the real-world version of the TCG. But I don’t think anyone was expecting a new “Themed Booster Pack” set before the end of the year. That’s the designation given to Mythical Island, which—and I’m speculating somewhat here with ambiguous information—appears to be a smaller “special set” (it’s coded “A1a”, to Genetic Apex’s “A1”), with just Mew pack art, that’ll throw some excellent spanners into the current meta.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> has so far featured just Genetic Apex, the unfortunately named set (everyone else sees it as the codename for a <em>Wolfenstein</em>-style enemy project, right?) that has featured Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. While collecting the entire set <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">would take you over a year</a></span> without paying astonishing amounts of money, it’s been around long enough now that most people have the cards to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">build the decks that are dominating the meta</a></span>. In fact, if you take part in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406">fun new Emblem Event</a></span>, you’ll almost inevitably face either the Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise or Pikachu decks, almost without variation. So what the game really needs is a bunch of new cards thrown in to explode all that.</p><p>So hooray for news of Mythical Island in less than a week. The trailer flashes a whole bunch of new cards, including of course a Mew ex, which has a single energy 20 damage attack, but then a very Ditto-like ability for three energy (and energy of <em>any</em> type, making this a strong addition to any deck) called Genome Hacking. This lets you “choose 1 of your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s attacks and use it as this attack.”</p><p>However, I think the real game-changer is going to be an Aerodactyl ex that has an Ability to prevent your opponent from evolving their Active Pokémon. Given how much of the meta is based around such a move, this should shake things up! Better get used to evolving on the bench.</p><figure id="" data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also briefly glimpsed is a Vaporeon special art with a new Ability to transfer water energy between cards, and gorgeous special arts for Dedenne and Marshadow.</p><p>There are new Trainers, too, including Blue, who will reduce all incoming damage for a turn by 10 points, and Leaf who’ll really mess everything up by reducing retreat costs on your Active Pokémon by <em>two</em>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gundam-card-game-first-hands-on-ready-to-engage-pilot</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gundam-card-game-first-hands-on-ready-to-engage-pilot.1059051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gundam-card-game-first-hands-on-ready-to-engage-pilot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the surge of popularity among anime card games like One Piece and Digimon, it was only a matter of time until we saw another one get introduced into the TCG landscape. Enter the Gundam Card Game, which is yet another well-known anime franchise that joins the ranks of Dragon Ball and Bleach under the Bandai Card Games umbrella. This is not the first time Gundam had a card game, though. In 1999, Gundam War was released in Japan. Now, 25 years later, interest seems to be rising again. From what I’ve seen so far, the Gundam Card Game has very similar mechanics to other Bandai Card Games, but the couple of twists alongside a global release plan make this upcoming release a bit more exciting for both fans and competitive players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview event took place at the NASA Space Center in Houston which was fitting for the space setting that Mobile Suit Gundam is known for. After a brief presentation of the card game and some words from the special guest astronaut Anthony Antonelli, it was time to check out the game. It’s here that we got access to the cards with the opportunity to build our own decks using a mix of provided cards and packs from the Beta Edition. Being familiar with Bandai’s One Piece Card Game among many other TCGs, it was pretty easy to pick up Gundam from the get-go. If the unfamiliar keywords are a little intimidating, the cards usually describe what the mechanics do. With that said, it’s just the beginning of the Gundam Card Game, so mechanics aren’t too complicated at this point if you have any TCG experience.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Gundam Card Game - Beta Kit</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as TCGs go, the Gundam Card Game is pretty standard in regards to the types of cards and abilities you can play. There are four types of cards at the moment including Units, Pilots, Commands, and Bases. Units are of course the mech suits that fans all know and love. The Pilots are for the most part upgrades that you can attach to said Units to buff and occasionally add abilities. Commands are one-time use cards like spells in other games, with effects like drawing cards or removing units from the field. Finally, Bases are used as an extra defensive layer to protect the player’s life count. The goal of the game is to whittle down your opponent's shields down to zero before dealing the winning blow. So much of the gameplay is balancing between attacking your opponent’s units and shields and defending yourself with bases or units that can block with the help of command cards on both fronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The resource system is very interesting in this game, because not only does it help the players pay for things, but it also determines whether they can play strong or weak cards. Similar to One Piece and even Hearthstone if you’re not familiar with Bandai Card Games, the player gains resources or mana every turn up until the max of ten on the field. It is possible to get more resources with the help of EX resource cards, which are one-time use versions. Here’s the kicker: cards have both a cost and a level printed on the card. A player’s level is determined by how many resource cards they have in play. So if a player has five resource cards and one EX resource card, they can play a level 6 card – like the rare Wing Gundam unit – as long as they have the available active resources to do so. Even though Wing Gundam costs four resources to play, the player is not allowed to play it until they reach six resources. It sounds daunting to think about in regards to creating and balancing cards on the developer side, but it’s a nice way to progress the gameplay without dealing with super strong cards very early. At least that’s what it appears to do from my perspective. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/winggundam-1733965038414.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another cool mechanic of the game revolves around the Pilots. Of course with Gundam comes the various pilots from the many series, from the OG man himself Amuro Ray to the brooding Heero Yuy. In addition to improving the capabilities of any given Unit, some Pilots have their primary mech suits, which allow for a special status called Link Unit. When Amuro Ray is attached to an RX-78-2 Gundam, for instance, they gain the Link Unit status allowing the Gundam to attack immediately on the turn it was played. That’s the biggest plus when creating a Link Unit. Otherwise, some cards get added effects as well, like the Pilot Banagher Links, who draws one card when he and Unicorn Gundam gain Link Unit status when pairing. So when it comes to building a solid deck, these synergies seem to play a big part in getting the most value from the cards you are able to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the cards I had, I was able to create three mono-color decks in green, blue, and white. Green seems to be the more aggressive of the trio, with mechanics like Breach that do additional damage to the opponent’s shield when destroying units. Blue seems more like control, which the color is notoriously known for in card games. This includes pinging units for damage, healing, and even resting or dulling enemy units which allows for attacks on them. And white was full of units that can block, so it’s a very defensive play style. Players can build decks with a max of two colors, which was recommended per the inserts in the kit, but making your own decks is more fun! Not to mention the beautiful art on some of these cards in this game. Like other Bandai Card Games, we can expect totally new alternate art on many of these cards and that’s enough to get any Gundam fan interested in this.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/gaerialss-1733965059137.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting announcement for this game was the global release schedule. Having played the One Piece Card Game competitively for some time, there was a lot of discussion about the Japan meta, because the cards were released there first versus other territories. For instance, a card will be really strong in Japan’s competitive scene, so they nerf or ban it by the time it gets to other territories like the States. This didn’t make folks happy and otherwise made a strong and rare card useless. With the global release, this should alleviate all of those concerns and give everyone the same time with new cards before any kind of restriction is warranted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the Gundam Card Game was first revealed, I was excited to see anything Gundam, but to also crossover with a gaming medium that I love was the cherry on top. Having played with other TCGs and experiencing their communities, I can see something similar happening where fans of the series who don’t necessarily play card games want to jump into this game to check it out, which is always great to see. In the end, these kinds of games benefit from the existing fandom and the gameplay is interesting enough to make for some cool deck-building and matches. It’s just getting started, so I’m looking forward to checking out what else they’ll cook up as more sets come out. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it's including something it calls "Canon Mode" in upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, and if you've ever wondered which dialogue option your character would actually pick, this one's for you.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) session</a>, creative director Jonathan Dumont says Canon Mode was included to address the fact that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s fanbase is "divided on branching dialogues".</p>

<p>If you select Canon Mode, then dialogue choices will be made for you so that you don't have to worry about whether what you're doing is in character or not. Dumont says this should give players a "choice free experience", which feels like a slightly odd way of wording it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-conversation.jpg?itok=5Yj3fe7q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-conversation.jpg?itok=ceIC5JxH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will let you have the game decide which response it should give on your behalf in dialogue trees.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the length of the game, Dumont says that while it's "hard to evaluate" such things in open-world games due to player variables, he thinks&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' main campaign is "comparable to&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>/<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>" in terms of length.</p>

<p>Again, that feels like a slightly odd answer to give when considering that these three games take different amounts of time to beat.&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>' campaign sits at around 25-30 hours, while&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>'s takes about 45 hours and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>'s can take up to 60.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that you're probably not in for a short ride with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so hopefully it doesn't have the same level of bloat that&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla&nbsp;</em>could often exhibit.</p>

<p>The AMA offers plenty of other interesting information about&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>; it'll <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jz42g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature an "immersive mode"</a> with a full Japanese voiceover, for instance, and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jv74t/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modern story</a> will be "limited" and connected to the new Animus Hub, although we'll get more on this "later".</p>




<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. Set in Sengoku-era Japan, it'll follow the RPG stylings of the likes of <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow">Odyssey</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a>&nbsp;</em>and not the back-to-basics approach of last year's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage" rel="nofollow"><em>Mirage</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since its announcement, the game has garnered its fair share of controversy. Some players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">objected to the inclusion of historical figure Yasuke</a> as one of the main playable characters, an inclusion Ubisoft says demonstrates its ability to take "creative license" to construct "engaging and immersive experiences".</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>also prompted outcry when a concept art book was found to have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology" rel="nofollow">appropriated images from a Japanese group</a> without permission, and when an "insensitive" figurine depicting a one-legged Torii gate was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insensitive-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-controversy" rel="nofollow">pulled from sale in October</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in February next year, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> from its original November release date.</p>

But perhaps the most interesting reveal is the “Canon Mode,” designed to appease players who are concerned about the game’s branching storylines, given the series’ focus on synchronizing with the past.</p><p>“Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and romance [sic] some of the characters,” said Jonathan Dumont, the director on <em>Shadows</em>. “Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called CANON MODE which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice free experience.” Elsewhere in the thread Dumont adds, “You will still be able to switch characters in [the] open in this mode.”</p><p>This news was met with delight by those taking part in the AMA. “Wait, WHAT??? Are you serious? That’s basically what the fanbase has been asking for since 2018,” said one person. “Oh my god, amazing,” replied another. A third suggested, “Wild pitch: retroactively add this mode to <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there are some very loud voices that strongly believe all games should only be playable in their hardest modes, back in real life everyone approaches games very differently. Some seek super-hard, reflex-heavy combat, and want to be told the story by a fixed narrator, while others love to become embroiled in a twisting narrative on which they have huge influence but want to walk away at the sight of a boss fight. And indeed, everything in-between, outside of that, and the whole lot combined.</p><p>Ubisoft has been making some big strides in the games it <em>does</em> release regarding letting players structure a game according to their own tastes, and while it’s fair to say the publisher has led the way in this regard, many others are now following. Where once we were lucky to choose between Easy, Normal and Hard, it’s becoming more commonplace to let a player tweak specific aspects of their $70 purchase, creating the tone of game that best suits their desires. (We’re edging closer and closer to my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skippable boss fight future</a></span>.)</p><p>It seems yet another step in this direction to offer an option to those who simply don’t want to make narrative choices for whatever reason. There are many <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> die-hards who want a single, pure storyline, to make sense of the game’s reliving history through memory, and find the player-driven deviations, well, deviant. For others it could be choice paralysis—that awful fear that you might be picking the “wrong” option, and then worrying about that instead of enjoying the game. The Canon Mode will automatically select what the developers consider the true, historical path through the game, which the same AMA confirms will have a single canon ending.</p><p>And, of course, for those who find the idea plain strange, it is just an option, with a branching storyline for the two different characters set as the game’s default.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mythical Island is the first proper Pokémon TCG Pocket mini-set since the title’s launch. It brings with it the second-ever booster pack for players to pull new cards, and we know its release date, as well as a bunch of cards revealed for the set.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansion leaks</a> continue to be true. We heard weeks ago a mini-set was scheduled for the third week in December, and now we know what it is. Pokémon TCG Pocket Mythical Island is a fully-fledged mini-set not quite on the scale of Genetic Apex, but it’s easily the most significant collection of cards—outside of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A</a> series.</p>



<p>The Mythical Island debut trailer gave us a huge glimpse into the set and what to expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-mythical-island-set-release-date-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Mythical Island Set Release Date in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Just look at it. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island set launches on Dec. 17.</strong></p>



<p>No official release time was given in the debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUYHC2ReohA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island trailer</a>. So, expect a midnight rollout for the set in your region. Once it’s live, select the new booster pack, start ripping them open, and get building the newest set in Pocket.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-open-mythical-island-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island">How to Open Mythical Island Packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h2>



<p>We don’t know for sure, but I imagine once Mythical Island is live, the <strong>advertised packs on the home page are going to change to reflect the new set</strong>. Meaning, you can press on any of the advertised Mythical Island packs, and it takes you straight to them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it still shows Genetic Apex packs on the home screen once the new set launches, try this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the home screen.</li>



<li>Press on any of the Genetic Apex packs to take you to the pack screen.</li>



<li>Choose “Select other booster packs” in the bottom-right corner to presumably choose Mythical Island.</li>



<li>Now, open Mythical Island packs!</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s hard to know fully what Pokémon TCG Pocket looks like when Mythical Island launches, so we’ll update this once we have a clearer indication.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How Many Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>NetEase hasn’t divulged how many cards are coming in Mythical Island, but thanks to the debut trailer, we’ve identified at least <strong>15 new cards coming in the set</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s every card we think we’ve spotted in Mythical Island so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerodactyl ex</li>



<li>Blue (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Dedenne (Full Art)</li>



<li>Dhelmise</li>



<li>Exeggcute</li>



<li>Larvesta</li>



<li>Leaf (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Magmar</li>



<li>Marshadow (Full Art)</li>



<li>Mew ex</li>



<li>Morelull</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Snivy</li>



<li>Tauros</li>



<li>Vaporean (Full Art)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-rarest-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Rarest Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Dedenne, Marshadow, and Vaporean Full Art</strong> cards, along with <strong>Mew ex</strong> and <strong>Aerodactyl ex</strong>, are the rarest cards we’ve seen in the Mythical Island set.</p>



<p>More could still be announced, and the full set is likely keeping some secrets under its belt. We can all find out together once Mythical Island is live!</p>
