            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-producer-reveals-surprising-inspirations-and-its-not-persona-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail studio HoYoverse’s newest upcoming title, Zenless Zone Zero, is a fusion of what you’d expect from HoYoverse games with totally new ideas. The game studio's development processes are largely a mystery, but in an interview with Zenless Zone Zero producer Zhenyu Li at a media event, IGN learned a little more about what goes into kicking off an entirely new game at HoYoverse, Zenless Zone Zero’s future, and at least this particular team’s position on generative AI. </p><p>Zenless Zone Zero (also known as ZZZ) is an action game with a heavy emphasis on its flashy urban landscape set in an apocalyptic world. Players take their team of three into monster-infested roguelike zones, then bounce back to the city landscape to complete side quests, get to know characters better, and maybe grab a cup of coffee or bowl of ramen. </p><p>Like the other HoYoverse games, its variety of stylish characters with combat specializations is arguably its biggest focal point. As the entertainment landscape <a href="https://www.ign.com/special/ai-week"><u>has been in a tumult</u></a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/how-ai-could-change-video-games-forever"><u>with the rush in the development of generative AI</u></a>, we couldn't help but ask: is the Zenless Zone Zero team using generative AI in development, or is it planning to?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think that the human touch is more meaningful right now and this is what our team is pursuing.</p></div><p>"Today, no," Li said. "For the art part, we have not tried it, but we have tried a part of it to touch on the programming. As for the art aspect, I think that the human touch is more meaningful right now and this is what our team is pursuing."</p><p>This approach seems to be in line with what the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-honkai-star-rail-is-using-ai-technology-to-supplement-development"><u> Honkai: Star Rail team explored in using AI for development as of last year.</u></a> </p><p>Li also explained that when developing ZZZ's characters, the aesthetics came first early on. However, that changed as development progressed. The planning team responsible for character mechanics and the art team now work closely together to create new characters. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zzz-1718737408431.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Zenless Zone Zero releases on July 4. </figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>The Zenless Zone Zero Team and Collaboration</strong></h2><p>The development team behind HoYoverse’s massive games has largely been a mystery, though Li offered some context on how the ZZZ team behind that handmade art came to be. Li said it began with only 12 people in its initial demo stages in 2020 before growing to around 60 people during its first closed beta. Now, it's ballooned to more than 400 team members.</p><p>"Zenless Zone Zero’s development team is very young and a lot of us come from different backgrounds," Li said. "We have veterans from the gaming industry but also young talents who share the same values and are all passionate about getting involved in the creation of an interesting product. Indeed, some team members including myself had experiences working on HoYoverse's other projects before. Take me for instance: I used to take care of the CG, animation, and video for Honkai Impact 3rd."</p><p>Li clarified that the ZZZ team only works on their project rather than swapping between other HoYoverse properties and that collaboration between the different game teams is "quite rare." </p><p>"Not that it doesn't exist," Li said. "I'll check with the teams for an advisor such as [for] the technical aspects."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Zenless Zone Zero Inspirations</strong></h2><p>Li acknowledged that the ZZZ team received many comparisons to Persona 5 with both sharing a stylish city setting, though he said they're hoping to create something unique. And though there may be some visual and musical similarities, the heart of the game doesn't have its roots in Persona. </p><p>Aside from the urban setting, one element that reminds Persona players like myself of Atlus' series is ZZZ's time system. Similar to Persona 5, ZZZ has four points in the day with different activities available as time passes with mission completion and other triggers. Li explained his inspiration for ZZZ's time mechanic was actually instead from a much older game important to his childhood: Digimon World. The 1999 game also features a clock with specific events that happen at particular times throughout the day.</p><p>The other major inspiration was, surprisingly, Street Fighter 6. Though ZZZ is an action game more akin to DMC and not a fighting game, you can see the inspirations in its fast combat, emphasis on stunning enemies, and chaining combos. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Zenless Zone Zero’s development team is very young and a lot of us come from different backgrounds.</p></div><p>Li mentioned he's spent thousands of hours in the Street Fighter series and learned a lot about the feedback of its action with "how [each] punch really feels that it’s on the flesh of only your own flesh." Li said the ZZZ team is trying to draw inspiration from their own combat and make each animation frame matter. </p><p>Another major lesson Li took from Street Fighter 6 was how to pace tutorials for newcomers to action games. Pacing of all ZZZ's mechanics has changed quite a lot between each of its closed betas, and Li said the planning team has tried to make sure all important tutorials are more spread out to not be overwhelming. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zenless-1718737700300.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Zenless Zone Zero is the latest from Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail studio HoYoverse.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Potential Future of Zenless Zone Zero</strong></h2><p>When ZZZ launches on July 4, it'll be available on PlayStation 5, mobile devices, and PC, but Li said they're not stopping development there. They're working to bring ZZZ to Nintendo Switch and Xbox too, though Li framed ZZZ's arrival on these platforms as a hope and not something quite set in stone.</p><p>As a live service game, though, it is set in stone that ZZZ will get content updates. Li confirmed this will include things like expansions to the city with new neighborhoods, shops, and of course, characters. </p><p>"We have a basic framework for the story timeline, but we're also a very flexible team," Li said when asked about how far they've planned ZZZ's story. "We constantly review what we've created in the past to see if we can continue to utilize it or if we have better ideas and solutions."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"When designing these characters, we would always consider what players haven't seen before.</p></div><p>One international HoYoverse fan request has been for better representation in characters, especially in the HoYoverse games that feature real-life inspirations of diverse cultures yet neglect to reflect the people who live there. Steps to reflect these international audiences have been taken to varying degrees, and ZZZ's amalgamation city provides fresh opportunity to do more. </p><p>"In Zenless Zone Zero, we have created a wide range of characters. When designing these characters, we would always consider what players haven't seen before. We want to ensure characters of various types are included, so players can look forward to more imaginative designs that will surprise them in the future."</p><p>"I think our team has added almost everything we wanted for the launch and the game is ready for players," Li said. "However, of course, we have plenty of interesting ideas and plans for the game in the future which we will share more at the right time. One thing that I particularly want to share is that the multiplayer battle mode is already under development. I hope players can look forward to this mode in future version updates."</p><p><em>Miranda Sanchez is the Executive Editor of Guides at IGN.

  <p id="2jx9D7">Lucasfilm’s new Star Wars series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star_wars_the_acolyte/s01/reviews">earned praise</a> for simply existing outside of the Skywalker Saga — after 47 years of stories set in the same stretch of timeline, a jump back <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">“100 years before the rise of the Empire”</a> to the shinier High Republic era is enough for aching Star Wars fans. But even with a prohibitively old setting and a cast of characters divorced from Anakin and Luke, <em>The Acolyte</em> creator Leslye Headland is still finding ways to pepper the drama with Easter eggs. Episode 4 gave those in the know a whopper: Plo Koon.</p>
<p id="qetf4D">Plo Koon, the Kel Dor Jedi known for his chic oxygen mask, first appeared in scenes of the Jedi council in <em>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</em> and grew into a fan favorite when he took on an action role in <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>. Plo’s biggest fan might be <em>The Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni, who has made his passion for the B-tier Jedi extremely clear to the Star Wars fandom over the last 20 years, having cosplayed at conventions as the Jedi, snapped photos with fellow cosplayers, and showed off his Plo Koon toy collection on social media. His “personal life” section <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dave_Filoni">on Wookieepedia</a> is entirely facts about his Plo Koon collectibles. Despite him being one or two levels removed from a Glup Shitto, Dave Filoni is all in on Plo Koon.</p>

<p id="8qw4sh">I believe Filoni when he says he has talked extensively about Plo Koon with George Lucas. Reportedly, when the animator was pushing to beef up Plo’s part in the <em>The Clone Wars</em>, there were plans to cast an actor who sounded like Toshiro Mifune in <em>Seven Samurai</em> to give the Jedi a samurai feel. But Lucas thought the character was goofier than that and wanted a Jim Carrey type. Filoni landed on actor James Arnold Taylor because of his Gandalf vibes. The Lucas-versus-Filoni Plo-off doesn’t end there; at Star Wars Celebration 2023, Filoni admitted that he made the case to his boss that Plo Koon, due to #skillz, obviously would have survived Order 66. Lucas shot down the canon alteration request, but Filoni stands by his defense.</p>
<div id="mtojoo"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/602zh2NzQ5o" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Ln2jAJ">None of this was relevant to <em>The Acolyte</em>… until now. For a split second, standing in a drop shop with Osha on their way to meet the Wookiee Jedi Kelnacca, is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-him appearance by Plo Koon, who has not actually appeared in live action since <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. How could Plo be alive during the High Republic era? That’s very human of you to ask, but just like Yoda, he is technically old enough to be around kicking; nerd number-crunching based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/fbgf3y/plo_koons_age_in_legends/">decanonized Legends materials</a> puts him around 382 years old during the time of <em>The Clone Wars</em>, which should make him already a seasoned veteran of the Jedi in <em>The Acolyte</em>. </p>
<p id="lWQ5MV">For a hot second, it sounded like Filoni may have snuck his guy into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-mandalorian"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>. Leaks hinted at a potential reveal in the season 2 finale, but as it turned out, early storyboards and VFX footage were all <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22641121/mandalorian-luke-skywalker-cameo-leaks-plo-koon">an elaborate scheme</a> to hide the return of a de-aged Luke Skywalker. “All it takes is one person treating the film in color correction, one person who goes on social media and says, ‘Guess what I saw today?’” Mark Hamill said in the <em>Disney Gallery</em> making-of doc centered on the episode. What no one seemed to care about at the time was how mad Filoni’s fellow Plo Koonheads must have felt! </p>
<p id="wGQwtb">Technically, <em>The Acolyte</em> is one of the few Star Wars projects that Dave Filoni does not seem directly involved with; he doesn’t share any writing or directing credits on the series, nor does he hold a general producer credit. (By all accounts, his attention is fully on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23896100/star-wars-ahsoka-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Ahsoka </em>season 2</a>.) And maybe it’s THE Plo Koon. In theory this unnamed Jedi is just another Force-sensitive Kel Dor.</p>
<p id="nGG63o">But c’mon, it’s Plo Koon. And it makes sense why Headland would want the cameo. As the showrunner has said, she purposefully set up her writers room to represent <a href="https://www.avclub.com/leslye-headland-s-favorite-star-wars-is-the-star-wars-y-1847118044">a broad spectrum of Star Wars fandoms</a> and surrounded herself with people who could bring their own Easter egg wishlists to the table. So while longtime fans may have prayed at the altar of George Lucas, others involved were weaned on <em>The Clone Wars</em> — and Filoni’s pro-Plo brand of fandom. So it’s no surprise that <em>The Acolyte</em> would find ways to nod to the OT, the prequels, and even the cartoons that have little in common with its world: If you are on the right side of Star Wars history, you make room for Plo Koon.</p>
<p id="K5l2HS"><em><strong>Correction: </strong></em><em>A previous version of this story stated that Plo Koon last appeared in live-action in The Phantom Menace, but his final live-action appearance was in Revenge of the Sith. We’ve edited the article to reflect this. </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177908/star-wars-acolyte-tv-they-them-pronouns-stop-being-weird-about-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="BpP9lL">In the fourth episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, Osha (Amandla Stenberg) meets some new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult">Jedi</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading">Jedi-affiliated</a> friends. One of them is a small, otterlike creature named Bazil. Bazil and Pip, Osha’s fussy robot companion, keep sniffing and beeping at each other, interrupting the mission briefing Osha is trying to follow. After, Osha approaches Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) for an awkward exchange all too familiar to queer people watching television in the last few years: </p>
<blockquote>
<p id="Edd5i1">Osha: Who is that?</p>
<p id="VBiblj">Jecki Lon: That’s Bazil.</p>
<p id="YK8ZQT">Osha: Is he [<em>dramatic pause</em>]… <em>or they</em>… with us?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="MUCiuF">This is the latest example of what I’m going to call <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/the-other-two-disney-character-globby-has-a-real-gay-twin.html">the Globby problem</a>, expertly parodied on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23727452/other-two-lance-josh-segarra-hot-yes"><em>The Other Two</em></a>: well-meaning writers and showrunners — some of them queer themselves — trying to awkwardly insert nonbinary or genderqueer representation into their show, usually through the show’s requisite “weirdo” character. The result is, instead, often pretty othering.</p>
<p id="uwsaCZ">In <em>The Acolyte</em>, Osha only asks about Bazil’s pronouns, not those of any of the other people she meets. This reveals more about Osha than I think <em>The Acolyte</em>’s<em> </em>writers were intending; the exchange implies she is actively othering Bazil and assuming he (yes, it is later revealed Bazil uses he/him pronouns, which makes all of this even sillier) must be gender-variant because he looks odd to her.</p>
<p id="ogwBoz">I get that the effort is to remind the viewer that not everyone subscribes to a binary of gender expression, and Osha is trying to be open-minded about that. To be clear, I’m not asking for every character to ask every other character about their pronouns when they first meet. That would be extremely boring television! It’s very easy to establish characters’ pronouns by having other characters use those pronouns when speaking about them. This happens all the time. (“This is Bazil, they’ll be helping us on the ground” is the easiest thing in the world to put into a conversation, in a world where Bazil uses they/them pronouns.) But <em>The Acolyte</em> going out of its way to make a show of only asking about the character who looks the most different is quite weird (and unfortunately makes Osha kind of look like a dick). The end result is that no one is happy — toxic Star Wars fans are mad for the usual bigoted reasons, and I’m mad because it’s so thoughtless.</p>
<p id="i2tA2W">Because it’s not just <em>The Acolyte</em>!<em> </em>Even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168842/star-trek-discovery-finale-interview-showrunner-end"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>, a show that largely had thoughtful and committed queer representation and characters, stumbled with this during its recently aired final season. As Captain Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) approaches an alien planet, she turns to a crewmate and marvels, full of awe, at how the planet has three genders. Except Captain Burnham’s ship, the Discovery, <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-trans-non-binary-blu-del-barrio-ian-alexander-1234824183/">has (at least) three genders represented on board</a>!!! Within that context, that makes Captain Burnham sound like a captain who, at the very best, forgot she has a nonbinary crew member on board, and at worst doesn’t respect that crew member’s gender identity. There is not a chance that was the intended effect of the <em>Discovery </em>writers room, but that’s the only way to read that line within the context of the show.</p>
<p id="faU9RP">These examples clearly seem to be the result of showrunners and writers who mean well and want to be inclusive, but stumble along the way. It ends up othering nonbinary and genderqueer people even more when you consider which characters get placed in that position, and when other characters ask about pronouns. At the end of the day, while broader representation of more genders is good, making a show of asking for pronouns in your television show is not necessarily a net positive. When characters are only doing so to characters who are markedly, visibly different — even straight-up animals, in Bazil’s case — it’s weird! It doesn’t feel like an honest attempt at accurately reflecting gender and its many different variations and contexts, but instead like they’re thinking of representation as a checklist that can be achieved through language alone.</p>
<p id="eAwIeA">In the case of <em>The Acolyte</em>, it feels like at best an empty gesture and empty pandering toward queer fans, and at worst Disney weaponizing the most toxic fans in the Star Wars fan base to drive conversation by making sure they’re predictably mad about nothing. Personally, I don’t fully buy that latter theory, but I think it is notable that if Disney wanted to design empty gestures that got toxic fans mad without actually being transgressive in any meaningful way, it would look exactly like this scene in <em>The Acolyte.</em></p>
<p id="ATNYgT">On the positive side of things, the recent <em>Doctor Who </em>episode “Rogue” is a good example of how to do this naturally. While talking about a former love, Rogue (Jonathan Groff) just says “I lost them” without it being some big performative gesture that he would deign to use an “unconventional” singular pronoun. And hey — maybe the person he was talking about doesn’t use they/them pronouns, and Rogue just didn’t want to be too specific. The important thing is, he said it like a person, not like he just won a GLAAD award for allyship. More shows that want to dip into broader gender representation should give that a shot. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exoborne-first-preview-extraction-from-the-eye-of-the-storm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Today’s forecast: chaos and violence.</h2></div><section><p>With the blurb “Gear up, get in, and get out”, Exoborne elegantly sets out its stall as an extraction shooter. But they left out the most important part: “Get blown around by a massive tornado”. While Exoborne bears all the features you’d expect from the likes of Escape from Tarkov and Call of Duty: Warzone’s DMZ, the most exciting part of a presentation I saw at Play Days was when developer Sharkmob talked about the weather.</p><p>Exoborne’s setting is not postapocalyptic, but rather midapocalyptic, with the world falling apart all around you – the result of mankind’s meddling with the climate. Project Rebirth’s attempts to provide limitless clean energy have backfired somewhat, and now Mother Nature is taking her revenge. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Exoborne Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Extraction shooters live or die on emergent gameplay, and there’s nothing as emergent as a twister, flood or tsunami. The weather during a session of Exoborne can change from clement to hellscape in minutes – all of which has profound effects on gameplay, according to Sharkmob. </p><p>A 10-minute walkthrough video based on a pre-Alpha build of the game began with a short cutscene where a group of teammates known as The Reborn assemble in a dropship and prepare to jump. The character models are based on whatever skins and loadouts each player has selected, so this is a nice chance to show off your flair before the action starts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The players then skydived from the dropship, parachuting in to the map below. Action kicked off immediately, as this area of Colton County in the Southeast USA was infested with killer robotic machines and human enemies. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Over a longer play session, you can expect a dynamic range of climates to impede your progress. The rain apparently gets so heavy you can no longer hear your teammates, their comms drowned out by the deluge, forcing players to rethink their strategies.</p></div><p>Kill, loot, equip – so far, so extraction shooter. Entering a base located nearby required some teamwork, and the destruction of some AT-ST-like enemy walkers, while at another point the squad clambered aboard a Warthog-style armored vehicle with open top/sides/back for ease of blasting. Maps are as vertical as they are wide, with towers connected by huge Rebirth Cables that snake through the environment, placed by the architects at Rebirth without regard for the scenery or the human residents; these industrial eyesores allow players to ascend with grappling hooks and fight on higher ground. Burned-out school buses and a busted motel sign litter the deserted streets of what might long ago have been an idyllic rural town. Sinkholes offer the chance to explore underground.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Exoborne Images</h3></div></output><p>And then came the tornado warning. Once the weather hit, the squad cut their mission short, calling in the dropship and climbing aboard with the loot before things got hairy. But a Sharkmob developer explained that over a longer play session, you can expect a dynamic range of climates to impede your progress. The rain apparently gets so heavy you can no longer hear your teammates, their comms drowned out by the deluge, forcing players to rethink their strategies.</p><p>While the risk may be high in any given session, Sharkmob has designed Exoborne to be more forgiving in the longer term. That is, extraction is not always guaranteed, and you may lose items in a given session if you don’t make it out alive – but the game makes it possible to rebuild your arsenal over future games, improving your character from game to game as you loot and progress. The idea is to make the game as approachable as possible for newcomers, who may find the high risk of other extraction shooters off-putting.</p><p>Throw in a bunch of cool near-future weapons, tech gear and Exo-Rigs, and of course a mix of PVP and PVE scavenging action, and Exoborne is shaping up to be a cool addition to the genre.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-story-demo-serves-up-sick-tricks-and-cool-vibes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Skateboarding has always been cool. Somehow, Skate Story adds something new.</h2></div><section><p>Skate Story’s vibe gripped me right away. Its liminal, Vaporwave-inspired levels mix hyper-realistic concrete textures, lighting effects, and objects like a chain-link fence or The Moon with engrossingly impressionistic flourishes like The Skater’s body, which is made of kaleidoscopic glass, or the on-looking, ever-judgemental eyes whose disembodied voices screech in unison in disdain for your quest. It’s a lot to take in, but never too overwhelming. These levels felt just wild enough to imbue each moment with its own distinct sense of cool without distracting me from the mission at hand: skating.</p><p>Skating might be the most normal thing about Skate Story. That’s not to say it’s bad or uninteresting, but it does feel exactly how you’d want a skating game to feel. It has a great sense of speed as you accelerate by holding down or mashing the A button to go as quickly as humanly possible. This game’s tight camera really emphasized that sense of speed too, focusing on your crystalline avatar as they lean into any momentum they can get a hold of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Skate Story Slideshow - Tribeca Festival</h3></div></output><p>I saw a pretty early section of the game, so tricks and jumps—while fun—were pretty simple. Holding down a specific button controls one of The Skater’s feet, and hitting another button initiates the trick itself. Each trick and jump works on a timer, with a little notch sliding around the outline of an organic shape. Releasing the button for a trick or jump while the notch is floating around in the thicker part of said outline will execute it perfectly, and reward you with better air time. Doing a trick with imperfect timing didn’t seem to cause that much of an issue, but I’m certain it will become increasingly important later on in Skate Story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It shot up to the top of my Steam wishlist after my hands-on demo at Summer Game Fest this year.</p></div><p>The levels I played had me zooming down tight corridors, exploring a courtyard, jumping over deadly neon red nettles, and visiting museum gift shops at the behest of verbose statues. Although that speed demonic camera worked wonders for Skate Story’s feel, it sometimes betrayed its flexibility of movement and occasionally even fought against its own sense of speed and pace as it obscured certain objectives or obstacles in some levels. Obstacles are usually easy enough to vault over, even with a split-second’s notice. But The Skater is made out of glass, so even the slightest error can set you back a spell, making the camera problem a tad more frustrating than it would be otherwise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unreliable camera aside, each level presented a satisfyingly diverse approach to design and pacing with repetition cleverly punctuating important moments while twisting what I’d already seen into something new and fresh thanks to its unexpectedly charming writing. Developer Sam Eng told me that this semi-autobiographical story is inspired by true events, but didn’t go much deeper than that. The chunk I saw was so strange and impressionistic that I can’t wait to see where Sam takes the story next. In my half hour with the demo, I watched as The Skater set out on their quest to shatter the moon. Culminating in a trial to prove their worth—and their skating chops—Skate Story’s writing and sense of humor stand in a league of their own. This isn’t just because its metaphorical approach is weird, but because it had me chuckling all the way through.</p><p>With a promising story, absorbing vibe, and responsive skating controls, Skate Story has so much potential as both a distinct story and a damn cool skating game. It shot up to the top of my Steam wishlist after my hands-on demo at Summer Game Fest this year, and I can’t wait to see the weird places this wildly expressive skating game goes.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/critter-cafe-cute-critters-and-a-cozy-cafe-await-you<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Cute creatures and open-ended customization options seem like the perfect game for any cozy gamer, especially ones who aren’t looking for very challenging puzzles.</h2></div><section><p>Critter Cafe embodies coziness. From its rescue cafe premise to its no-holds-barred approach to customization and decoration that encourages players to express themselves, the brief demo I watched and played pointed to a consistent, refined vision that I have a feeling will be a big hit for fans of monster collecting games who are looking for something cozy to sink their teeth into.</p><p>Blending monster collecting, management simulation, and puzzle-based dungeon crawling sounds a lot more overwhelming than it actually is in Critter Cafe. That’s not to say that this comfy game from Sumo Digital and Secret Mode is oversimplified, just that it’s chill and approachable. Like any sim worth its salt, customization is the name of the game here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With in-depth customization options (that can be changed at any time) for my chibi avatar and full-on cafe customization, the world is your aesthetic oyster in Critter Cafe. I was blown away at how much I could do to precisely mold the cafe to my liking. From wallpaper and floorboards to furniture—even the materials it was made from—I felt a sense of control and freedom over the cafe in a way that can often elude some games in this genre.</p><p>To give you a proper sense of what I mean, let’s look at Animal Crossing: New Horizons, for example. It’s a stellar game to be sure, but one whose customization suite leaves a lot to be desired. Changing your island or house takes a lot of work. Beyond the steps to actually unlock the recipe for something, you’ll often need tons of resources to craft said piece, which can be gated based on the real-life passage of time. But even without the progressive aspect of unlocking new recipes, clothes, etc. the process of customizing a home gets really tedious really quickly.</p><p>Not so in Critter Cafe, where customization options are available to you from the get-go. This allows for other mechanics and parts of the game to shine while still letting you express yourself to the fullest without jumping through extra hoops. Redecorating isn’t just for fun, though. Instead, you’ll often need to change the cafe at a customer’s request for special events. Indeed, these events are one of the ways you can grow and improve your cafe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Critter Cafe Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Let’s say a customer wants to have a movie night. You can redecorate with movie theater-themed furniture to cater to your customer’s desires. They might also share other aesthetic preferences and even tell you what kind of critter they’d like to spend time with. If you hit a high enough mark for a customer, they might even tell you where to find a portal that will take you to a new critter to befriend.</p><p>These adorable little beasties are mostly amalgamations of real-life and mythical animals with some kind of endearing twist or change. My favorite looks like a kit-bash between a dinosaur and a duck. But making a new feathered friend isn’t as simple as walking through a portal. Instead, you’ll need to complete a small block-pushing puzzle to find your new buddy at the end of a cave.</p><p>Normal service is a little bit more complex than the special events, and will help you and your critter deepen your bond as your reputation grows. Growing your reputation is the other main way that you’ll progress in Critter Cafe, so it’s important to balance leveling up your reputation while also making sure to make new friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These adorable little beasties are mostly amalgamations of real-life and mythical animals with some kind of endearing twist or change.</p></div><p>My one gripe with what I saw of Critter Cafe was how simple those puzzles seemed. Yes, this is a cozy game first and foremost, so they’re probably not going to be Portal-level brain busters, but they seemed potentially lacking in diversity. That said, the puzzles I saw weren’t bad. In fact, they seemed like the perfect level of challenge to give me something to do in between running a cafe and hosting special events, but these same puzzles didn’t seem to promise much in the way of verticality or evolution based on what I’ve played and seen in trailers and screenshots.</p><p>If in fact they don’t grow or change much, they could seriously undermine the wholesome creature-befriending scenes at the end of each puzzle. Part of what made this demo special was how exciting it was to meet a new critter. If that gets pulverized into something tedious or repetitive, that could very easily dampen Critter Cafe’s otherwise exuberant nature.</p><p>I’m really interested in seeing what kinds of whimsical combinations Sumo Digital has in store for the rest of Critter Cafe. I hope the next time I hear about it brings more stuff to do while befriending critters and tells me a little bit more about its story, which seemed pretty light in the demo. But even if there’s no overarching plot to speak of, I’m certain its deep customization suite and critter designs will almost definitely appease the most rabid cozy gamers looking for their next obsession.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I was told to expect a handful of ports, remakes, and remasters sprinkled throughout the rest of 2024. I was told the Switch was dying.</p><p>Well, apparently no one told Nintendo. And if they did, Nintendo certainly wasn’t listening, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>today’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> was one of my favorites in years, with surprise announcements that will make the wait for Nintendo’s next console incredibly easy. Don’t unplug the dock from your entertainment center just yet, because the Switch still has plenty of juice left.</p><p>If you were completely removed from the video game news cycle and you watched the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, you’d probably think it was a presentation dropped somewhere during the peak of the console’s life cycle. Nintendo really brought out the big guns with new entries in its classic trio of franchises: Mario, Zelda, and Metroid. We got our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-revealed">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, a brand new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">mainline The Legend of Zelda game starring the eponymous princess</a> for the first time, and the long-awaited <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-opens-with-mario-luigi-brothership">return of the Mario &amp; Luigi series</a>, continuing the fairytale-like resurgence of Mario RPGs over the last year.

The top two will surprise no one!</p></div><p>I really appreciate Nintendo’s focus on concrete release dates in its Directs. The Xbox showcase this year was <em>awesome, </em>but we were left with a lot of “TBA” or generic “2025” dates. I’m super excited for games like Fable and Perfect Dark, and can’t wait to eventually get them, but it’s a lot easier to be more excited about a new Zelda game I didn’t know existed when I woke up this morning that will be in my hands exactly 100 days from now. </p><p>And The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom really looks like my dream game. Everything we know so far points to Nintendo taking the explorative, creative spirit of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and injecting it into the top-down Zelda formula. In today’s reveal trailer we see Zelda building a column of water and ascending to its surface, stacking beds to create a makeshift ladder, and running across treetops 2D Zelda has forever used as barriers for the player. Plus, this is a Zelda game without a sword, and it’s allowing the developers to truly go crazy with combat and puzzle possibilities. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Echoes of Wisdom looks like my dream game.</p><p>BotW/TotK's spirit in a top-down game.</p><p>Convention breaking!

Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is the first Mario &amp; Luigi game in nearly a decade, and it marks the franchise’s home console debut. After Mario &amp; Luigi developer AlphaDream sadly went bankrupt in 2019, it seemed like the series was dead, so it was a huge surprise to see this game kick off the Direct. We still don’t know who is developing Brothership (Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake"><u>frustratingly quiet about this</u></a>), but hopefully Nintendo brought on some of AlphaDream’s talent to continue the series.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn’t coming until sometime in 2025, but how great was it to finally see what it looks like now, over seven years since its original announcement? It certainly appears to be a faithful Metroid Prime game, complete with the iconic HUD, raindrop effects on Samus’ arm cannon, and the return of the detective-like scanning ability. As a huge Mario Party fan, I also loved seeing a brand new entry that seems to learn from the strides the series took in 2021’s Mario Party Superstars, with bigger boards, more minigames, and tons of characters to choose from. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first-party surprises were the stars of the show, but I have to give a shoutout to some of the great third-party games developers are still bringing to Switch. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-is-as-faithful-as-you-could-ask">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake looks gorgeous</a>, and it was a phenomenal surprise to learn that Dragon Quest I and II are getting the same treatment. And, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-revealed-remasters-two-spin-offs-nintendo-direct-2024">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a> is finally bringing the last unlocalized Ace Attorney game to the West, which I never dreamed would happen as a lifelong Ace Attorney fan.</p><p>My one main disappointment from this Direct is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Don’t get me wrong – I love Donkey Kong Country Returns, but I’ve already played it twice on both Wii and 3DS. Plus it’s easily the inferior Donkey Kong Country game compared to Tropical Freeze, which is already on Switch. I’m glad Nintendo hasn’t forgotten about Donkey Kong, but I’m still waiting for the first brand new Donkey Kong platformer since Tropical Freeze hit Wii U in 2014. </p><p>Still, that’s a minor quibble for a Direct that otherwise blew my expectations out of the water. And as someone who can’t stand leaker culture, I loved that none of Nintendo’s major first-party announcements got out beforehand. It gave the whole event a level of energy and mystery that was missing from some of the summer’s other big showcases, like when Sony’s big Astro Bot reveal was spoiled online days before the State of Play. Astro Bot looks incredible and I can’t wait to play it, but it takes some wind out of the sails of a big, exciting showcase when we know exactly what to expect.</p><p>The Switch has already established its reputation as one of the greatest Nintendo consoles of all time, and if the major first-party games revealed today turn out to be as good as they look, it will strengthen the argument that no other Nintendo software library can match Switch. Pulling out some of the most iconic franchises in gaming during the Switch’s eighth year on the market is quite the power move, and it puts an emphatic stamp on the most successful generation in Nintendo history. If the Switch is dying, this is one hell of a farewell tour.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Nintendo Direct June 2024 Games</h3><p>Every game featured in the Nintendo Direct on June 18, 2024.</p></div><p><em>Logan Plant is IGN's Database Manager, Playlist Editor, occasional news writer, and frequent Super Ninfriendo on Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <p>
Following the sudden cancellation of Paradox Interactive's ambitious Sims-like Life by You, the company has confirmed it's closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic.
</p>
<p>
Paradox Tectonic - the 24-person team overseen by former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs, Rod Humble - was unveiled with some fanfare back in 2019. It wasn't last March, however, that its first game, Life By You, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">officially revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the time, it seemed like a solid proposition, promising Sims-like gameplay and ambitious features including an "open game world where everything is customisable" and "real language conversation". Unfortunately, the project quickly ran into trouble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">missing its original September 2023 early access launch</a> before getting hit with a succession of further delays.

<p>
And then, after announcing an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-delays-sims-like-life-by-you-again-but-wont-commit-to-a-new-release-date">indefinite delay</a> for Life By You back in March, Paradox finally pulled the plug earlier this week, calling the project, a "clear failure... to meet both our own and the community's expectations." And with the project dead, the studio behind it has, perhaps inevitably, followed suit.
</p>
<p>
News of Paradox Tectonic's closure was shared in a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic">statement from Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester</a> on the company's website. "This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who've worked hard on Life by You's Early Access release," Wester wrote. "Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre."
</p>
<p>
Paradox's decision does, unfortunately, mean another round of job losses in what's been already devastating year for the games industry. Since the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 workers</a> have already lost their jobs across companies including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studio-deviation-games-has-closed-down">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-is-reportedly-set-to-close-roll7-and-intercept-and-sell-off-private-division">Take-Two</a> - that's more layoffs than the industry faced throughout the whole of an already grim 2023.
</p>
<p>
As for Paradox, Life By You's cancellation is just the latest in a string of high-profile disasters for the publisher - including the troubled development of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of 2023's The Lamplighters' League (resulting in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">split with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>), and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">catastrophically premature</a> launch of Cities: Skylines 2 last October. Fan confidence in Paradox's upcoming - and repeatedly delayed - Prison Architect 2 has also taken a hit following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">part ways with long-running series developer Double Eleven</a> ahead of its release, suggesting its troubles might not yet be over.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alofts-clever-cozy-survival-mechanics-impress-in-latest-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Positive vibes abound in this incredibly deep survival crafting game.</h2></div><section><p>With a focus on ecological restoration and a cool approach to exploration and crafting, Aloft shows a lot of promise as a feel-good survival-crafting game. This cozy take on the genre encourages players to glide between floating islands in the sky and fight corruption to restore their ecosystems while discovering the ruins of an ancient civilization. Notably, its first-person town-building and crafting systems seemed exceptionally deep based on my hands-off demo of the game.</p><p>In just half an hour, one of Aloft’s developers walked me through the beginning of the game and showed me in-depth tutorials for its myriad systems; so many that I’m glad I went hands-off to watch an expert at work. Nearly everything I saw seemed clever and engaging at the very least and was always framed around Aloft’s core conceit of creating a survival game with a positive, restorative message and vibe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Aloft screenshots [2024]</h3></div></output><p>Off the bat, Aloft’s setup is immediately cool: you start out on a floating island in the sky with nothing. As you work your way through the starting area, you'll eventually get a glider (think somewhere between Avatar: The Last Airbender and Breath of the Wild), and take flight to another island. Zooming from island to island looked really freeing, and developer Astrolabe Interactive made a point to incorporate systems to keep it engaging and interesting rather than just a hollow jump from one floating rock to another.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Aloft’s momentum systems fuel a lot of its moving parts. It's crucial for successfully navigating the sky.</p></div><p>Aloft’s momentum systems fuel a lot of its moving parts. It's crucial for successfully navigating the sky, and certain environmental bits like updrafts can help you gain some extra momentum—and height—as you make your way to the next island. Once you build enough momentum and land on another island, you might find yourself in a corrupted ecosystem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Overrun with mushrooms and a dense, gray-brown fog, it's immediately clear that something's not right here. You can't even harvest or mine anything from these out-of-whack biomes until you stave off the fungal corruption. Based on what I've seen, this is the only place where Aloft has combat. Using timing-based real-time systems (kind of like active reload in Gears of War) to gain small bonuses to boost your attack rate, you'll fight off small waves of goblin-like mushrooms as you attack the root of the corruption.</p><p>Clearing these tree-like fungal structures from the biome will allow you to begin restoring it. Aloft more or less tells you exactly what you need to do to help bring it back to life, which will usually involve diversifying the flora on the island by planting new plants to help improve that microcosm’s sustainability. Once it's flourishing, you can finally harvest plants from the island and you might even chance upon a helpful critter like a sheep to help produce wool.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With the right materials, you can even pitch a sail on your island. All you need is a rudder, a wheel, and a few sails to catch the wind that's constantly blowing thanks to the massive hurricane at the heart of Aloft's map. Crafting in general might be the most interesting system Aloft has going for it, in fact – especially in how you unlock new recipes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Let's say you stumble on an abandoned house with some cool furniture you haven't seen. By drawing that piece of furniture, you've suddenly unlocked its crafting recipe for your own home.</p></div><p>The first is tied to the game’s story. Stumbling upon stone frescoes left by an ancient civilization will reveal new ideas to you, teaching you how to make stuff that's important to Aloft’s story and progression. This is going to be how you unlock critical pieces like the Glider Stand or the aforementioned rudders and sails.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Next is the more traditional route, which strikes the perfect balance between leaving it up to you as the player to discover a new recipe and showing you how to make it outright. Instead of just showing you everything you can craft with an item from the get-go, small indicators will tell you whether or not you've explored every possible combination of materials without explicitly saying what those combinations will make. This seems like the perfect balance of mystery and encouragement and plays well into Aloft’s overall sense of discovery and mystery.</p><p>The last crafting method might be the coolest thing I saw in the demo. You can fill out the empty pages of a notebook by drawing things you see in the world around you. Let's say you stumble on an abandoned house with some cool furniture you haven't seen. By drawing that piece of furniture, you've suddenly unlocked its crafting recipe for your own home.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Aloft - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Like a delicate ecosystem, seemingly every system in Aloft feeds into another. Momentum from gliding can affect combat, succeeding in combat can earn you helpful crafting materials, those crafting materials can then enable you to raise sails on your island and fly it into a storm to help water your crops. With so many systems at play, all coming together with impressive cohesion, it's hard to believe that Aloft is still in Early Access. I'm really interested to see how this interconnecting web of systems and ideas continues to evolve as the game expands beyond its current state.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has been slowly revitalizing the SaGa series over the past few years, and the RPG franchise's next big release is Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven. The game is a ground-up remake of Romancing SaGa 2, which originally launched on the Super Famicom in 1993. An HD port of the original was also released in 2017, but this new remake version reimagines the game in full 3D and overhauls the battle system to match the new "timeline" system featured in recent titles like SaGa Emerald Beyond. There are also a few quality of life updates to make the game more approachable for new players, including new difficulty options.</p><p dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven launches on <strong>October 24</strong> for PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, and preorders are available now. You can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fromancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fromancing-saga-2-remake-preorder-guide-ps5-switch-pc%2F1100-6524385%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder a Steam key for $42.49 at Green Man Gaming with promo code JUNE15</a></strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4321024-sagapreorderbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321024" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4321024-sagapreorderbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321024"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4321024-sagapreorderbonus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you preorder Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, you'll get two bonus in-game items that boost your character's growth. These items will not be available in the base game at launch, so if you want them, you'll have to preorder.</p><p>While the series started as a Final Fantasy spin-off called Final Fantasy Legend, the SaGa series quickly evolved into its own unique franchise. Unlike many other JRPGs of the 90s, the SaGa games are notable for offering non-linear storylines and complex character building systems that were more akin to 90s computer RPGs. Romancing SaGa 2 sees players take the role of various members of a royal family as they fight to maintain their empire, and stave off world-ending threats. There's also an entire castle building mechanics where you construct and manage fortresses around your kingdom. Like other games in the series, where you go, who you talk to, and which side quests you complete can have drastic changes on how the story unfolds. It's a surprisingly open-ended experience, even by modern standards, and this new remake is the perfect opportunity to give it a go, or revisit it and try for an entirely different story path.</p><p dir="ltr">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven looks to be a great way to jump into the SaGa series, but plenty of other games in the series are available to buy now. The latest all-new release is SaGa: Emerald Beyond, but other titles like Romancing SaGa: Minstrel's Song Remastered, Collection of SaGa: Final Fantasy Legend, and more are also available and are worth checking out if you're curious about this cult-favorite JRPG series. These games are only available in digital format. PC players can grab the Steam versions at GMG.

<p data-characters="341" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warframe</em> just dropped a new update, and with it, a ton of new items to farm away for and story beats to follow before the MMO’s big event later this summer. The <em>Jade Shadows</em> questline is the latest added in <em>Warframe</em>, and if you’re floundering with the new choices presented along the journey, we’ve got explainers to help. </p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Stop here now for everything beyond will be spoilers related to the new quest involving the Stalker and Jade.</em></strong></p> <h2 id="h-should-you-name-the-baby-sirius-or-orion-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Should you name the baby Sirius or Orion in <em>Warframe</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">After being spared by the overwhelming barrage of shots, the Stalker escapes, with his child in his arms. Not yet named, you, the player, are now tasked with naming the child. So, do you name them Sirius or Orion?</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><strong>Picking Sirius</strong> would mean that the baby will take more after its mother. Since she has passed, it would be a nod to her legacy. You’ll notice if you hover over the name and see the green, obviously referring to the energy colors of Jade.</p>
 <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false"><strong>Picking Orion</strong> would imply that the baby will take more after the Stalker (now known as Sorren).

All choices made like this in the game<em> </em>only make the experience spiritually different, but the outcome will always be the same.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">This is similar to the whole Sun and Moon system when making pivotal choices in the mainline quests. Usually, the Sun option means to take the more noble and morally correct paths. Moon leans more towards a darker, brutal path. There are occasionally neutral paths, so you have a balance between the two.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">In the case of Sirius and Orion, it’s one side or the other. Where this will lead to in the future is still to be known. What kind of role this will play if The Stalker’s storyline continues will be interesting, knowing now that he has had a huge development of character in<em> Jade Shadows.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-combat-abilities-skill-tree-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you're at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_origins/b/pc/archive/2009/10/05/review.aspx">Dragon Age: Origins'</a> real-time strategy RPG approach to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_ii/b/xbox360/archive/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-console-review-amid-improvements-bioware-leaves-story-behind.aspx#:~:text=No%20longer%20trying%20to%20straddle,it%20suits%20the%20game%20well.">Dragon Age II's</a> mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_inquisition/b/playstation4/archive/2014/11/10/dragon-age-inquisition-review-game-informer.aspx">Dragon Age: Inquisition's</a> strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/DragonAgeTheVeilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground for Dragon Age combat. Of course, it's hard to tell how Veilguard's action will hold up over what is sure to be a dozens-of-hours-long RPG, but if what I've seen so far is any indication, the studio is on to something.</p>

<h2>A Shift In Strategy</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0a68d9ad-db75-4ac9-9b0c-8105011dcc80" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>"I think the first thing to keep in mind is that combat [...] in the franchise has been an evolution," game director Corinne Busche tells me within BioWare's Edmonton office. "Every single entry reimagines what combat is like and I would say our goal was to make sure we had a system that allowed players to feel like they actually were able to step into the world of Thedas. They're not a player observing from afar – they are inside of this world. Being this authentic world that's brought to life, the combat system needs to support that, so you are in control of every single action, every block, every dodge, every swing of your sword."</p>

<p>Busche says players complete every swing in real-time, with particular attention paid to animation swing-through and canceling. On the topic of canceling, I watch Busche "bookmark" combos with a quick dash. With this mechanic, players can pause a combo's status with a dash to safety and continue the combo where they left off afterward. Alongside the dash, there's a parry for some classes, the ability to charge moves, and a revamped healing system that allows players to quickly use potions by pressing right on the d-pad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Busche says each character will play the same in a way, regardless of class, in that you execute light and heavy attacks with the same buttons, use abilities with the same buttons, and interact with the combo wheel in the same way. During my demo at one point, we use a sword-and-shield Warrior Qunari that hip-fires and aims their shield to throw it like Captain America while hammering down big damage with a sword. Pressing the same buttons as a mage might throw out magical ranged attacks instead of a shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Abilities, like a Spartan-like kick from a Warrior or a Mage's firewall that deals continuous damage, add to the player's repertoire of combat options. Warriors can parry incoming attacks, staggering enemies in the process. Rogues have a larger parry window, and Mages can't parry at all but instead throw up a shield that blocks all incoming damage so long as they have the mana to sustain the shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That is just the baseline that allows us to get that level of immersion of, 'I'm actually in this world; I'm a part of it,'" Busche says. "But again, the abilities, the strategy, linking my companions' abilities together to perform devastating combos, that is really where the depth and the complexity comes into play."</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;Warrior Rook Skill Tree&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fbcf4084-cb82-4d2a-b0e9-5f8394b4ebc5" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>





<p>Warrior Rook Skill Tree</p>

</article><p>This extends to companions, who, at your choosing, bring three abilities (of their five total) into combat, executed either with quick select buttons or the pause-and-play combat wheel. Every time you rank up a companion's Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion – this is how you unlock new combat abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though companion skill trees pale in comparison to Rook's expansive tree, which features passive abilities, combat abilities, and more, as well as paths to three unique class specializations, there's still some customization here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can find the skill tree for Rook and companions within Veilguard's start or pause menu. This menu contains pages for Veilguard's map, journal, character sheets, and a library for lore information, too. Here, you can cross-compare equipment and equip new gear for Rook and companions, build weapon loadouts, and customize your abilities and builds via the aforementioned skill tree, which looks relatively easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won't find minutiae here, "just real numbers," Busche says. In other words, a new unlocked trait might increase damage by 25% against armor, but that's as in-depth as the numbers get. Passive abilities unlock jump attacks and guarantee critical hit opportunities, while abilities add moves like firewall and spartan kicks to your arsenal. As you spec out this skill tree, which is 100% bespoke to each class, you'll work closer to unlocking a specialization (which doesn't take reaching the max level of 50). Every class has three specializations, each with a unique ultimate ability. Busche says BioWare's philosophy with the skill tree is "about changing the way you play, not the statistical minutiae."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Companions In Combat</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="19d2c27c-cd9d-45f4-b860-def974c9adca" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>If you completely ignore companions in combat, they will attack targets, use abilities, and defeat enemies all on their own. "[Companions] are their own people, "Busche says. "They have their own behaviors, they have their own autonomy on the battlefield, they'll pick their own targets. As their plots progress, they'll learn how to use their abilities more competently, and it really feels like you're fighting alongside these realized characters in battle."</p>

<p>Speaking to companion synergy, Busche adds, "I see all the abilities Harding has, and I see everything that Bellara is capable of. And sometimes, I'm using vulnerabilities synergistically. Maybe I'm pausing or slowing time with Bellara so that I can unleash devastating attacks with Harding, knocking down the enemy, and then me, as Rook, I'm rushing in and capitalizing on this setup they've created for me. It is a game about creating this organic sense of teamwork."</p>

<p>Busche says there are more explicit synergies, with intentional combos where specific companions can play off each other, and you can queue up their abilities to do just that. That’s what the pause-and-play combat wheel is for in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this screen, which pauses the camera and pulls up a flashy combat wheel that highlights you and your companions' skills, you can choose abilities, queue them up, and strategize with synergies and combos the game recognizes, all while targeting specific enemies. Select what you want and release the wheel to watch your selections play out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e5156987-c749-4b55-a850-e154a57b4fea" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>During a mission within Arlathan Forest after Veilguard's prologue, Busche utilizes Veilguard's dual-loadout mechanic. As Rook, you can create two weapon loadouts for quick switch-ups mid-combat. As a mage Rook, she uses magical attacks to add three stacks of arcane build-up to make an Arcane Bomb on a Sentinel, a mechanical set of armor possessed by a demon. If you hit the Sentinel's Arcane Bomb with a heavy attack, the enemy will take devastating damage. Once the Sentinel has an Arcane Bomb on it, Busche begins charging a heavy attack on her magical staff, then switches to magical daggers in Rook's second loadout, accessed with a quick tap of down on the d-pad to unleash some quick light attacks, then back to the staff to finish charging its attack. She then unleashes the heavy attack, and the Arcane Bomb explodes in a liquidy whirl of green magic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've seen [Veilguard's combat] refined over time [and] I love it," BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me. "I love that balance of real-time fluid action, but also the ability to have the depth in the RPG, not just in terms of pause-and-play, but the depth in terms of how you bring your companions into the battlefield. What are you going to do with their skill points? What's the loadout you're going to use? Everything is about bringing Rook to the center of the battlefield, and I love it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Dragon Age executive producer and Veilguard consultant Mark Darrah feels Veilguard is the first game where the combat is legitimately fun. "What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap," he says. "Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get the sense from watching Busche play several hours of Veilguard that BioWare has designed a combat system that relies heavily on players extracting what they want out of it. If you want to button mash and use abilities freely when their cooldowns expire, you can probably progress fine (although on the game's easier difficulties). But if you want to strategize your combos, take advantage of elemental vulnerabilities, and min-max companions and Rook loadouts, you can do that, too, and I think you'll find Veilguard rewards that with a more enriching experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="187" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since <em>XDefian</em>t first launched, players have been begging for Team Deathmatch to be added as a game mode. An overwhelming wave of demand worked, as Ubisoft finally confirmed its addition. </p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1803118032207634816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Team Deathmatch goes live as a new game mode on June 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Playing the objective is fun and often rewarding when it leads to a victory for your team. However, sometimes, when you log on, you would rather turn your brain off and strictly go after enemies. Team Deathmatch is the perfect game mode for players seeking out that experience. </p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">Team Deathmatch is a classic first-person shooter game mode in which the only objective is to get as many kills as possible. The winner of the match is the team that reaches the point limit first or the squad that has the most kills at the end of the time limit. As in the case with other titles such as <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, this game mode will probably be one of the most played game modes when it goes live. </p>

Arena environments are designed for game modes like Occupy and Hot Shot, as they are smaller and ideal for fast-paced battles. On the other hand, liner maps are more tailored for modes like Escort and Zone Control because the game modes demand a larger battlefield. Ubisoft did not reveal which maps the game mode will be available on, but it will most likely only be available on arena maps, based on the criteria. </p>
 <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="170" data-injectable="false">As for other highly requested game modes, <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin previously <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> on June 5 that Search and Destroy will be added in a future update. </p>

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nintendo announced the phenomenal-looking <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> during its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-in-the-nintendo-direct-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>. Alongside that announcement, the company also casually dropped a reveal for the beautiful Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition. </p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">This console is a special edition of the Nintendo Switch Lite, possibly the best ever made. In the past, we’ve had slight variations on the design, the most recent of which was for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-crossing-new-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, but only the <em>Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em> and <em>Sword and Shield</em> <em>Editions</em> really went anywhere with their designs. The Hyrule Edition kicks things up a notch with a striking look for what looks to be an amazing game. </p>

It’s impossible to say when pre-orders for the console will go live, but based on how previous special edition pre-order dates have worked, it should be a couple of months before the release date. </p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Registering your interest doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get to pre-order the console.

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft expedited <em>XDefiant’s</em> weapon leveling process by decreasing the XP requirement. However, to maintain player engagement, the development team made the weapon mastery unlock process harder, dividing players. </p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-june-18-patch-notes-faster-weapon-leveling-improved-netcode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 18 <em>XDefiant</em> update,</a> Ubisoft lowered the XP needed to level up a primary weapon from 3.500 to 3,000 and a secondary weapon from 1,500 to 1,000. As a counterbalance, the Bronze camo level was increased from 50 to 100, Silver from 75 to 150, and Gold from 100 to 200. </p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">Previously, <em>XDefiant</em> developer Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price <a href="http://Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> that one kill equals 100 XP, meaning it took around 35 kills per level. Considering that there are 18 primary weapons and all attachments aren’t unlocked until level 43, that’s a steep undertaking for a player of any skill level. Multiple double XP weekends have helped aid the cause, but it wasn’t enough to satisfy a growingly frustrated player base. </p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin stepped in and <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1803068682479800737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that players were unlocking attachments slower than originally intended, so this update should make it easier. But it’s the weapon mastery re-balancing that’s raised eyebrows.<em> XDefiant </em>content creator NerosCinema argued that the update makes no sense because while the it’s nice that you can unlock attachments for primary weapons 14 percent faster, doubling the level requirement for mastery camos is too harsh of a change. </p>

And so the re-balance of levels was in response to that.” </p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">14 percent will make a substantial difference, and that will be even more noticeable on double XP weekends moving forward. But asking players to reach level 200 on every weapon instead of 100 is a tall order and possibly too harsh of an ask. Players who have already unlocked all three mastery camos for a weapon won’t lose them, but it’s also not necessarily fair that players who missed out now have to work twice as hard for the achievement. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Another issue is players only get weapon XP from kills. As a result, players don’t get rewarded for playing the objective, which leads to users only hunting kills. Thankfully, this update is retroactive, meaning every player will have higher weapon levels than before. But it’s clear that the system still needs work, and players aren’t fully satisfied. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> already has in-development DLCs which will see its 18-wheelers head to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/american-truck-simulators-arkansas-dlc-is-under-development">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/american-truck-simulators-next-expansion-takes-the-truck-sim-to-missouri">Missouri</a>, but SCS Software have also commenced building a third: Iowa.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/5956653982594462600">announcement on Steam</a> chatters about the sights on offer within the state, from the capital Des Moines to the scenic views of the Mississippi River. It also notes that while "Iowa isn't the biggest State in the USA, it is certainly home to a lot of 'The World's Biggest...' You'll find plenty of interesting landmarks on your journey." 
</p>
<p>Naturally I had to Google this, and I have learned that Iowa is home to the largest: garden gnome, bull statue, starberry statue, and Cheeto (not a statue). I hope every single one of these is present in the game, even if the Cheeto is technically too small to see from your cab window.
</p>
<p>You will, of course, also drive past a lot of corn fields. Those are my abiding memory of riding across Iowa on a train fifteen or so years ago.
</p>
<p>There's no release date for the expansion yet - those tend to come very near to release, and I'd imagine Arkansas and Missouri will see daylight first. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025440/American_Truck_Simulator__Iowa/">more screenshots over on Steam, though</a>.</p>

<p id="0nVEZ4"><strong>The exception is the United States</strong> where, once it hits midnight local time on the east coast, the DLC will go live on console for the whole country (meaning those of you on the west coast will be able to play as of 9 p.m. PDT on June 20).</p>
<h3 id="BlNV1X"><strong>Elden Ring DLC PC release time</strong></h3>
<p id="XXzVP7">Meanwhile, on Windows PC, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em><strong>launches midnight CEST on Friday, June 21 </strong>at the same time around the world.<strong> </strong>Here’s when that is in your time zone:</p>

<p id="NLAH2v">As described in Polygon’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> preview</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">initial impressions</a>, the DLC is fundamentally “more <em>Elden Ring</em>.” For the most part, that means: sprawling dungeons, relentless enemies, and a vast sense of discovery.</p>
<p id="dTrj1I">For one thing, according to our preview, the expansion is significantly more difficult than the base game. There are new types of collectibles in the mix (including power-ups called Scadutree Fragments). Narratively, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> focuses on Miquella, whom you may know as the brother of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24176307/malenia-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat">Malenia</a>, one of the most notorious boss fights from the base game.</p>

Zero, the upcoming installment in the beloved anime arena fighter, is poised to be one of the biggest video game releases for diehard Dragon Ball fans. Just when the game felt like it couldn’t be any more of a love letter to the series, a voice actor from the anime seemingly confirmed that one of the most underappreciated Super Saiyan forms would be making its way to the game as well. </p><p>During a Dragon Ball Z cast panel at Anime Riverside 2024, longtime Goku voice actor Sean Schemmel discussed the challenge of voicing different characters in the series and giving them their own unique voice. In a video <a href="https://youtu.be/pGeH0eFzy6A?t=684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>uploaded to YouTube by JimmyisaGeek</u></a>, Schemmel seemingly let it slip that Super Saiyan 4 Goku will be playable in Sparking! Zero. </p><p>“I didn’t realize that subtly changing the voice for every single form was gonna bite me in the ass later, and so keeping track of all that for like Super Saiyan 4, Super Saiyan 3, God mode, Red, was all real subtle,” Schemmel said. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO News, Posts &amp; Fan Hub (@DBSparkingZER0) <a href="https://twitter.com/DBSparkingZER0/status/1802947580206129383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Schemmel credits Damon Mills, the voice actor for Frieza, for helping him keep track of Goku’s Super Saiyan voices on "this last game we’ve been working on.” While Schemmel could be speaking about any Dragon Ball game, there’s a high probability he’s talking about Sparking Zero, seeing as how Mills <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1733988353119551659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>serves as the game’s lead voice director</u></a>.</p><p>“Damon has been on top of keeping all my references in line. Going through making sure everything’s right. Really nitpicking it. It’s a very challenging thing to do, but it's really easy so long as you keep vocal references around because the second I can hear it, I can do it,” Schemmel said.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/vs-youtube-dragonballgt-gokussj4hdaiupscale-117-1718740736357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Super Saiyan 4 Goku in Dragon Ball GT.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Super Saiyan 4, developed by Toei Animation character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru, is one of the most visually unique designs in the Dragon Ball mythos. Contrary to other Super Saiyan forms, which see a color and length change for their Saiyan warriors, Super Saiyan 4 leans in on the Great ape design from OG Dragon Ball by giving its heroes colored fur and a tail. Super Saiyan 4 is also considered the best thing to come out of Dragon Ball’s universally reviled sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, among longtime fans. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Prior to Schemmel seemingly spilling the senzu beans about Super Saiyan 4, fans were hard at work <a href="https://x.com/Burcol/status/1802827785679065270?t=nxhZ0x9dD2EI3d8PfAgQ8A&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeze-framing blurry microscopic shots</a> from the latest Sparking!

Zero’s sizeable roster</a>, it could also indicate other super Saiyan 4 characters like Vegeta and Gogeta making their way to the fighter as well. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-like-controlling-a-battle-from-the-anime"><u>our preview</u></a> for Sparking! Zero, we praised the game for feeling like its battles were lifted right out of the anime, saying, “Even after just a dozen or so matches against the CPU, it became clear to me that Dragon Ball superfans who are exceptionally good at fighting games – or those who intend to practice a lot with Sparking Zero – are going to find themselves having a great time crushing their competition.”</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is slated to launch on October 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

The point-to-point action is a pure first-person shooter. You will be deployed into a few abandoned acres of countryside—similar to the ghost towns of Urzikstan or Erangel—and be asked to shoot your way towards extraction with as much loot as possible in tow. Of course, once you and your friends return to the main menu and have converted all of that booty into cold hard cash, you'll be confronted with Arena Breakout's vast marketplace, gleaming with cosmetics, firearm attachments, or even just a few extra clips of ammunition. It aims to be a game about getting rich and staying rich when one stray headshot might take it all away. </p><p>Arena Breakout aims to be a steely military simulator, with no Call of Duty-style acrobatics or titanic Battlefield set pieces. You craft a grim soldier in the character creator and outfit them with a knapsack of survival gear, which all needs to fit, like Tetris blocks, within your limited inventory. (Generally speaking, you'll be bringing body armor, a backpack, a wealth of food and medical supplies, and yes, lots and lots of ammunition.) Over the course of a match, our hero may grow hungry, or thirsty, or need the bullet in their arm to be removed. With luck, you will have brought the perfect antidote for all of those tasks, avoiding an untimely end to the campaign. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Arena Breakout: Infinite Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In that sense, Arena Breakout might remind you of the venerable survival-sim DayZ, where the player's marching orders are to hunker down and survive for as long as they can until the zombies inevitably come for their brains. But instead of an inevitable dirge towards destruction, Arena Breakout instead partitions its matches into 30 minute chunks, where our job is to gather a whole bunch of loot locked away in safes and coffers around the map before heading towards an extraction point to get out of Dodge. It's a formula that adds a good amount of flexibility for playstyles—both the maniacs and the campers will have plenty to love.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arena Breakout looked categorically gorgeous on my four-year old PC.</p></div><p>It also certainly helps that Arena Breakout looked categorically gorgeous on my four-year old PC. Infinite is developed by Level Infinite and is a spinoff of a hugely popular mobile shooter with the same name. Going in, I expected a good amount of iPhone jank interfering with the action. But that wasn't the case at all. The maps here are finely detailed and rich with exploitable angles and coverage, and the total draw distance rivals what you might find in more prominent open-world multiplayer shooters. But most impressive of all might be the gun-nut obsessiveness with which you can customize a whole range of firearms to meet your exact build. Shotguns, bolt-action rifles, machine guns, pistols, all completely modular and malleable—and all rendered beautifully when protruding from the bottom of your screen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Arena Breakout is PvPvE, which is to say that in each match you play, you'll be finding a swathe of easily dispatchable bots bumbling around the outskirts of certain important chokepoints. (You'll take them down with ease, but don't expect them to be carrying much loot.) I like that Infinite always provides us with something to shoot at, considering this sort of shooter formula can get bogged down in the doldrums pretty quickly. Furthermore, the marketplace, where you offload your riches, is a game unto itself. Every item in the Arena Breakout inventory seems to hinge on a sliding scale of supply and demand. Did you spend most of your time in World of Warcraft being a shark at the Orgrimmar auction house? Well, we certainly have a shooter for you.</p><p>But this also gets to my only real anxiety about Infinite as it stands. Arena Breakout is about scoring loot, and ratcheting up thresholds of lethal material, turning your character into a progressively more effective killing machine. But some of those gearing thresholds are punitive. Superior ammunition tiers are necessary for penetrating stronger armor, so to stay ahead of the curve, players are incentivized to dump a lot of time and effort into their extraction runs. Will that grind grow punitive over time? Especially when all it takes is one unlucky ambush for you to lose everything you're carrying? So far, I've enjoyed walking the tightrope that Arena Breakout is stringing out for us. Let's just hope we don't fall off.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Less than a day after publisher Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-by-you-canceled-after-being-indefinitely-delayed-a-month-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled <em>Life by You</em></a>, the company announced that the game’s developer Paradox Tectonic <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is shutting down</a>.</p> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">The news was delivered earlier this morning by the publisher. Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, called the move, which affects 24 people, “difficult and drastic,” and shutting down the studio was a “tough decision.” </p> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on <em>Life by You</em>’s Early Access release,” Wester said. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.”</p>

In a quote, Wester said the game would not meet expectations: “A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release<em>.</em>” The decision resulted in an estimated $19.8 million write-down for the company, which has seen other trouble as of late. Last year, the company announced it would write down <em>The Lamplighters League</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/paradox-is-taking-a-write-down-on-the-lamplighters-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for approximately $23 million</a> a week after the game launched. </p>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="false">It has been troubling all around. Paradox Tectonic’s shuttering feels like another stone in the road for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/deus-exs-adam-jensen-gives-heartfelt-thanks-to-fans-amidst-eidos-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an industry</a> that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-confirms-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already</a> experienced <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-executives-earned-60m-last-fiscal-year-despite-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of job loss</a> in 2024 — and we’re only halfway through the year. Just yesterday, before the news of the <em>Life by You </em>cancellation, Embracer Group announced the closure of <em>Alone in the Dark</em> (2024) <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-kills-yet-another-studio-after-its-alone-in-the-dark-remake-underperformed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer Pieces Interactive</a>. Microsoft closed down the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin (along with Alpha Dog Games) ahead of its big June showcase. Needless to say, the move <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dampened the excitement</a> before the show. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch is on its last legs, with a successor lurking in its shadow to such a degree that Nintendo has felt the need to repeatedly inform people that it won’t be present at events like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today’s Nintendo Direct</a>. But you wouldn’t have known it from watching, well, today’s Nintendo Direct: If the original Switch is going down, it’s going down swinging. A new <em>Zelda </em>where you (finally) play as Zelda and the long-awaited re-reveal of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> grabbed headlines, but the Switch’s dying gasp has breadth. In this regard, Nintendo continues to buck industry trends and go its own way. Good!&nbsp;</p><p>Last week I wrote about my <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-showcase-summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of enthusiasm</a> toward Microsoft’s bench of tired franchises, and there’s no denying that Nintendo <em>loves</em> a time-honored franchise. Zelda and Samus predate Marcus Fenix and Fable He/She/They by multiple decades. But Nintendo’s great strength is that it maintains a keen sense of when to Get (Economically) Weird With It. While <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is long overdue, it’s otherwise a great example of this: The game is built from the same foundation as the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> remake, but it’s got a new main character and central mechanic to match. I, for one, cannot wait to <a href="https://x.com/HarrisFoster/status/1803074649325973714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">table</a> Ganon to death.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is similar. It’s not a mainline series entry – I’m sure Nintendo is saving that for the Switch 2 – but it continues a role-playing side saga that other companies would do well to learn from if they insist on going back to the same franchise wells time and time again. Let characters explore additional genres and worlds. Make games both large and small. Vary players’ diets. Man cannot live on triple-A tentpoles alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, of course, there’s <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which was honestly the least exciting part of the showcase to me. It looked fine! I guess I just expected more after years of waiting and a slightly worrisome <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/metroid-prime-4-development-restarting-from-the-beginning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development reboot in 2019</a>. But it exists. And rather than saving it for the Switch 2, Nintendo is letting it serve as the original Switch’s swan song in 2025, with an impressively stacked 2024 lineup getting the crowd warmed up for it. I’ve yet to even mention <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, <em>Pokemon Legends Z-A</em>, and a whole host of third-party gems like<em> Fantasian: Neo Dimension</em>, <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, Romancing Saga 2</em>, and the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake, most of which are coming out this year or early next.&nbsp;</p><p>I will readily admit my biases here: I’m grading on a curve since one would typically expect far less than this from a console near the end of its life, and I also like RPGs. Even so, this is a strong procession of games that are all coming soon. I’m not always certain if I was correct to buy a PlayStation 5, and I doubt I’ll ever pick up an Xbox Series X, but I know exactly what I’m going to be playing on my Nintendo Switch in the near future. That kind of consistency is an underrated quality, one that’s easy to take for granted. Not only that, but Nintendo has maintained it over the course of the Switch’s entire life cycle. Despite being seven years old, my Switch has never collected dust.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo knows what works for it, and over the years it has stayed that course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at times to its own detriment</a>. But when it works, it really works. The Switch has been a smash success, which has allowed Nintendo to stick to its guns even as it navigates an industry that’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling down on fewer, bigger games</a>. It is notable that Nintendo hasn’t laid off hundreds or thousands of workers in the past couple years, nor has it jumped aboard the forever game bandwagon (unless<em> Mario Kart 8</em> counts). I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that the former is <a href="https://x.com/haleyfax/status/1803052670611038472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a result of labor law</a> as much as it is anything else, but there’s also a hopeful truth at the core of Nintendo’s approach: If you create something good and dependable, people will appreciate it. You don’t have to trick or trap them to build a successful business.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, they’ll keep coming back. Nintendo doesn’t need to sink a frankly horrifying amount of time and manpower into a microtransaction-powered live service game because it has continually reached beyond the audience that would even play such a thing and given kids, adults, and just about every other imaginable demographic a bunch of friendly, imaginative experiences. Could another company pull this off without literally owning Mario, the Mickey Mouse of video games? I don’t know. But I’m glad Nintendo’s doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now please stop <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-citra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sicking your lawyers on emulators and fan projects</a>.

This all takes place in a persistent open world called Solisium, where dynamic, interactive environments affect the gameplay in meaningful ways. Unpredictable weather cycles impact how your weapons perform, alter the terrain around you, and reveal new access points. While exploring the world, players will be able to transform into creatures that fly through the air or take to the sea for rapid travel, or even morph into defeated bosses to turn the tide in battle.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The most recent iteration, Galactic Sports, was a Vita exclusive that never made it out of PAL regions, so it's nice to see a new family-friendly arcade sports game in the pipeline.</p><p dir="ltr">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports will feature a collection of mini-games based on basketball, soccer, golf, and tennis, but with unique gameplay twists like powerups and special moves. The game includes solo and multiplayer modes, and each player will be able to control iconic Looney Tunes characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and more. Unsurprisingly, Wacky World of Sports is reminiscent of Mario sports games, such as the Wii's Mario Sports Mix and 3DS' Mario Sports Superstars as well the entries on Switch: <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Mario-Golf-Super-Rush-Nintendo-Switch-Games%2F432567681%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Golf: Super Rush</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1806410424423360561%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch%2F725662018%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you enjoy Mario sports games and like Looney Tunes--or are simply sad Mario Hoops 3-on-3 never received a sequel--you can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1845486187299003978%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports</a></strong> now on consoles.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports Preorder Bonus</h2><p dir="ltr">No Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports preorder bonuses have been announced yet.</p><div title="6524382 -

            <p>Classic RPG Dragon Quest 3 is getting a remake in Square Enix's now familiar HD-2D style, which blends high-resolution 2D sprites together with 3D worlds. It'll land on November 14th. "<em>Waitaminute</em>," you might be saying, "Shouldn't they remake the first two games beforehand?" No, you numpty, you nyaff, you roaster; within the internal chronology of Dragon Quest, 3 comes first.
</p>
<p>Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

<p>The tease for DQI and DQII comes right at the very end of the above trailer, and the three games together form what Square Enix are calling the Erdrick trilogy. 
</p>
<p>The remake was announced all the way back in 2021 for the series' 35th anniversary, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-dragon-quest-12">alongside the announcement of Dragon Quest 12</a>, the next mainline game in the series. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's been seen since, although its re-appearance today isn't entirely a surprise, either. Square Enix teased its appearance in a tweet on 'Dragon Quest day' - May 27th, the release date of the original game in Japan in 1986. "The legend of Erdrick draws near," read <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347">the post</a>.
</p>
<p>I have not played any Dragon Quest game other than a tiny bit of DQ11, but that makes me more interested in the remakes, not less, because it feels like an opportunity to rectify my ignorance of the series. Aside from the updated graphics, Square Enix are promising that the HD-2D release will have "an improved and modernized UI, and other quality of life improvements," when it arrives later this year <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3awZkz">It’s big, big news that in the Zelda game announced during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Tuesday’s Nintendo Direct</a><em> — </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — players will assume control of Princess Zelda rather than Link. It’s the first time in history you’ll be able to play a full game as the title character (unless you count the notably terrible CD-i games, which director Eiji Aonuma <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/ptkydm/eiji-aonuma-addresses-those-horrible-zelda-cd-i-games">doesn’t consider canon</a>). But there’s one key point of intrigue: In <em>Echoes</em>, Aonuma said Zelda doesn’t fight with a sword — ever.</p>
<p id="YHSBwc">Some longtime players, like myself, might find Zelda’s lack of a sword a bit disappointing initially. After all, she does have several swords in her possession at various points in the series: Zelda’s sword from <em>Twilight Princess </em>is definitively hers; she wields rapiers in the Hyrule Warriors games; and in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, she hangs on to the Master Sword to protect it while Link takes a 100-year nap. Usually, like Zelda herself, these weapons only appear in cutscenes and other cinematics, and it’s only in a few moments that we see her defend herself using a sword.</p>

<p id="zUHSOj">But I have a hunch that it isn’t just her character’s canon that kept Aonuma from giving her a sword in <em>Echoes</em>. Sure, it’s true that some aspects of other Zelda tales would fall apart if suddenly Zelda were a master of swordplay. In <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, for instance, she uses the harp rather than a more traditional weapon when she’s disguised as Sheik. And she certainly can’t use the Master Sword, which famously only works if Link wields it.</p>
<p id="PzBMlo">That said, it also serves <em>Echoes</em>’ gameplay — and the potential for future games that include both Link and Zelda as playable characters — for the heroine to ditch swordsmanship for this game. The decision puts a clear distinction between Zelda’s mission to harness the “power of her wisdom” and Link’s frequent quest to find varied weapons and, eventually, the Master Sword. </p>
<p id="q7HNdV">According to the Nintendo Direct, Zelda’s character will use a wand to wield the Echo power, which she can use to duplicate items in the game environment to solve puzzles and battle enemies. (Polygon senior editor Oli Welsh pointed out in our internal Slack that this mechanic is essentially Ultrahand from <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em>) Players can use Echo to copy a table or a trampoline, for instance, and paste those items in the world when they need them to hop over walls or climb a tower.</p>
<p id="F88I5I">Zelda’s Echo reminds me of the masks in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, or even the Fuse power in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> — mechanics that allow the player to solve a given puzzle in several ways, even if those methods aren’t necessarily predetermined by the developer (i.e., fusing a bunch of wooden slats together to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">make a bridge</a> to get across a chasm). Particularly during the months following the release of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, tons of players considered their solutions to be outside of what the developers intended — and indeed, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/24001489/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-developer-interview">Aonuma told Polygon</a>, “I was surprised to see what people have gotten up to in the game. [...] It’s something that kind of blew my mind. I mean, there are limits to how many objects you can put together. But people really rushed to find out what those limits were, and that was surprising to me.”</p>

<p id="bcLoSK">The trailer for <em>Echoes</em> included a clip of Zelda stacking several water cubes, then stepping into them to float to the top, where she steps out onto a previously inaccessible area. It’s gameplay like that that makes me fully trust Nintendo’s decision to keep Zelda swordless. In <em>Echoes</em>, she has the power to replicate items she can use to defend herself, not to mention that she can duplicate enemies and use them to fight on her behalf (like any good princess should).</p>
<p id="uQRL6C">In all, Zelda’s swordless-ness does not seem to be a ploy to keep her less powerful or more dainty than Link — instead, it’s a reminder that the franchise isn’t only about the Master Sword. Moreover, it’s a reminder that Zelda’s greatest power is her intellect, which she uses time and again throughout the franchise to trick enemies, empower her friends, and lead with compassion. </p>

You see, despite Zelda being the namesake of the series, Link has been the protagonist of most of the franchise. For a long time, fans have hoped for a Zelda-led title that would reverse their roles, making it so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-trailer-release-date-link-1851546323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-trailer-release-date-link-1851546323">Link is the one being saved by Zelda</a></span>. This hypothetical game’s name: why, <em>The Legend of Link</em>, of course.</p><p>In their excitement, many took to Twitter to jokingly declare that Nintendo <em>obviously </em>got the name of the game wrong. Others have taken the opportunity to show off their own fan art of the concept of a Zelda-led game.</p><p>And then there’s this big brain play.<br></p><p>As fun as it is to ponder why Nintendo didn’t actually go forward with the joke, there are two very likely reasons. The first is that Nintendo’s developers may be so detached from the internet and all the jokes we make on there that it never seriously crossed anyone’s mind. Nintendo is known for actually retaining its staff, which is why there are so many senior folks there that have worked on some of these franchises for literal decades, like Aonuma. They probably don’t pay all the chatter online any mind, and hey, good for them.<br></p><p>The more likely case is that it absolutely did come up at some point, but in order to keep the brand intact, they went forward with the <em>Legend of Zelda </em>moniker. Also, the last time there was a Zelda-led game that changed up the naming scheme…it kind of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%27s_Adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%27s_Adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sucked</a></span>.<br></p><p>As funny as <em>The Legend of Link</em> is, it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue in the same way. Though you and I may be certain it isn’t confusing, there are other more casual gamers and purchasers who might be thrown for a loop by the sudden name change. There are already people who think Link is named Zelda because he’s the hero of the games, so naming the Zelda-led game after Link might give someone an aneurysm. Much as I hate it, it’s just simpler this way, but <em>The Legend of Link</em> shall live on in all our hearts and minds. And Twitter now, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
