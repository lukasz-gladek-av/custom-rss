		<p>As pioneering as the Nintendo Switch was in 2017, its hybrid design enabling a much fuller console experience than most handhelds had managed in the past, and laying the foundations for handheld PCs that have flourished in the last few years, the simple fact of is that its adapted mobile chipset was barely powerful enough for most modern games. This gave rise to a slew of “impossible” ports to the console, from Doom to The Witcher 3, while even Switch exclusives could end up seriously compromised.</p>
<p>But now here’s the Switch 2, and just as we’ve seen with Sony and Microsoft’s consoles since 2016, there’s so much potential for the Switch 1’s back catalogue to run better on the new hardware. This comes in a number of forms, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">paid Switch 2 Editions</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-12-free-switch-2-game-updates-resolution-frame-rate-hdr-gameshare/">free patches</a>, and then just running basic Switch 1 game code on a more powerful system.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Switch 2 Backward Compatibility fixes a lot of bad Switch frame rates" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds3mP6OMM9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s this final category that I find particularly interesting and the focus for today. Despite both systems having ARM CPU cores and an Nvidia GPU, there’s enough difference in the hardware such that the Switch 2 doesn’t run Switch 1 games natively. It’s not emulation either, but is instead running Switch 1 games through a translation layer that remaps CPU and GPU calls to the new architecture. It’s the same methodology that allows Windows games to run in Linux via Proton on the Steam Deck. Just as there, Nintendo had to test thousands upon thousands of games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">to find any compatibility errors</a>, then trying to fix those, either with patches or under-the-hood improvements for the Switch 2’s translation layer.</p>
<p>However it’s come to pass, the improvements can straighten out some really wonky games. The focus of our comparisons is on the docked modes of these games – something that’s more viable to capture and compare, so let’s start with a real problem child on the Switch 1.</p>

<p>We’ve loaded up the demo for <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a></strong>, a game that had some pretty obvious problems on Switch 1, barely holding onto 30fps and often going down to the low 20s – and that’s before considering split-screen. On Switch 2? Well, it’s a practical 30fps lock, which just makes the game feel so much better and consistent, allowing the Breath of the Wild art style to really shine.</p>
<p>We’ll jump on over, now, to the <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review-switch-musou/">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a></strong> demo, which came a couple years later and shows improved optimisation and balance on the Switch 1. In fact, this game came with an unlocked frame rate that very rarely dipped below 30fps. Though… since it’s in the mid-30s most of the time, it really should have had a 30fps cap at the time.</p>
<p>But in 2025, we’re glad they chose not to, because this makes it a fantastic showcase for the Switch 2’s inherent power bump. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is a near perfect 60fps on Switch 2!</p>

<p>A similar example is <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/11/dragon-quest-builders-2-review/">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a></strong>. This game could be really, really punishing on original Switch, especially with more complex custom creations shared online from more powerful platforms. Performance was generally acceptable through the campaign though, the open world gameplay being north of 30fps, but maybe in the low 20s for busy towns, flying around and when lots of NPCs are on screen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this also comes with an unlocked frame rate, and performance is not far off a straight doubling for Switch 2. In sparse scenes you can get 60fps, though those busier areas and if you’re flying rapidly across the world do pull the Switch 2 down to the mid-low 50s.</p>

<p>Those have all been 30fps target games, but what about an unsteady 60?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/14/bayonetta-bayonetta-2-have-found-a-new-home-on-nintendo-switch/">Bayonetta 2</a></strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/14/bayonetta-bayonetta-2-have-found-a-new-home-on-nintendo-switch/"> was already pretty solid on Switch 1</a>, as a port across from the Wii U. There can be minor dips within the arena combat, and let’s just say that with rare exceptions, Switch 2 evens those minor kinks out quite nicely. It wasn’t quite as smooth in handheld though, and some areas could exhibit noticeable frame rate drops, which have seemingly been ironed out by Switch 2’s increased handheld power as well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/bayonetta-3-review/">Bayonetta 3</a></strong> was much more ambitious with the Switch 1 as its base platform and, surprise, surprise, it’s nowhere near to PlatinumGames’ usual 60fps target a lot of the time. We’re taking regularly dropping to the low 50s, high 40s, and the most sensational action going all the way down to the 30s – cutscenes were once again rendered at 30fps.</p>
<p>But guess what? Switch 2 brings 60fps through and through, outside of those most cinematic moments where PlatinumGames input a 30fps frame cap.</p>
<p>Another problem child from the first party line up was <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></strong>. The worst of the issues in this game emerged when playing handheld where the chip stepped down to lower power modes, the dynamic resolution and upscaling getting <em>seriously</em> blurry, but there are also issues when docked, such as some severe pop-in when loading to a new area and performance that could degrade to below 30fps. Thankfully later games and ports made different technical choices to get better image quality and performance, but Xenoblade 2 has been stuck like this on Switch 1.</p>

<p>Playing on Switch 2 comes with a big improvement thanks to an improved frame rate, a better base resolution that’s noticeable both in handheld and docked, and faster loading of assets.</p>
<p>But the Switch 2 can’t fix or improve everything. If a game was already pretty well attuned to a 30fps cap, then the only improvements can come from better dynamic resolution scaling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/28/wolfenstein-ii-nintendo-switch-review/">Wolfenstein 2</a>,</strong> for example, is a game that’s designed to target 60fps on PS4 and Xbox One, but was limited to 30fps on Switch and, as Panic Button’s second effort with idtech after Doom, it did a pretty good job of sticking to it. This was achieved by much more than just reducing resolution, the texture detail also being significantly reduced, combining to give gives the game a lot of almost putty-like blurriness. Add in hefty motion blur, which is much more of a smear when at 30fps than 60fps, and it makes playing this game feel compromised, regardless of Switch 1 or 2.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 does boost the dynamic resolutions to help quite significantly with blurriness, but the loss of top end detail and being limited to 30fps just doesn’t feel as good as you’d want from this series.</p>

<p>It’s a shade ironic that the most tuned and optimised game for Switch can’t benefit as much from this kind of improvement on Switch 2, while those less optimised titles come good.</p>
<p>In general, this straight backward compatibility offers a fantastic showcase of how the Switch 2 can apply its raw power to last generation games and deliver some tangible improvements. A game with an uneven frame rate can be smoothed out, something with a low dynamic resolution can be improved, and a lot of the most troubled games on Switch 1 will give a better experience on Switch 2.</p>
<p>However, all of the games here would benefit from a Switch 2 patch or a paid Switch 2 Edition release. It would be fantastic to get Age of Calamity running at 60fps, to have Bayonetta 2 and 3 at 1080p in handheld, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and the rest of the series to remastered for higher resolutions. I know a lot of PlatinumGames fans are also pining for an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/astral-chain-review/">Astral Chain</a> patch to lift the 30fps lock, to unchain one of the studio’s Switch highlights.</p>
<p>We have seen these kinds of patches in other games, and the results there can be pretty fantastic as well, but that’s for another article…</p>

<p>In terms of "raw computing power", that is</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Xbox Series S" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9e139a3bed6/switch-2-xbox-series-s.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>They say that comparison is the thief of Joy-Con — or something along those lines — but ever since Switch 2's reveal, people have been clamouring to work out how Nintendo's latest matches up against the other consoles on the market. Before launch, the tech experts over at Digital Foundry suggested the console was roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">in line with Sony's PS4</a>, but Koei Tecmo has recently estimated that it might be even beefier.</p>
<p>That is according to producer Takuto Edagawa, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/">wccftech</a> about the upcoming Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, estimated that Switch 2 might be closer to the Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power" than Sony's last-gen system.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power, so it's difficult to generalise," Edagawa told the outlet, "but I think it can be thought [of] as closer to the Series S".</p>
<p>We suspected that Switch 2 would never be able to stand toe-to-toe with the likes of the PS5 and Series X, but hearing that developers understand it to be roughly in line with the Series S proves that there has been a pretty substantial upgrade under the hood — as if the promise of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> wasn't proof enough.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the wccftech interview, Edagawa revealed that the team has not used NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution for the Switch 2 version of Wild Hearts S, though they <em>did</em> implement HD Rumble 2 to achieve "more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments".</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>25th July</strong>, bringing the Monster Hunter-style adventure to the Nintendo hybrid with more beasts and modes, GameChat implementation, and a new four-player multiplayer option.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/nintendo-switch-2-sets-new-records-with-over-3-5-million-sales-in-4-days/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has confirmed a record-setting launch for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with over 3.5 million units sold worldwide in the first four days on the market.</p>
<p>This is not only the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware in the first four days – the original Switch only reached 2.74 million units through its entire launch month of March 2017 – but also seems to dramatically out-pace Sony and Microsoft’s best efforts.</p>


<p>We don’t have an apples-to-apples comparison, but the PlayStation 4 sold 2.1 million within its first two weeks. Sony didn’t provide specifics, noting that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-25-ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history">the PlayStation 5 surpassed that</a>, but the PS5 then largely kept pace with the previous generation through the first quarter to ship 4.5 million through the end of 2020 (its first 7 weeks on sale).</p>
<p>So, let’s just say that the Switch 2 is the fastest selling console launch.</p>
<p>This record comes with the caveat that the PS5 launched in the middle of a silicon shortage and Sony struggled to maintain supply for the following year. We don’t know what Sony would have managed to sell if they could fully meet demand at the launch of either PS4 or PS5. Of course, you can only beat the competition that’s in before you, and Nintendo has done exactly that by ensuring that there is all of this Switch 2 supply ready to go for launch.</p>

<p>It also comes despite all of the criticisms over pricing for the Switch 2 and its tentpole launch title, Mario Kart World. The Switch 2 is more expensive than the original console, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> set a new $80 price point that many fear will become another new standard price point for major game releases. Nintendo has softened the blow somewhat by offering a cheaper game bundle with Mario Kart World included, and that has almost certainly been the preferred SKU.</p>
<p>It’s also fair to say that major tech products will sell out no matter what. We’ll have to see if the Nintendo Switch 2 can keep up the pace and continue to sell better than the original Switch and PlayStation’s best through the coming months and years.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> is the company's fastest-selling hardware ever, having sold 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale.</p>
<p>This data has been provided by Nintendo itself, following the console's launch last Thursday.</p>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 represents the next evolution of Nintendo Switch, and we're very happy and grateful to see it already being embraced by so many players across Europe," said Luciano Pereña, CEO and president of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a>. "We look forward to seeing players connecting through games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, sharing the experience with friends and family whether near or far."</p>

<p>For comparison, Sony sold 4.5m PS5 units globally in its first quarter back in 2020, so Switch 2 has just a million less but in four days. Microsoft has not shared launch numbers of its Xbox Series X/S console.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-reportedly-nintendos-biggest-uk-launch-but-sits-behind-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs"> reported the console was Nintendo's biggest launch in the UK</a> with the Switch 2 outselling the original Switch by over two to one. However, it's behind the equivalent launches of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Nintendo has forecast it will sell 15m units from release until the end of the financial year, meaning it's just under a quarter of the way there in four days.</p>
<p>News of these initial sales comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">price of its games and accessories</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo warned demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages.</p>

The company stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">considering a post-launch price rise if the situation worsens</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, then, Nintendo is still celebrating a huge launch of its latest console. Have you got yourself a Switch 2? What do you think so far?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, the game quickly surpassed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within an hour of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players.</p>

So what can we infer from seeing Dune Awakening pull this off? Well, a growth of roughly 40 percent in peak players (on a Tuesday no less) indicates a sizable number of players were waiting in the wings for the cheaper version of the game. It's still possible that the game could hit another peak too this weekend, following the trend established by the early launch.

</p><p>It'll be interesting to see to what degree the end game Landsraad and deep desert map can retain players, especially those who may have grabbed it for a romp with friends or a more single player, solitary experience. When you get to the end game, Dune Awakening does a baton pass from a survival game core to more of an MMO server-wide PvP and politics experience. How many of these initial players stick around for this bit, remains a big question.</p>
<p>To celebrate the full launch yesterday, it looks as though the Funcom team were enjoying mini cupcakes at the office, <a href="https://x.com/Tascharoe/status/1932439203641717162">as shown off on social media by one Tascha Röösli on Twitter</a>. Launching a video game, especially a big online one like Dune Awakening, is a big task. Why not celebrate a little?</p>
<p>Dune Awakening had previously proved so popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">as to dethrone Elden RIng Nightreign from its perch atop of the Steam top sellers page</a> just before its initial release on the 5th June.</p>
<p>If you're looking to jump into the game, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Eurogamer's Dune Awakening preview</a> - it's "the perfect blend of survival, MMORPG, and house envy". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One minute you’re flicking through Steam’s Next Fest demos, and finding one that looks to be included despite having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3068230/view/498320947205375622?l=english">come out in May</a>. The next, you’re desperately firing missiles into the rear end of giant monster truck, a sole red light glaring out from its metallic behind, as though it’s mega-pissed that it seems to have gotten stuck in a cluster of trees. Given that, it should be easy prey for the ordnance strapped to the bonnet of my very <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a>-ish muscle car coated in enough sheets of metal to fence off several allotments.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3068230/Mad_Metal/">Mad Metal</a>, though, an indie game whose murderous enemy cars have minds of their own and move more like automotive animals than simple machines.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The car combat was the thing that drew me to try the demo of solo developer Hakim Elayday’s work-in-progress metal twister, which fittingly looks to have grown from<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1gxca8h/made_a_vehicle_combat_game_because_i_was_sad/"> its creator’s sadness</a> at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">last year’s reports</a> Sony had canceled an unannounced live-service Twisted Metal game.</p>
<p>I’m a simple man, I see the opportunity to slam the pedal to the metal and fire a machine gun while doing some skids, and I take it. As you can imagine, then I was in my element when pretty much right out of the gate, Mad Metal tasked me with chasing down and stopping a train covered in rusty spikes.</p>
<p>Yelling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3GK_sfPVM">the line</a> from GTA San Andreas as I went, I splattered the engine pulling it with lead until it looked like a chrome colander, and was rewarded with some new car parts. This is the general loop of Mad Metal from what I’ve played of it so far. You drive around an Unreal Engine map that’s mostly hills littered with light shrubbery and patches of woodland, running into groups of two or three hostile vehicles from various gangs at a time.</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri7hRfaHdMc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Then, the great driving dance of death begins. You and your foes that in some instances seem to lurch around more like hostile creatures than cars orbit each other, firing your ordnance and occasionally smashing together, until one of you explodes. It’s an absolute blast most of the time, with the loveable jankiness with which it all happens just adding to the blast you can have with it.</p>
<p>There was one point when I was fighting two “Monster Driller ATVs” - bright yellow armoured 4x4s with three spinning drill bits menacingly protruding from their bumpers - and ended up wearing one as a hat. Its raised suspension meant that my slam into it had wedged me underneath, so I merrily drove around for a bit with my camera clipped into the invisible void of a nonexistent interior, watching as its circular teeth continued to spin away despite their host being out for the count.</p>
<p>There’s a slow time button, which really helps you appreciate fun little touches like the game’s bushes hastily flattening like frightened possums in response to you launching a flurry of bullets at a camper van. There’s also a giant metal eye right out of something like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Portal hovering over you the whole time, providing guidance and dropping memey computer sass like “he needs some milk” when you get exploded.</p>
<p>Overall, at this point Mad Metal’s a bit of a car crash, in both good ways and bad. The core of it’s pretty fun, even if getting a kick out of the more ridiculous jank has definitely played a role in that for me. It’s not got a release date right now, but the demo’s definitely something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During this phase, the team's top priority is gathering player feedback and continuing the development of the game with more enhanced features, improved performance, and an overall immersive and engaging experience. We're thankful for our dedicated inZOI community and look forward to sharing new content updates over the coming months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Krafton announced inZOI is coming to the Mac App Store and Steam in August. The Mac version of inZOI is optimized for the latest macOS on Apple Silicon, Krafton said, and takes “full advantage” of Apple’s MetalFX and Core ML “to deliver the same great gameplay experience as on Windows.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> released last night, and within a matter of hours gameplay footage was going viral online. However, this was not because players were sharing their positive experiences. Rather, it was because they were sharing a multitude of glitches and error screens which were appearing as they attempted to make their way through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Mctannen/status/1932574418397536412">Glitches</a> have ranged from <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1932500739999330419">stuttering issues</a> to <a href="https://x.com/SlashLP89/status/1932517088280957096">stretching bodies</a> and distorted character faces (see header image above). Many posts across social media question why the game wasn't delayed, given it has been <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1932547822345126241">released in such a broken state</a>. Others <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1932498253452616032">suggest the game is overpriced for what it delivers</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MindsEye <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">reviews on Steam</a> currently sit with a "mixed" average, with many again calling out performance issues and assumed lack of prior testing, although there is also praise for its story so far. The MindsEye Discord has similar comments, with discussions about the game's "unfinished state" and inconsistent frame rates.</p>
<p>As for its player numbers, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3265250/charts/">SteamDB</a> shows MindsEye had a launch concurrent player peak of 3,302. At the time of writing, there are only 993 players in the game via Steam. </p> <div>

<p>Developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/">Build A Rocket Boy released a statement</a> on the MindsEye reddit following the game's launch, stating it was "working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles". The developer said it understood that the current minimum PC spec requirements "are very high". It will be detailing its next patch at some time today.</p>
<p>Plenty still hope that MindsEye can turn its fortunes around with the help of a patch or two. There is some good faith out there that it can redeem itself, and several players have said there does appear to be a decent enough foundation tucked beneath the game's issues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days on the market. The news <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes</a> from Nintendo itself, which also confirmed that the Switch 2 is now its fastest-selling console ever when considering this timeframe.</p>
<p>This early result certainly won't surprise industry analysts, who have been forecasting that the Nintendo Switch 2 will become the fastest-selling console ever in gaming history. DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that 15 million units could be sold by the end of this year, and that was with the looming shadow of Trump's tariffs. Without that, DFC Intelligence reckoned it could reach 17 million units.</p>
<p>Of course, any console's track record is a marathon rather than a sprint, but the new hardware certainly started off strong. Reception has also been very positive so far. On Wccftech, Chris Wray praised the new system in many ways in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, I thoroughly recommend the Switch 2. Like the Switch, it's a great console with a mixture of handheld and regular. This feels sturdier, and the quality of life improvements are far stronger than you may think when simply reading about them. Still, even though I overwhelmingly recommend the Switch 2, if you already have a Switch, I would probably hold out for an offer, which you likely will need to, and for a few games to pad out the abysmal launch line-up. Then again, I got this the same day as people buying it did, so I know you're going to have to wait because it sold better than stolen gold at the Swiss Bankers Convention.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>

<p>On another note, according to Koei Tecmo, the new console is closer to the Xbox Series S than Sony's PlayStation 4.

<p>Game-Key Card releases have been a huge talking point in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 – arguably blurring the lines between physical and digital media.</p>
<p>Now that Nintendo's new system is out, it seems Capcom has revealed how it will be reporting game-key card sales. This information comes from a financial briefing Q&amp;A summary, and it's been confirmed the Japanese company will treat game-key cards as "digital sales".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. Are key cards for Nintendo Switch 2 (game cards that feature an activaition key necessary to launch the software) recorded as physical or digital units?</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kqntsw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>A. They are recorded as digital sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's that – game-key cards are classed as digital media by Capcom. It follows a story last week about how publishers are actually thanking Nintendo for this new option, as many companies face "rising costs to make games".</p>
<p>Capcom last week released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 as a game-key card release, and while it comes with all of the Year 1 and Year 2 DLC, this part of the game is actually a download code. So the main game is on the game-key card, but you'll still need to input a code on the eShop to access the DLC.</p>
<p>If you were to end up giving away this card in the future, it seems the next user would then have to repurchase the game's DLC.</p>

<figure><a title="Charles Martinet" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f509946734b9/charles-martinet.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's been some recent confusion on social media and elsewhere online about what the former voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, is allowed to do when it comes to promoting the iconic Nintendo mascot at certain public events.</p>
<p>It stems from a post shared by the online content creator Ricky Berwick, who mentioned how Martinet "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices either" at a convention he recently attended. Berwick added to this, claiming Martinet wasn't allowed to do any of this on video, but "off camera was fine".</p>
<p>This led to <a href="https://x.com/CharlesMartinet/status/1932458680542474319">Charles Martinet responding to Ricky's original post</a> – explaining how it's all about maintaining the integrity of the character and it's his call:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charles Martinet:</strong> "Oh Ricky. I do the Voice for every Fan I meet. I just don’t improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue. That’s my choice to be sure. I always maintain the integrity of the character. But come and visit me at any Comic Con or Fan expo and you’ll hear super Mario for sure! #woohoo"<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ricky Berwick:</strong> "As long as it's your choice at the end of the day."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a separate video, <a href="https://x.com/rickyberwick/status/1932157603460911283">Ricky actually shared a video of himself</a> and Martinet – with Charles humming the Mario theme song on camera, but not actually voicing the character.</p>
<p>So, hopefully, it's a bit clearer now – if you do go to a convention to meet Charles, you can still hear him say famous Super Mario lines, but you might not be able to record it on camera, and don't expect him to just necessarily say <em>anything</em>, as it's apparently all about maintaining the integrity of the legendary character he voiced for many years.</p>
<p>Charles Martinet was originally given the title of "Mario Ambassador" in 2023 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/charles-martinet-reveals-his-favourite-super-mario-games-at-nintendo-live-2024">last year made an appearance at Nintendo Live 2024</a>. He's been officially replaced by Kevin Afghani in the video games, who most recently voiced Mario in the Switch 2 title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>In some other Mario voice actor news, the voice of Peach last week revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/princess-peachs-voice-actor-has-been-replaced-after-18-years">she was no longer voicing the princess</a> after an 18-year run.</p>

<p>"The fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5761921612aa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the Switch 2's launch last week, Nintendo has now officially confirmed its new hybrid hardware has sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days.</p>
<p>The system debuted on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> and this figure happens to make it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em> in the first four days.</p>
<p>This follows the recent news about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">annihilating the competition in the UK</a> with the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the same day. Other reports suggest the new system has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-switch-2-is-already-breaking-sales-records-in-france">sold incredibly well in locations like France</a> and Spain.</p>
<p>So that's again "over" 3.5 million units and counting. According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">official Nintendo data</a>, the original Switch is currently sitting at 152 million units after an eight-year run. Other platforms like the Wii U and GameCube shifted 13 million and 21 million units respectively during their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World appears to be the go-to launch title for the Switch 2 (and has even been bundled as part of a slightly more expensive Switch 2 package), so it will be interesting to see how many sales it's made from the new hardware release.</p>
<p>Based on Nintendo's information here, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad notes how this technically makes the Switch 2 the "<a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1932629946834563455">fastest selling home video game console of all time</a>".</p>

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z15RK?object_uuid=abc75198-2cb1-4e93-be63-56b515f0fb81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">128GB model is $269.99</a> after a $30 off discount. and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Xd1?object_uuid=abc75198-2cb1-4e93-be63-56b515f0fb81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">256GB is $349.99</a> after a $50 off instant discount. These discounts are honored at major retailers including Amazon, Target, and Walmart. The Meta Quest 3S is widely considered the best value in VR gaming. Not only is it priced hundreds less compared to most other competitors (including Meta's own Quest3), it's also a standalone untethered gaming system that doesn't require a PC or PlayStation 5 to run,,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To sweeten the pot even more, every Quest 3S purchase includes a copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a> game and a three-month trial of Meta Quest+. In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">8/10 review</a>, Dan Stapleton wrote that "Batman: Arkham Shadow makes most of the Arkham series' defining gameplay work respectably well in VR, and its mystery story pays off."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Meta Quest 3S VR Headset with Batman: Arkham Shadow</h2><div id="222595" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="46006467-4f90-4d47-ad0b-ab15ae567c6a"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meta Quest 3S 256GB VR Headset</h3></p></div><div catalogid="46006467-4f90-4d47-ad0b-ab15ae567c6a" id="207786"><div id="207786" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meta Quest 3S 128GB VR Headset</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Quest 3S is an improvement over the original Quest 2 in every way and, amazingly, without a price increase. It also adopts many of the same features of the more expensive Quest 3, like the new and improved Touch controllers, the upgraded SnapDragon APU, and support for full color AR passthrough. In IGN's 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S review</a>, Gabriel Moss wrote that "raw processing power, full-color passthrough, and snappy Touch Plus controllers make the Quest 3S a fantastic standalone VR headset that also brings entry-level mixed-reality gaming to the masses for – arguably – the very first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What really sets this deal above all other VR deals is that the Meta Quest 3S can be played <strong>completely untethered</strong>. That means you can play games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/28/beat-saber-review">Beat Saber</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/08/pistol-whip-review">Pistol Whip</a> without having to own a powerful gaming PC or a PlayStation 5 console. Try to find another standalone VR headset at this price and you'll come up empty.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Is the Quest 3S Different from the Quest 3?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at retail price, the Quest 3S comes in at $200, or 40% cheaper than the $500 <a href="https://howl.link/33aavd3s563fo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quest 3</a>. Obviously, some compromises were made to get the 3S to its competitive price point. The spec comparisons are listed below:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 <u>Similarities</u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor</li><li>Touch Plus controllers</li><li>120Hz refresh rate</li><li>Mixed reality passthrough (same cameras, different layout)</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 <u>Differences</u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lower per-eye resolution (1832x1920 vs 2064×2208)</li><li>Fresnel lens vs. pancake lens</li><li>Lower FOV (96°/90° vs 104°/96°)</li><li>Smaller storage capacity (128GB vs 512GB)</li><li><strong>Longer</strong> battery life (2.5hrs vs 2.2hrs)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For the price, the Quest 3S is a better value than the Quest 3, and the best choice for gamers who are just starting out in the world of VR and want to test the waters. It is hands down a major improvement over the Quest 2 that it replaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>Sonic experts are on the case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week, SEGA unveiled the first batch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> guest characters. This includes not only characters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hatsune_miku_project_diva_mega_mix">Hatsune Miku</a> but also Steve, Alex and Creeper from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. There are some other supposed leaks still doing the rounds as well.</p>
<p>Now, the official Sonic social media account has sent Sonic fans into a frenzy once again, with a new piece of artwork apparently featuring a very familiar-looking symbol. The focus here is on what looks exactly like the Triforce from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before anyone gets excited here, no – it's <em>probably</em> not what you might be thinking. Some <a href="https://x.com/Fantactx/status/1932073396486947161">Sonic fans</a> <a href="https://x.com/NoahAFS/status/1931403746895880421">are convinced</a> the character Espio (who is a ninja) and the symbol are linked, and this is more likely to be a reference to Japan's Hōjō clan. Others acknowledge how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1l7n72x/so_why_is_the_triforce_in_an_official_sonic/">similar patterns have featured</a> in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fantactx: "It's not a teaser for Link to be in the game, it's a symbol used by the Hōjō clan back in 13th century Japan who were allies with a ninja clan which is why it's near Espio as he himself, is a ninja. A example of this being used for inspiration would be the Triforce."</p>
<p>NoahAFS: "No everyone, that's not the Triforce next to Espio, that's the symbol of the Hōjō clan, a Japanese samurai family. This does not mean Link is coming to CrossWorlds."</p>
<p>Shaddy_the_guy: "This is just a pattern that can exist, y'know. It's all over the walls in Palmtree Panic"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case closed then, or is it? Stranger crossovers have happened and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> series has even hosted some platform-exclusive characters in the past. Link's also starred in a racing game already, so why not another? And while this kind of crossover would have been unimaginable once upon a time, Sega and Nintendo maintain a great relationship nowadays.</p>
<p>So, while we're not completely ruling anything out here (<em>at least for now</em>), we wouldn't suggest you get your hopes up. In some other Sonic Racing news, Sega has confirmed there'll be a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, along with a paid upgrade.</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you like to see any guests from certain Nintendo franchises feature in Sonic? How about Link or Sonic in something like Mario Kart World? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

For one, it's held over a weekend, which is also the best time to go outside, see friends and hang out. Also there are also too many games spread over too many shows for even the most resolute of you to hope to sit there live and truly catch it all. </p><p>I found that this year, like any other year, the best thing to do was to skip it entirely and just catch up on trailers over the next few days at my own pace. In the spirit of this delayed (yet also emotionally restorative) approach, here are some of the coolest games I saw after SGF, not because <em>I saw them</em>, but because people I love and trust and who did blow their weekend watching commercials (thank you for your service) said "watch this trailer it's sick".</p><p><strong>WHEEL WORLD</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wheel World - Official Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DDmlRdgcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>We’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written</a> about this game before,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-bike-trailer-pc-steam-xbox-ps-bicycle-game-italy-1850593884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> including a couple years back when it had a different name</a>.

So I'm even gladder that this one is almost done, because while we could all do with a decent <em>Sims </em>competitor, it's <em>Paralives</em>' furniture and architecture tools that have got me most excited.</p><hr><p><strong>STRANGER THAN HEAVEN</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Oh look, it's me writing up a RGG game announcement as the highlight of an event,<a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-shopfronts-are-one-of-lifes-little-pleasures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> how off-brand</a>.

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Harvest Moon</a> is returning to the Switch next month with two 3DS games, but it looks like there could be even more on the way.</p>
<p>According to a new rating that's popped up in Taiwan, the mobile game <strong>Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home 'Deluxe Edition'</strong> is making its way across to the Switch and PlayStation 5. As mentioned by Gematsu, this game originally made its debut on iOS and Android devices in August 2024.</p>
<p>It's developed by Appci, published by Natsume, and is described as being the "biggest Harvest Moon game ever" on mobile devices. In this entry, you'll "woo a variety of bachelors and bachelorettes, marry whomever your heart desires", harvest crops, care for animals, fish, mine, and much more.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You can also get involved in various contests and festivals while collecting and gathering to grow the village and get more residents. Here's an official description from the App Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Head back to your roots and leave the city life for your childhood village of Alba in Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home, where the freshest fish and tastiest veggies are grown and caught by the local farmers and anglers!</p>
<p>"However, with its population getting older and younger villagers leaving for the big city, Alba Village has seen better days, so can you help turn it from a village on the decline to one of prosperity? With its beautiful surroundings, Alba definitely has the potential, so work hard to bring tourists and even new residents to this sprawling green village! Reunite with your childhood friend and other familiar faces to help put Alba on the map!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Note: this review contains some small spoilers for Deltarune's first two chapters.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was nearly seven years ago on Halloween when I woke up at the crack of dawn to download an ominous “Survey Program” from Undertale developer Toby Fox. It turned out that this program contained not just a simple survey, but the start of a grand adventure that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about since. Now, with the release of the third and fourth chapters, that adventure has truly started to take a more solid shape. Deltarune carries on the spirit of its predecessor by subverting expectations of the RPG genre in the wildest ways. It also shares the same sort of clever, heartfelt, and often absurdly hilarious writing, not to mention a truly unforgettable soundtrack. Don’t be fooled by its deceptively humble pixel art and initially simple plot: there’s a surprising amount of intrigue, beauty, and unpredictability just under the surface. The unsettling questions Deltarune raises about our relationship to the characters we control in games provides an engrossing layer of meta-commentary, while still celebrating the indomitable willpower and heart of extraordinary RPG heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That aforementioned creepy survey demo ended up only being the first chapter of Deltarune, with the second released in 2021, and finally the most recent two arriving just last week as part of its more traditional “full” release – although, that’s not to say it’s “finished” now, as more chapters are planned to arrive as free content updates in the future. But no matter if you are picking up where you left off years ago or starting fresh from the first chapter, you’ll be unceremoniously thrust into the body of a weird teen named Kris. There are a lot of similarities to Undertale here, but also more than enough differences in its setting and how battles work to set it apart. Where Undertale had you navigating an underground society of imprisoned monsters you either had to fight or befriend, Deltarune begins in a pleasant but unremarkable “Hometown” – though for some reason you’re still the only human around in a world of monsters. The only epic struggles to be found here are trying to stay awake through class, or dodging the extreme embarrassment of seeing your divorced adoptive monster parents run into each other at the store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played Undertale, you might get a kick out of seeing several of that game’s more notable figures living regular lives in this parallel story, but I wouldn’t quite say it’s required. In fact, I’d argue that Deltarune is at its best when it’s not trying to focus on what came before it – funny as those interactions may be. I’ll admit, at first I was a little disappointed to see familiar faces appearing in what was supposed to be a new adventure, but then I realized these aren’t simple fanservice cameos. In another universe, these were imposing boss monsters – kings and queens with terrifying strength and magical powers. Here, they’re just… ordinary townsfolk: teachers, bored police, and struggling shop owners. While they may have a role to play, this story isn’t truly about them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a great touch how even the menus and UI change to reflect this new realm.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, things kick off when Kris and a rude, crude monster classmate named Susie find themselves transported into a world of fantasy straight out of an ‘80s adventure movie. Here, pencils and bandaids transform into swords and armor, while forgotten classroom toys or computer lab accessories spring to life as “Darkeners”, many of which will stand in your way. It’s a great touch how even the menus and UI change to reflect this new realm. The environments you’ll find yourself exploring in these “Dark Worlds” are anything but: they’re filled with vibrant and beautiful pixel art backdrops that work in harmony with a stunning soundtrack to capture the themes of these fascinating places.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Happy Feet, Dumbass</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not long after arrival in the Dark World that you meet your third “party member:” a lonely Darkener prince named Ralsei who seems to know all about you, and gives you the grand spiel about cleansing dark fountains and saving the world from destruction. You know, hero stuff. To get to your goal, you’ll have to fight your way through enemies, frenemies, misunderstood goofballs – pretty much everything you can think of. As with Undertale, you’ll learn that the path to victory can be forged with turn-based violence or pacifism, but the long-term consequences aren’t as clear cut here. Striking enemies into submission allows you to get stronger quicker, though finding ways to spare opponents will lead to your own Dark World’s Castle Town becoming populated with now-friendly occupants, and may even change how certain scenes play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Truly, the best part of battles is the ability to “Act” on your turn – winning over an opponent with enough mercy to spare them, in between dodging an ever-expanding variety of deadly bullet patterns on the enemy’s turn within the confines of a box that pops onto the screen. On paper, this system could easily lose its charm, but here it’s kept entertaining by exceptionally witty and context-sensitive execution. Each foe has different needs that get more complex (and often wacky) the further you delve into these adventures. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Things may start with you ordering a party member to flirt their way toward mercy, but it wasn’t too much later I found myself up against tougher ambulance-themed adversaries. Asking Susie to “Act” instead gave me a challenge: dodge the ambulance-themed bullets on the enemy’s turn to earn more mercy for a risky play (because she doesn’t trust doctors, naturally). Whereas Ralsei’s “Act” would suggest getting hit on purpose instead (because they’re here to… help?), which wasn’t a bad call if I was having trouble dodging already. It’s moments like these where Deltarune’s creative juices are at their tastiest, combining fun contextual commands that blend limitless humor while leaning into the personalities of both your team and the Darkeners you’ll face. Each new encounter left me eager to see what my Fun Squad could come up with, and with a mix of plentiful enemy variety and Dark World areas that never stretched on too long, I never really found myself getting tired of the opponents I came up against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even beyond fighting and ACTing, I really came to appreciate how Deltarune’s three party members allowed me to develop synergies and tactics as time went on. Later battles became delicate dances of assigning heals or items, then having one person ACT so that another could spare on the same turn (provided my ACTs were successful). Even the process of dodging incoming attacks provides a new layer of strategy with the ability to “graze” the bullet patterns by moving my little heart icon alongside the attacks or dodging at the last second without getting hit to build a meter necessary to perform certain magical powers. Just like ACTing, certain magic could change depending on the battle to accommodate new strategies and challenges unique to that fight, and often made the risky play to get close to attacks worthwhile.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Power of Page Breaks Shines Within You</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when I wasn’t fighting, there was a lot to explore both in and out of the Dark Worlds I visited. Being able to wander around, talk to people, and interact with objects isn’t exactly a new RPG idea. (I have vivid memories of obsessively checking every trash can in a Pokemon game, often leaving disappointed.) But what I believe sets Deltarune apart is the confidence it has in making its world worth stopping in to smell the roses. You might find a container of Ice-E’s Cool Boys Body Spray “Spray For the Boys” Flamin’ Hot Pizza Flavor under the bathroom sink, for instance. Deltarune’s hilariously illogical humor oozes into every corner of the world like some sort of weird goop that’s actually kind of delicious and also addictive for some reason. It’s so intrinsically linked with everything else – combat, dialogue, story, puzzles, you name it – that I couldn’t imagine this adventure being any other way. Seriously, in what other setting would you encounter a weird little dolphin attacking you with internet pop-up screens in reference to some obscure 14-year-old meme about a desktop image trying to lure you into downloading viruses?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just the jokes, either (rampant as they may be); I found myself constantly intrigued by the world being set up around this adventure. Not all of it is laid out in big, showy cutscenes and plot developments. There’s a level of reward that is given to those willing to inspect things they may otherwise walk right past, or talk to someone you may not expect to have a nugget of wisdom to give. It’s a type of detail that doesn’t seem all that impressive at first glance, and yet I’ve come to appreciate immensely during my time in each of the four currently available chapters. Even something as random as inspecting an innocuous patch of moss can steadily grow into its own running gag between chapters, which  feels like I’ve uncovered a special secret. In this way, Deltarune is also rife with small, personal moments and anecdotes that allow its characters to shine in a way I rarely see anywhere else.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each place you visit is accompanied by an embarrassment of phenomenal music.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every location has these touches, and the areas I explored on my quest to seal the dark fountains led me through some pretty fantastical interpretations of otherwise ordinary places. The plush carpet of a forgotten classroom became a vast red forest with fields of rippling purple grass, while a computer lab transformed into a larger-than-life shining city of lights and superhighways built from advertisements, and all of it works wonderfully in the distinct pixel-art style. Deltarune is careful about keeping its scope in check, and instead saves moments of visual flair for just the right occasion when you least expect it. Even the amount of expression seen in its character portraits continued to delight me at just how well they were able to convey the right emotions, which only got better and more expressive each chapter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each place you visit is accompanied by an embarrassment of phenomenal music, and as with Undertale, the payoff of Fox personally composing the music in addition to developing so many aspects of Deltarune is clear to see. From its incredibly funky and catchy battle theme to the ethereal exploration of the first Dark World and the upbeat tunes beyond, every new area you’ll visit is a treat for the ears. There’s a wonderful mix of chiptunes in all sorts of genres, and each boss encounter theme somehow surpasses the last with no signs of slowing down. (Did my ears deceive me, or did I hear the TMNT: Turtles in Time soundfont being used?). It’s not just that the music is great, but its decisive inclusions elevate the material with careful use of leitmotifs to tie events and characters together. In one of the later chapters, there are certain rare sequences that bring out the raw emotion of a live piano playing, and left me floored at how well it empowered the scene to reach greater emotional heights.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>It’s Pronounced, “The $!$? Squad”</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick which characters to talk about in a cast that’s so colorful. Whether it’s in the relatively normal Light World, or the dream-like Dark World, the assorted monsters I met made a lasting impression on me. So many of Deltarune’s cast members are actually very, very dumb (in an extremely endearing way, I promise!), and incredibly distinct in ways too numerous to count. Many times, it almost felt like a Royal Rumble of competing scene-stealers, with new challengers arriving all the time. I’d always get a sinking feeling that there would be no way a new chapter could top the previous one’s antics… and yet, each time I was proven wrong in ways I literally could not have expected from both new and returning faces. I still don’t even know if I like Rouxls Kaard (that’s pronounced “Rules Card”) as a person, but I’ll be damned if he didn’t leave me in tears every time he popped up – usually against everyone else’s wishes.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Brendan's Favorite Games Featuring Goofy Little Dogs</h3><p>Seemed like a good idea at the time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But I can’t not talk about the true “Lightener” stars of the show: Kris and Susie, one of my favorite teams I’ve had the pleasure of commanding in turn-based battles. They both go through some very different personal journeys over the course of each chapter, and though we still don't fully know where they lead, they continue to fascinate me. Kris, Susie, and yes - even Ralsei are each loners and outcasts in their own ways, and seeing them form a bond powerful enough to shake the pillars of Heaven has been immensely satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a point early on where I worried that Susie’s own character growth would sputter out too soon after calming down on the more extreme ends of her bullying tough girl act (which is expertly woven into Deltarune’s mechanics to manifest in clever ways both in and out of combat). Instead, I found a wild card. She’s as much the main protagonist of this story as Kris is… sometimes perhaps even more. Susie continually forges her own path when it suits her, leading to surprising revelations and tweaks on how Deltarune plays. She won’t even let you remove gear from her without giving her something else to equip – she’s that feisty! And yet, for all her bark, she makes a wonderfully vocal stand-in for us, going from annoyed disinterest to full-throated enthusiasm as she embraces her role in the story, and her newfound friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They are truly a dumbass duo with joint custody of a single braincell.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Her relationship with her classmate Kris is also something I never get tired of. It encapsulates some of the funniest, most heartwarming, and most sincere parts of Deltarune’s story so far. I can’t count the number of times I inspected an object and was presented with the option to do something profoundly stupid, only to have Susie right there beside me, excitedly goading me on. They are truly a dumbass duo with joint custody of a single braincell, and the enthusiasm they share for the absurd is inescapably contagious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kris on their own is also a fascinating enigma, and explaining why will require a light amount of spoilers from the first two chapters. I hope you’ll forgive me on this, but it’s also one of the central parts of Deltarune’s themes, and how you play it. <strong>You can click on the spoiler tag below to read more.</strong></p><div><p>In Deltarune, you do not play as Kris: you control Kris. You, the player, are a diegetic force in this world, meaning your presence is a tangible entity. You’re a red, heart-shaped object referred to as a SOUL, often seen when selecting choices or dodging attacks. However, it’s soon revealed that you are something of an unwanted guest in Kris’ body, and they may have their own motives and goals that don’t always align with your own. At times, this can even culminate in you being forcibly removed from piloting your fleshy teenage mech, and left helpless as Kris goes off on their own. </p><p>As both a game mechanic and a story idea, it’s an incredibly wild and unique take on the RPG genre in how this possession manifests itself, and further solidifies how Deltarune isn’t just inspired by games that came before it, but also eager to break new ground. As the story unfolds, how can you know if what you are doing is what Kris wants to do? Or… do you even care? It also puts an entirely new layer of meaning onto how the character we control reacts to things, and what information we can glean from that – and the themes of freedom and control will continually vie for your attention as you uncover Deltarune’s secrets. There’s a subtle yet masterful way that Deltarune drops the tiniest of hints that while we may control much of Kris, they can still find ways to inject their personality into the world despite us. Kris may be a silent protagonist from our perspective, but it’s how others react to the tone of their words or expressions that provides a fascinating look into the life of the human we’ve hijacked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t want to say more about how your role continues to escalate in later chapters, nor do I wish to spoil much of the contents of Chapter 3 and 4. What I will say is that Chapter 3 felt like a demented roller coaster ride that somehow seamlessly inserted an entirely new way to play that was an absolute blast. Chapter 4 continued to step on the gas pedal, but not in the ways I was expecting – it was more like riding the aforementioned roller coaster into the gaping maw of a dread-inducing abyss. It does have a few slower parts, especially navigating some of the more maze-like areas that seemed to lack the usual unlockable shortcuts until the very end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, nothing prepared me for the harrowing end to Chapter 4. The story remains unfinished, yes, but in no way did I feel let down by it ending where it does for now, having surmounted some incredible odds and witnessed some jaw-dropping moments to get as far as I have.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Splitgate 2 game director Ian Proulx has apologised for causing "division in the community" following his controversial Summer Game Fest appearance, in which he wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat while onstage.
</p>
<p>
Proulx's Summer Game Fest segment last Friday almost immediately drew criticism from viewers; some felt using the high-profile platform to attack another developer's game - he announced he was "tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year" - was tasteless, but it was his hat that seemed to cause most controversy.
</p>
<p>
Its "Make FPS Great Again" logo clearly invoked divisive US president Donald Trump's notorious "Make America Great Again" slogan, and now - after initially <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371">refusing to apologise</a> for wearing it - Proulx has acknowledged the choice, while 'not political', was ill-advised.
</p>
<p>
"It is really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise," he explained in a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">video posted on social media</a>. "We saw it at the TGAs; we had this great trailer and there's 50 other great trailers, and it didn't really have an impact. And so at our biggest stage, coming out of beta, we needed something to grab attention and... this is what we came up with."
</p>
<p>
"We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever," he continued. "Obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was stating our truth. Which is we do want to improve this genre, we are disappointed with the state of the genre. And so we took [the slogan] as a meme that we thought would not be nearly as negatively received as the way it was. And so I want to apologise."
</p>
<p>
"And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community. The most important thing to me right now is I want to have an amazing community... I hate seeing division. And that's what I’m seeing now, on both sides. There's division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry... I do stand by the [face value] intent of this, which is... we do want to improve this genre... But I also understand that it's not just about intent, it's about impact, and the platform that we have had has had a negative impact, and for that I'm truly sorry."
</p>
<p>
Proulx's Summer Game Fest appearance isn't the only controversy Splitgate 2 has faced in recent days, however. Fans lambasted the free-to-play shooter over the weekend after developer 1047 Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">released a cosmetic bundle priced $80 USD, supposedly discounted from $145</a>. In response, the studio slashed that to $40 and reduced prices across the store, pledging to "double down on being community first and listening to you guys."

The fourth entry in the long-running action game series is developed in collaboration with Koei Tecmo's Team Ninja and Platinum Games, best known for titles like Bayonetta and Nier: Automata. The game will follow long-time Ninja Gaiden protagonist Ryu Hayabusa and a new character, Yakumo--who is a member of the Hayabusa Clan's rivals, the Raven Clan. The duo will battle against the forces of the Dark Dragon, who has plunged Tokyo into a permanent storm known as the Rain of Rot.

                <p>Sony has laid off about 30% of the staff at Bend Studio, the first-party developer of the PlayStation 4 open-world game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a>. The publisher confirmed the layoffs in a statement to GameSpot.</p><p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, about 40 people were laid off from the studio.</p><p>In its statement, Sony also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Bend Studio had been working on a live-service game</a> earlier in the year, but that game has been canceled and the studio is moving on to a new, unnamed project.</p><p>"Earlier this year, Bend Studio wrapped development on a live-service concept," the statement reads. "After careful consideration, we chose not to move forward with it. As the team shifts focus to its next project, we’ve made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success. As part of this transition, a workforce reduction has taken place at the studio. This decision was not made lightly, and we are extremely grateful for the meaningful contributions of all those impacted. Bend Studio has been a valued part of PlayStation Studios for decades, and we remain confident in its future and creative direction."</p><p>Sony has canceled multiple games since it announced a focus on developing live-service concepts following its acquisition of Destiny 2 developer Bungie in 2022. Originally, the publisher said it intended to launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games by 2025</a>, but in 2023 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">narrowed that figure to just six</a>.

        <p>Will become new executive chair of the board.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Lars Wingefors, the Embracer Group CEO who oversaw thousands of job cuts and a significant number of studio closures following a turbulent few years for the company, has announced he's stepping down from his role. Wingefors is not, however, parting ways with Embracer, and will instead become its executive chair of the board.
</p>
<p>
"While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers,"  Wingefors said in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/">statement announcing his change of role</a>. "This new phase allows me to focus on strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation, ensuring Embracer's continued growth and success. I am more convinced than ever that the best is still ahead of us."
</p>
<p>
With Wingefors' focus shifting elsewhere, Phil Rogers will step into the vacated CEO role from 1st August. Rogers is currently deputy CEO of Embracer and CEO of Crystal Dynamics – Eidos.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors' time as CEO has been turbulent to say the least. He oversaw a rapid period of expansion at Embracer, with the company embarking on a massive acquisition spree, snapping up the likes of Gearbox, Saber Interactive, Crystal Dynamics, and more - including the €2.75bn purchase of board game publisher Asmodee - over a number of years. However, the unsustainability of that expansion became clear after a $2bn deal with the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">collapsed dramatically in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following the deal's collapse, Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">announced</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program" that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">ultimately resulted in thousands of employees losing their jobs</a>, while a substantial number of studios were either divested or outright closed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition shut its doors in August 2023</a>, for instance, while the revived Free Radical Design, which was working on a new TimeSplitters project, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-design-closed-today-staff-say">closed just a few months later</a>. Soon after, Gearbox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">sold to Take-Two Interactive</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">Saber Interactive went its own separate way</a>. Further layoffs, at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Eidos-Montréal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics</a>, have been announced since then.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-boss-admits-long-list-of-things-hed-have-done-differently-as-embattled-company-splits-into-three">later admitted</a> there was a "long list" of things he'd have done differently, but that it was "easy to look back in hindsight".

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> is an odd little game. How do you begin to sell the idea that a (presumably emotional) herding simulator might be quite interesting? Yes, people love their farming sims as a band aid form of escapism, but a lot of those games are in the first instance much more about farming and not farm animals, nor the way you interact with said animals. Herdling is all about that, as the whole goal is to guide a group of strange horned beasties up a mountain.
</p>

<p>
The demo, which just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/">launched this weekend on Steam</a> after a recent trailer at the Future Games Show, certainly left me a lot to think about. In the first instance, I feel that it's a game that could quite easily fit into the PS3 era of indie games quite specifically - think something along the lines of Journey, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, games where you're just kind of heading forward because that's the thing you're doing. What you make of it along the way is therefore up to you. What do I make of the little bit I've played of Herdling?

<p>
Well, for starters, it's a little bit janky. To start with, anyway, guiding the actually quite sweet Calicorns is a bit awkward, at least up until the breadth of the game's controls are properly explained to you. After spending a short stint in a city, Herdling quite literally opens up into massive, sweeping fields, giving you a much freer reign to roam with your newfound herd. Just simply making a turn offers a challenge due to its slowness, but I got the hang of it quite quickly.
</p>
<p>
You have to be thoughtful in doing so, though. There are dangers to be met with that can hurt your Calicorns (and I believe in kill them, if the game's immortality setting means what I think it does), so you can't just wave them around willy nilly. The slow moving nature of the beasts then means you have to keep yourself on your toes to avoid any morbid fates. To add on to the weight of being responsible for their lives, you can name each Calicorn too. You are the one guiding them, so you must get to know them, and look after them.
</p>
<p>
I admit there is the possibility that Herdling could end up falling into the trope of overly emotional indie game. Still, I find the idea of having such a leadership role over animals that don't quite have as much autonomy and safety as its world might allow to be an interesting one, so consider this a demo that has successfully caught my intrigue. There's no exact release date just yet, but it is expected to release this summer.

During its colonization, ancient relics were found, revealing hints of a shrouded past," the official synopsis reads. "But it was more than relics. Something awakened, an unspeakable horror from an ancient past, and the citizens of Gladius found themselves trapped in a terrible war for survival. Gladius Prime was once a planet of peace. Now there is only war."</p><p>The game features four factions taking on one another in a brutal war for dominance over the planet's resources: Astra Militarum, Space Marines, Orks, and Necrons. Much like the tabletop equivalent, each group has its own unique gameplay, technological tree, units, and heroes.</p><p>If you're looking for more Warhammer 40K games, GOG has a $20 bundle of three Warhammer games, usually priced at $100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684957/splitgate-2-hat-apology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a line in showbiz that goes, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.” Ian Proulx, CEO of <em>Splitgate 2</em> developer 1047 Games, has recently learned the hard way that’s not entirely true. </p><p>Last week, during the Summer Game Fest keynote livestream, Proulx came out to promote his game wearing a black hat that read “Make FPS Great Again” — an obvious reference to Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. The <em>Splitgate 2</em> community, journalists, and regular gamers seized on the hat (and not, you know, the game), immediately calling the statement gross and tone deaf. As questions from the <em>Splitgate 2</em> community poured in, Proulx <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371">doubled down on social media</a>, saying that he would not apologize and that the hat wasn’t a political statement and should be taken at face value. </p><p>Today, however, he’s singing a different tune. He posted on X with the simple caption, “No excuses, I’m sorry,” accompanied by a nearly three-minute video explaining the decision to wear the hat and the intention behind it. </p><p>“We needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is, we tried to think of something, and this is what we came up with,” Proulx said.</p><p>He acknowledged that he was aware the hat would be controversial. His apology was not for the hat itself, but the discussion surrounding the hat within the <em>Splitgate 2 </em>community. Proulx claimed he did not want the division he himself sowed. “The reason I’m sorry is because of what this has done to the community,” he said.</p><p>He continued: “We knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was kind of stating our truth.” As Proulx was making his statement, a few miles away in Los Angeles’ fashion district, where the Summer Game Fest Play Days campus resides, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was conducting raids snatching up people just going about their lives, raids that led to clashes between people protecting their neighbors and defenders of a cruel regime. </p><div><p>When I reported on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682033/everybody-hated-that">the Trump-evoking slogan and the backlash to it</a>, some commenters responded that “it’s just a hat.” </p></div><p>But it is not just a hat. Aping a political statement that has been used to enact state violence isn’t “a meme,” it is a continuation of that violence. I think of the people in attendance at the show and those who work at the YouTube Theater who are immigrants or have immigrant family members. I think of the worker at the City Market Social House, the venue where SGF holds its Play Days event, who told me about the protocol they have in case ICE shows up: how people can hide in a room in the basement and hand out cards so they don’t have to speak to ICE and potentially implicate themselves.</p><p>Proulx’s statement, no matter its form, isn’t just in bad taste. It is a stark reminder to those people that their lives and families are at risk. And saying “I’m sorry, it was just a meme” isn’t enough. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
