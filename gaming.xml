            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-sonys-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time to take a look at another week in the world of gaming business, and this week saw PlayStation's new CEO Hermen Hulst sharing some words about the company's future, as well as a studio entering hibernation and more.</p>

<p>Here's our roundup of what's been happening on the business side of the gaming industry this week!</p>

<h2>PlayStation's new CEOs sets out the company's approach</h2>

<p>This week saw new PlayStation CEOs Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino talking all things PlayStation during the Sony Game and Network Services Business Segment presentation (which is, perhaps, not quite as sexy as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-playstation-state-of-play-sgf-2024-announcement">yesterday's State of Play</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-playstation-gaming-business.jpg?itok=5_9JEf83 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-playstation-gaming-business.jpg?itok=sqvW4kiX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to see more PlayStation live-service games appearing on PC day-and-date.</figcaption></figure><p>During that presentation, Hulst and Nishino said that live-service PlayStation games will be released on PC simultaneously (like with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>), but that "tentpole" single-player narrative games will still be on PlayStation first.</p>

<p>That meeting also revealed that the PS5 is Sony's most profitable PlayStation console to date, and other exciting PlayStation tidbits as well. You can check out the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supplementary material from the presentation here</a> for more nerdy stats.</p>

<h2><em>Wildermyth&nbsp;</em>developer Worldwalker Games goes into "hibernation"</h2>

<p>The developer of tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Wildermyth&nbsp;</em>announced this week that with its work on the project complete, it will be going into "hibernation" for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/wildermyth/status/1795872859232813087" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Worldwalker Games isn't being shut down by external forces, and moving on after the completion of work on&nbsp;<em>Wildermyth&nbsp;</em>was "the plan" all along.</p>

<p>Support for the game will continue in the form of crucial updates and bug fixes, but it won't be getting any more content.</p>

<h2>Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games is facing layoffs</h2>

<p>Earlier this month, reports emerged that&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">closed down</a> by its parent company Take-Two Interactive, although said company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied those rumors</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kerbal-space-program-2-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Pn3UIpIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kerbal-space-program-2-gaming-business.jpg?itok=99UeUONp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>studio Intercept Games isn't having a great time of things right now.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, however, several Intercept staff members (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/intercept-games-facing-layoffs-by-end-of-june" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thanks, GamesIndustry.biz</a>) shared that they would be looking for work soon, with senior design manager Quinn Duffy claiming the whole team at Intercept would be made redundant later in June.</p>

<p>If this is true, then technically speaking, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick wasn't lying when he said Intercept hadn't been shut down earlier this month, although if he knew the studio would soon be shuttered, it's not a great look.</p>

<h2>ZeniMax is now included in Microsoft's labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</h2>

<p>In some more positive news, the CWA (Communications Workers of America) union announced this week that employees of Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax are now included in Microsoft's labor neutrality agreement with the union.</p>

<p>The agreement was <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/13/cwa-and-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally announced back in 2022</a>, but it <a href="https://x.com/CODE_CWA/status/1796247670517862861" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now includes ZeniMax workers</a>, which gives said staffers the chance to engage with the collective bargaining process alongside their Microsoft colleagues.</p>

<h2>CD Projekt releases its financials for the quarter</h2>

<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/05/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q1-2024-4.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first-quarter financial information</a> for&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>studio CD Projekt, and sales this quarter were up by 30% when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>This increase was driven in part by a 94% increase in sales for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion, although sales for games in&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>series fell by 41% compared to last year.</p>

<p>We also learned that the next major&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game has over 400 staffers working on it, and that no developers at CD Projekt Red are currently working on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, suggesting that the studio is finally done with the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-a-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d.886296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the tabletop space, it's hard to think of a revolution for gamers at home larger than 3D Printers becoming so accessible. Whether you are printing terrain, miniatures, organizers for pieces, or wanting to take your games to the real world and printing off cosplay pieces, having a device that can create these gives you options. Options are exactly what Felicia Day is looking to add with her newly launched <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/feliciaday3d">FeliciaDay3D model subscription</a>.</p>

<p>Last week we got to sit down with <a href="https://felicia.day/">Felicia Day</a> - a name many should know from web series <em>The Guild</em>, Geek &amp; Sundry, the originator of <em>Critical Role</em>, and various roles across movies and TV - and talk about her entry into the 3D printing space, how she works and consults with 3D artists, and how working on these projects has rekindled her love with projects that she thought she was burnt out on.</p>

<h2>What is FeliciaDay3D?</h2>

<p>In Day's own words, "FeliciaDay3D is a site you can go to at <a href="https://thangs.com/?sort=trending">thangs.com</a>, you can get a subscription to download 3D models or you can buy things individually. What I do is I design models with really cool designers an we offer those exclusively as well as curating different designers from the web.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I really have gotten into 3D Printing and fell in love with it. The tinkering aspect and the engineering of it, but also the artistry."</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Starting In 3D Printing</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/FeliciaDay3D/post/Welcome%20to%20FD3D%21-2713">Felicia Day's original post</a>, I was interested in how she had stated "[she] didn't have a 3D printer at the time, not because [she] didn't want one, but because [she] was intimidated."</p>

<p>Day explained that she had been researching getting a 3D printer, but found examples of places like Reddit where people might ask simple questions like, "How do you get the file into your printer?" and the answers she saw were extremely antagonistic.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing with that stupid comment? There's so many resources on the web,' and I'm like, 'Oh, this is why it's hard to get into this.' You need a doorway opened to you and because I didn't have those training wheels [...] it was really tough," she said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/feliciaday3d-minis-from-twitter_0.jpg?itok=dlzdW5NK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/feliciaday3d-minis-from-twitter_0.jpg?itok=29NXOtZd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Codex and Vork as created by <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/Moonlight%20Minis">Moonlight Minis</a></figcaption></figure><p>Day ran through all of the prep work she put into learning to use her 3D printer, including watching hours of YouTube content on how to set it up, or that I need desiccant in my AMS.</p>

<p>"I feel like I'm a smart person but it's not obvious, there's so many little steps that aren't in the manual," she said. "I'm not about to become a YouTube person to train people on how to do this [...] but I will say the inspiration to get me into the space wasn't there, so I would love to be that person."</p>

<p>Discussing further the differences between her Bamboo X1 Carbon which uses filament and the Anycubic Photon that I have, I couldn't agree with Day more on how complicated the process could be and that my purchase was driven because of the minimal assembly requirement.</p>

<h2>The Creators Behind the Project</h2>

<p>Day was immediately able to show off one of the pieces from FeliciaDay3D, a necklace piece she was wearing that she created with <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/kaizen3dprints">Kaizen 3D</a> prints. While the version Day was wearing was black, she was also able to show off the Mother's Day version that is printed in different blues and greens.</p>

<p>"That's the great thing about 3D printing," she said. "You can take the recipe and you can tweak it to be however you want."</p>

<p>An aspect of FeliciaDay3D that I did have to compliment was that each product image clearly stated the designer's name and the descriptions also all link to the creator's Thangs profile page. Day even pointed out to me that on the bases of the creations, there were the creator's initials so even after printing that credit can be found.</p>



<p>"I'm not into modeling and am collaborating doing mood boards or inspiration boards and then we go back and forth," Day described.</p>

<p>Talking about how Day connected with each of these creators, the full credit went to Thangs. "[They] approached me to do this project and I had been very wary to do big collaborative projects with people ever since Geek &amp; Sundry, I was really burnt out mentally and physically," she said. "It's been five years since I left it and I've been doing my own stuff. [...] Because it's an area I really wanted to get into, because my daughter is really into it.</p>

<p>"Paul from Thangs approached me [...] and was like, 'Hey, you seem to have a huge passion for this, [...] here's a printer, let's get started and we will facilitate the relationship that you have with these designers.'"</p>

<p>Day walked me through the process from the beginning where certain creators were pitched to her, and she found different art and minis that she liked the look of. Today, she spends daily time looking at creators' work, trying to find a way that FeliciaDay3D can benefit while also providing full credit to the creators to create a "circulatory system where we all rise to the top."</p>

<p>Day spoke about how approaching 3D printing with these designers has also helped to reinvigorate a passion that she thought she had lost.</p>

<p>"Quite frankly, I was totally burnt out on my show <em>The Guild</em>, it's been like eight years since I worked on it," she said. "The fact that I worked with Christine (Moonlight Minis) to recreate these guys and write description I realized I'm not as burnt out on them as I thought."</p>

<h2>Who is FeliciaDay3D for?</h2>

<p>To focus in on what type of person should be keeping an eye out on her page, Day simply explained that "there are three different demographics of things we're doing because they're my personal interests: Cosplay &amp; Jewelry, Minis, and Toys to make with your kids."</p>

<p>For Day it was important that the designs created for FeliciaDay3D were accessible to people new to the space.</p>

<p>"I have a passion for taking something that's a little bit inaccessible and making it more public for people to get into," she said. "We do have prints that are 30 minutes and they're out, one color and you're done. But then you can do the necklace, which is printed onto fabric, or print minis on your resin printer."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/feliciaday3d-articulated-spider.jpg?itok=-MI2nJCU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/feliciaday3d-articulated-spider.jpg?itok=tiFULvx7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/Mimetics3D">articulating spider with locking joints from Mimetics3D</a></figcaption></figure><p>As we discussed the different options, Day held up her necklace once more, as well as other prints available on her page, including Vork from <em>the Guild</em> in a small display case and an articulated spider wearing a party hat.</p>

<h2>Subscription Benefits and Future Releases</h2>

<p>For subscribers to FeliciaDay3D, you'll be able to get access to new creations every month. Each month Day plans to add two minis, more jewelry, and toys. There is also a subscription tier that allows for the reselling of printed minis from FeliciaDay3D.</p>

<p>For next month, Day was able to reveal to me that there would be two more members of<em> The Guild</em> who would be added to the page, as well as astrology pendants for Gemini, Leo, and Virgo. Next month would also have a charity initiative added to coincide with Day's birthday. For all purchases of the charity print, a substantial portion would be donated to charity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After completing adding minis for <em>The Guild</em> and the Axis of Anarchy, Day teased that she has another project she's interested in for minis. Day thought to herself, "Wouldn't it be cool to see a mini like that," and now there are plans to not just create those minis but even write a module around it.</p>



<h2>3D Printing Is Still A New Space</h2>

<p>Day is hoping, as her platform grows, that she can reach out to designers who might not be in the 3D space for collaborations. "I'd love to work with jewelry designers or RPG and Tabletop who work in other mediums. Maybe it's the step that they need to get into the space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is about collaboration, exploration, and creativity. Wherever we can make cool things with technology, I want to be there."&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking more to her personal history being on the forefront of technology, Day explained, "<em>The Guild</em> took off because we were one of the first shows on YouTube, the iPhone came out the year later and blew up social media. Being early in tech is something I have a passion for because it's the most creatively fertile time.</p>

<p>"Now I think 3D Printers are accessible enough that that can be a tool for people, and I am excited to be along for the ride," she said.</p>

<p>While only able to offer things that she is the IP holder of, Day also had some interesting observations about licensed product from franchises like <em>Pokemon </em>or <em>Harry Potter</em> that are so present on 3D model websites.</p>

<p>"I think as the fan projects get out there, it's going to become more high profile and push the companies to satisfy the need of the people," she said. "Maybe they'll discover new aspects of their own IP because of fans. I love it when grass roots push bigger companies to change.</p>

<p>"Of course, probably in 5-10 years the big companies will say, 'We're going to take over,' but the stronger the individual creators are now, the more power they'll have when that inevitably happens."</p>



<h2>Empowering Her Daughter and Other Women Interested in 3D Printing</h2>

<p>One thing that Day wanted to make sure fans of hers understand from this project is that "it's really not as hard as it looks."</p>

<p>"The reputation is a lot more engineering based [...] but once the technology becomes more accessible to a plug-and-play kind of mind, then people are going to come in and approach it from a different way," she said.</p>

<p>"One of the first things I printed, I got a jam, I was printing two filaments that shouldn't have gone together," Day said. "I did get a warning, but I was like 'meh' and it got a clog. I was like, 'Felicia, calm down this is mechanical, people do this all the time,' and I took everything apart.</p>

<p>"Some people are like 'eye roll, you used a wrench' but yeah this is a big deal for me. The fact that I was able to get that thing unstuck without asking for any help was so liberating, and I felt powerful and then I made something with it."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that I was able to get that thing unstuck without asking for any help was so liberating and I felt powerful."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Day revealed that the first thing she printed was the Pokemon<em> </em>Wooper for her daughter; the second attempt was successful and she was "Mom of the Year."</p>

<p>Day joked that replacing everything in her house with a 3D print is not her life passion, but she does want to create pretty things. "Getting others, especially women and girls, into a place that's very male-dominated" is also important for Day.</p>

<p>She did remark that there was no specific intent behind it, but that's "just who I am." Her aim is to be the person at the door to let others in and show that it can be very fun.</p>

<p>"The earlier you get a kid into it the better, so we can have more girls like my little girl coming home and saying, 'I love making things Mama, I want to build things, I want to design my own things.' That's going to lead to all kinds of benefits down the line," she said.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of layers going on, and at the end of the day, I just want to make a spider wearing a party hat."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It was early August 2021 when former Elder Scrolls Arena and Elder Scrolls Daggerfall developers Ted Peterson and Julian LeFay <a href="https://wccftech.com/open-world-fantasy-rpg-the-wayward-realms-briefly-showcased-made-by-ex-elder-scrolls-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> they had partnered to create The Wayward Realms at their new studio, OnceLost Games.</p>
<p>Nearly three years later, the developers have just <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise funds for their 'Grand RPG', which aims to hearken back to the old-school of games like Daggerfall, which featured massive open worlds and a strong emphasis on choices and consequences.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the campaign has already earned nearly half the minimum funding goal of $500K. With 29 days left, The Wayward Realms will likely be funded, and there may even be space for some stretch goals, which are currently set for $800K, $1 million, $1.5 million, and $2 million, with the last one including multiplayer support.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Kickstarter campaign, we sent a few questions to OnceLost Games to discuss their approach to the project and the main features you can expect to see when it lands in early access next year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life of An Adventurer - A Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3XXGVCEhNI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><strong>As far as I can see, Julian hasn't worked in the industry for a long time. Why did he choose to come back now?</strong></p>
<p>After Julian did an interview about The Elder Scrolls with Indigo Gaming, Ted Peterson reached out to Indigo and did an interview as well. Through him, Julian and Ted got back in touch with each other and began talking about what they would have done had they continued working more hands on with the series. Eventually, they decided to give it a try, and thus, OnceLost Games was born.</p>
<p><strong>OnceLost Games was founded in 2019. Were you affected by the COVID pandemic, leading to a delay in the development process?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest effects were on team members' personal lives which did lead to a rough start for the company. It was early on enough that there wasn’t any delay, per se, but things did take a little longer to get going.</p>
<p><strong>What's the project's status, and how many developers do you have currently?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently a team of around 40 members. We are still in early production with the aim of the Kickstarter campaign allowing us to work full time for a year to get an early access version of the game out to supporters.</p>
<p><strong>You're now looking to create an early access build of The Wayward Realms with the funds from the Kickstarter. How long do you expect it to take before this build can go live in early access following the end of the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Our aim is for an early access release sometime in 2025, but it is hard to nail down a more specific date at this time as some of that will be affected by how much we manage to raise.</p>
<p><strong>Moreover, do you have an estimate for how long the game will stay in early access before the full launch?</strong></p>
<p>That will depend on how easily we are able to find additional funding after the early access launch.</p>
<p><strong>The Wayward Realms is being billed as a spiritual successor to The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. That game's biggest achievement was arguably its procedural generation, which, in some ways, may still be unmatched by modern games. Why do you think that is the case, and how will you advance it with this new game?</strong></p>
<p>Daggerfall’s open world is often cited as wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle, which is something that can certainly happen when procedural generation is implemented in a simple form. This probably scares off most developers who would rather have a smaller, more detailed world for their players to engage with. However, we feel that there are plenty of ways to advance the procedural generation and integrate more memorable interactions and encounters within it.<br>
We are also taking advantage of procedural generation in order to be able to change things within the world, such as a town being burned down to the ground as a result of the political struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5.3's Procedural Content Generation feature? In general, how can a cutting-edge game-making tool like UE5 empower your work?</strong></p>
<p>We have not upgraded to 5.3 yet, but we do plan to. In the end we will take advantage of some of that systems features, but will primarily be sticking with our own, as we are needing the proc gen to work at runtime and we are also creating a curvature to the world, so that as you sail or climb a high location, then you can see distant landmarks come into view properly.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the virtual Game Master?</strong></p>
<p>The VGM is meant to work like a real life tabletop game master would, tailoring the game around the player, who/what they are playing as, and what they enjoy doing. For instance, a player who collects books may be offered more quests with books as a reward to entice them. Meanwhile, a melee-focused player may be offered more challenges based on their melee skills. The idea is to track what the player is doing and avoid offering more of what the player is not doing.</p>
<p>The VGM is also in charge of creating new quests for players, taking into account recent events, NPCs that the player has interacted with, and what factions the player is allied with and against in order to fill in the variables in potential quests. This helps make the game more relevant to the player in each playthrough.</p>
<p><strong>You've stated that, in a way, there is no main quest in your game. Given that, is it fair to say the game has no specific end, and events will continue to unfold without limit?</strong></p>
<p>There is no main quest, but we do have major World Events that occur throughout a playthrough. They act as sort of an overarching narrative. There are also questlines for each of the major factions. With both of these there will be a sort of finality to a narrative for players, but they can continue to play one beyond them, and the VGMs will continue to create new adventures for the player to experience.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game feature Radiant AI-like proc-gen quests, and if so, how do you plan to make them more interesting?</strong></p>
<p>There will be a lot of procedurally generated quests. Part of the goal for the VGM is to make sure they are interesting to the player by including recent events and NPC &amp; Faction interactions in order to keep them relevant. We are also building quests in a 5 act structure, thus making sure that they have a proper narrative beat and can be more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of AI, what do you think about generative AI NPCs? Could they make RPGs more interesting, especially for side content?</strong></p>
<p>It is something we are exploring, but in order to ensure that they would fit the world, they would have to have some strict limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe how spellcrafting will work in The Wayward Realms?</strong></p>
<p>We are not ready to go into depth about it, but part of the gameplay loop of being a mage is seeking out new words to use in spell creation. Different combinations will allow for various effects and more rare words will lead to more powerful spells.</p>
<p><strong>Since the game is set in an archipelago and ships have been confirmed, will there be ship combat? What about any content under the sea (e.g., explorable ruins)?</strong></p>
<p>Ship combat is something we are still discussing. There is no gunpowder in our world, so cannons would not fit. We do also want undersea exploration, but that is something we have yet to touch on with our procedural systems. Both to be determined.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned traditional 'click-to-attack combat'. Is that a reference to MMO-style 'tab targeting'?</strong></p>
<p>No, we mean the difference between today’s combat, where clicking the mouse button results in an attack, and Daggerfall-style combat, where the mouse is dragged in order to produce a swing.</p>
<p><strong>When describing 'directional combat', you referred to mouse and keyboard. Are you also going to support gamepads? Will this mode support manual aiming of bows and spells and other action elements like dodging, blocking, et cetera?</strong></p>
<p>We do already support gamepads even in this early stage. Bows and spells are aimed manually in both instances. Dodging and kicking are bound to specific keys. Blocking can be affected by the direction inputs.</p>
<p><strong>For those who aren't fond of combat, is it possible to be a crafter-type character who sends companions and allies to do their dirty work?</strong></p>
<p>There will be non-combat options, such as dialogue options. Companions are something we would like, but we are not sure if we will get in on time yet.</p>
<p><strong>In a previous interview from 2021, you said there might be a lot of reading in the game due to budget constraints. Has that changed at all (e.g., will there be more voice acting than anticipated)?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don’t really plan for voice acting besides some greetings, grunts, background noise, and battle cries. The procedural nature of some quests, as well as how much dialogue we have planned, makes having full voice acting virtually impossible. We might have text-to-speech available as more of an accessibility option.</p>
<p><strong>Similarly, you mentioned romances and the like would not be a focus. Is that still the case?</strong></p>
<p>It is something we are exploring, but nothing is set in stone yet.</p>
<p><strong>I know you've said the main goal of The Wayward Realms is to restore the design philosophies of classic RPGs. However, I wanted to ask if there's anything you'd like to borrow from the best examples of most recent RPGs, like Baldur's Gate 3. What do you think about Larian's game and its overwhelming success?</strong></p>
<p>We have many huge fans of the game and Larian themselves on the team. Ultimately, BG3 is a different type of game than what we are making, but some inspiration has undoubtedly seeped in here or there.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any mini-games in The Wayward Realms?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we do plan some different types of tavern games, such as card or board games, as well as some tourney type games like jousting or dueling, and of course the ever-requested fishing mini game will make an appearance.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about Bethesda's latest game, Starfield? Some players thought the usual sense of exploration found in a Bethesda game was kinda lost in it. Was it simply inevitable due to it being set in space (and, as such, locations had to be spread across many planets)?</strong></p>
<p>The game was enjoyable but took a different approach to procedural generation from ours. We feel it would have benefited from having some Daggerfall-esque “dungeon” generation instead of reusing premade dungeons.</p>
<p><strong>Bethesda is now working on The Elder Scrolls VI, and there's a chance the full version of The Wayward Realms may be released in its vicinity. How would you feel about that?</strong></p>
<p>We are not really sure what the release dates for either game will ultimately be, but we don’t mind if we release alongside. There really is a big difference in the two games’ design philosophies and we think there is room for both. Some players will gravitate more towards one than the other, and we think that having the option is great.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to bring The Wayward Realms to consoles eventually?</strong></p>
<p>We would certainly love to, but right now, we are solely focused on getting this out on PC.</p>
<p><strong>The Steam page currently lists very low minimum requirements, especially for the GPU. Are those meant to be placeholders, or are they accurate for the time being?</strong></p>
<p>They are simply placeholders, as Steam requires something to be filled in. We will release more accurate specs as we near launch.</p>
<p><strong>Will The Wayward Realms eventually be available on all major PC stores (Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store)?</strong></p>
<p>We do plan on it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the industry's current state, with countless games vying for users' attention, mass layoffs, and rising development budgets?</strong></p>
<p>It is sad to see studios being shuttered and games being canceled. Hopefully things can pick back up relatively quickly. It does open up more room for indies, so that can be taken as a plus.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/selaco-sets-a-new-standard-for-the-fps-genre.886290/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10">10/10 score</a> from <em>TechRaptor</em> is a rare honor reserved for only the best of the best, and we take great care to scrutinize every aspect of a game deserving of this score. Believe me when I say, then, that I would fight tooth and nail for <em>Selaco</em> to receive such a distinction, were it not <em>just </em>releasing in Early Access.</p>

<p>As it stands, <em>Selaco</em> is one of the most original and innovative retro-inspired shooters to hit the market in quite some time, with a cornucopia of highly polished mechanics and fresh ideas. It even has a full episode available to play on Early Access now, and that already feels like a full product in and of itself. <em>Selaco</em> is setting the bar for shooters ludicrously high.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-guns-1.jpg?itok=xwREw6M7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-guns-1.jpg?itok=AnaZa1j- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ol' reliable, this gun. Keep it loaded.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco</em>'s Introduction is Thrilling and Engrossing</h2>

<p><em>Selaco </em>takes notes from some of my favorite shooters -- there are hints of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/halo">Halo</a>,</em> a hearty helping of <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, some <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/doom"><em>Doom </em></a>DNA of course (it runs on GZDoom, for goodness' sake), and several others. Even so, it's a first-person shooter that feels like its own thing rather than imitating its inspirations. As a result, it's undeniably the most fun I've had with an FPS campaign in years.</p>

<p>The action ramps up right from the start as <em>Selaco</em>'s main character, Dawn, wakes up in her hospital bed, and all has gone to hell in a handbasket. Your first moments as Dawn are a desperate rush to find a weapon as an unknown force attacks anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in its way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-weapon-sprites.jpg?itok=rGVq1iO8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-weapon-sprites.jpg?itok=pqOwNGZu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Weapon models look excellent. I wouldn't want to be at the end of this shotgun.</figcaption></figure><p>This took me back to Master Chief's mad dash to Captain Keyes in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, a moment seared into my brain. Eventually, you find your weapon and it's all gas, no breaks from start to finish. The moment you grab that rifle, a team of soldiers clad in tactical armor start breaching the door and rush in.</p>

<p>As you fight your way out of this situation, you'll gather up armor that gives Dawn a slide and dash, and come across many other weapons, too. The gunplay, and by extension, the enemies you fight, is where <em>Selaco</em> sets itself apart. Every single weapon, from your ridiculously powerful pistol to a gun that blasts nails at high speeds is a powerhouse that looks and feels incredible to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-firefight-2.jpg?itok=Y2I4894P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-firefight-2.jpg?itok=ZXqyPzLG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When in doubt, spray bullets in their face.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco's </em>AI is Smart and Lethal</h2>

<p>With the mobility added by your suit, combat is fast and deadly. Enemies are lethal and a miscalculation will quite literally mean your death. This isn't the type of FPS where you're taking on dozens of enemies in the same room; rather, <em>Selaco</em> uses highly intelligent, efficient killing squads as the primary enemy.</p>

<p>As such, the AI in <em>Selaco</em> is one of the most advanced I've come across in a shooter. This is where you can see the <em>F.E.A.R. </em>inspiration, with enemies calling out tactics to their comrades and reacting to the player's actions. Some squads are more aggressive than others, while others will be more hesitant to engage if you push. Hide in a corner, though, and you bet they'll be on you in no time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sniper.jpg?itok=zn1Z7_li 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sniper.jpg?itok=dP_UYuRx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The enemy is tactically taking cover, but we'll see if he can stand a sniper bullet.</figcaption></figure><p>There are few games that capture the intensity of a gunfight, but <em>Selaco</em> does that. Not that I've ever <em>been</em> in a firefight myself, but the gunplay and AI go a long way to make things feel immersive. Things get <em>very</em> chaotic in these gunfights, as there is clutter everywhere. Just about every object can be shot and explodes in a violent fashion, and the smoke and debris from the chaos can limit your field of vision.</p>

<p>In a stroke of brilliance, <em>Selaco</em> gradually ups the ante of these firefights by its inclusion of "Invasion Tiers." As you progress throughout the campaign, enemies are upgraded with more abilities and armaments. Therefore, even though you might see similar enemies throughout, there's almost always going to be something new to contend with. As a result, <em>Selaco</em> feels fresh from start to finish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-map.jpg?itok=Te2cpTca 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-map.jpg?itok=MOizc6pS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The maps in Selaco are especially helpful and mark crucial points.</figcaption></figure><h2>Collectibles and Other Fun Tasks in <em>Selaco</em></h2>

<p>Levels are intricate and meticulously detailed in <em>Selaco</em>. From the starting hospital to the abandoned, sci-fi streets of&nbsp;the eponymous Selaco, you'll explore numerous environments that I couldn't help but stop and gawk at. There are so many hidden secrets and collectibles in these vast complexes. Despite the ambitious scope of such levels, I never felt lost, which is a testament to <em>Selaco</em>'s level design.</p>

<p>After firefights, I'd run around and explore these environments. <em>Selaco</em> certainly embraces those with an intrepid spirit. You'll be surprised by what you find; weapon upgrades, caches of ammo, various currencies, and more. Weapon upgrades often come in the form of a new alt-fire for your guns, so there's more variation to your roster of 8 or so weapons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-challenges.jpg?itok=QqxLPcgh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-challenges.jpg?itok=yOoHoDW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll find that you are rewarded for your efforts.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, it's great to explore since you can upgrade weapons further at safe houses scattered throughout <em>Selaco</em>'s campaign. Weapon parts are hidden throughout, and this is the primary currency you'll use to fund your customization. Increasing the damage of your weapons or altering the accuracy, recoil, and behavior of weapons is essential when faced with an ever-evolving enemy.</p>

<p>While I normally don't care all that much about searching for secrets, <em>Selaco</em> makes the hunt especially fun and rewarding. Often, this game rewards your ingenuity. Stacking chairs to get to a high ledge or crawling through a series of vents does not go unrewarded.</p>

<p>Besides that, players progress the more they play, plain and simple: <em>Selaco</em> has a series of milestones that reward the player with weapon parts. Often, these milestones ask you to kill a certain number of enemies or break a specific amount of walls. It's another way for players to get a sense of progression and gratification as they shoot their way to victory.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-upgrades.jpg?itok=46Aaa2Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-upgrades.jpg?itok=lTHsnbsr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upgrade weapons to your liking, provided you have the dosh.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco</em>'s Running on <em>that</em> Engine?</h2>

<p>Believe me when I say <em>Selaco</em> is a technical marvel. No, I'm not a game dev, but consider this:<em> </em>this game<em> </em>is running on a modified <em>Doom </em>engine, known as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/supplice-works-some-gzdoom-magic">GZDoom</a>. GZDoom games usually come with a noticeably retro look, but <em>Selaco</em> has a fine balance of retro and modern elements. This creates a wholly original style, so there's nothing that is quite like <em>Selaco </em>on the market, visually speaking.</p>

<p>Altered Orbit must have done some dark magic to make <em>Selaco</em> look and play the way it does. Running on GZDoom, you'd think it would play a bit like <em>Doom </em>or boomer shooters, right? That's simply not the case, here. I cannot begin to imagine the amount of work it took to accomplish such a feat, but I can at least appreciate the developer's ingenuity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-pool.jpg?itok=cVKAk4tO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-pool.jpg?itok=YglPNdfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enjoy yourself a game of pool, why don't ya.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems like almost every object in <em>Selaco</em> is one you can interact with. The arcade machines have actual games on them, and hell, I played pool at a bar in between firefights. There are random bits of food that can heal you, and office supplies you can chuck at enemies if you'd like, too. The bathrooms? Well, they're fully functional, toilet, sink, soap dispenser, and all.</p>

<p>The result of these efforts is a treat for both the eyes and ears. In fact, the soundtrack is simply superb. It has this slick, electronic vibe that fits oh so well with the science-fiction aesthetic. I would get so hyped up when a squad of enemies was coming my way, and you have this fantastic, adrenaline-pumping soundtrack complementing the intensity of the combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-nailgun_1.jpg?itok=JpaeIM38 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-nailgun_1.jpg?itok=suN6INOt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nails shot at high velocity. Ouch.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There's a lot more I could say about <em>Selaco</em>, and all of it is positive. Again, you might be reading this and forget that this is an Early Access game -- it's not technically Version 1.0. With Episode 2 marking the completion of Early Access and a third episode following that, I cannot wait to see what else <em>Selaco</em> has in store.</p>

<p>If you'd rather wait 'til its out of Early Access, you're doing yourself a disservice. Go and play <em>Selaco</em> now. You won't regret it.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Selaco </strong>was previewed on PC via Steam Early Access with a code provided by the developer over roughly 15 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

<h2 id="24DuNp"><strong>Barely Even Friends by Mae Bennett</strong></h2>
<h3 id="UWG237"><strong>June 4</strong></h3>
<p id="Ow8RYM">If you’re in the mood to read a steamy, contemporary retelling of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, look no further than Mae Bennett’s debut romance novel, <em>Barely Even Friends</em>. </p>
<p id="rWhtk7">A contractor by trade and expert in all things to do with home renovation, Bellamy Price is determined to get a leg up and prove herself in a typically male-dominated field. Luckily, the perfect opportunity presents itself when she’s offered a job working on the palatial and mysterious Killington Estate. Expecting the house to be empty upon her arrival, Bellamy is shocked to discover it’s occupied by none other than Oliver Killington, recluse and heir to the vast Killington empire, who happens to have a very convenient <em>thing</em> for suspenders. Though frustratingly obstinate at first, it quickly becomes clear that there’s more to Oliver than meets the eye, and a common enemy quickly brings him and Bellamy closer together than either are expecting. </p>

<h2 id="IYX29g"><strong>Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky</strong></h2>
<h3 id="7NNJ0y"><strong>June 4</strong></h3>
<p id="kzTxMJ">From the author of <em>Elder Race</em> and <em>Children of Time</em> comes a new, surprisingly funny and deeply philosophical sci-fi novel about a murderous robot valet by the name of Charles that’s perfect for fans of <em>I, Robot</em> and <em>Jeeves</em>. </p>
<p id="cy5fYC">When Charles, a robot valet meticulously designed to be at the right hand of any modern human, gets the idea to murder their master — and subsequently does — they’re forced to go on the run, something they never thought they’d be able to do. Charles quickly discovers that the world is much larger than the home they worked in, and that they’re not the only robot discovering their independence. </p>

<h2 id="aOtkCx"><strong>The Stardust Grail by Yume Kitasei</strong></h2>
<h3 id="qchmQW"><strong>June 11</strong></h3>
<p id="a6DwIO">It’s hard not to be incredibly excited about <em>The Stardust Grail</em>, a book that’s pitched as an anti-colonial space heist with a protagonist who returns stolen artifacts to the alien civilizations they belong to rather than keeping them for herself or putting them behind glass in a museum. </p>
<p id="nMsqNO">Set ten years after a job goes horribly wrong, Maya Hoshimoto — once considered to be the galaxy’s best art thief — is approached by an old friend with an offer she can’t refuse: track down an powerful alien artifact. The catch? The artifact in question might not actually exist, and if it does, its discovery could lead to the end of human civilization as we know it. </p>

<p id="WGqWfN">If you, like me, read Robin Sloan’s delightful novel, <em>Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, and thought to yourself, “That was strange,” then you might want to hold onto your hat. </p>
<p id="ffWUHR">Set 13,000 years in the future, <em>Moonbound</em> tells the story of Ariel, a boy who lives in a town under the control of a wizard. When Ariel accidentally stumbles across an important piece of record-keeping technology from the past, he finds himself called to adventure and a mission to save the world. </p>

<h2 id="64lW0p"><strong>The Art Of Catching Feelings by Alicia Thompson</strong></h2>
<h3 id="K0zoYu"><strong>June 18</strong></h3>
<p id="xsrtMA">What better time to read a romance novel about baseball than during the height of summer? </p>
<p id="EeGVS8">In Alicia Thompson’s novel, <em>The Art of Catching Feelings</em>, a professional baseball player and his number one heckler navigate a delightful enemies-to-lovers romance. When Daphne Brink takes her taunting a little too far, driving Chris Kepler to literal tears during the middle of a game, she reaches out over social media to apologize. When Chris messages her back, it quickly becomes clear that he doesn’t know who Daphne is, and their relationship begins to grow into more than a few sweet DMs. But as the season progresses and their feelings for one another become undeniable, Daphne realizes she might not be able to keep her true identity from Chris forever. </p>

<h2 id="U7qJSw"><strong>The Daughters’ War by Christopher Buehlman</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1hGfWI"><strong>June 25</strong></h3>
<p id="rJTNm7">I have been counting down the days until the release of <em>The Daughters’ War</em> since I first caught wind that Christopher Buehlman would be writing a prequel to his fantastic fantasy novel, <em>The Blacktongue Thief</em>. Rather than return to the lush world that he’s crafted with a sequel (we’ll see Kinch again eventually), Buehlman is taking readers back in time with a tale about Galva as she rides into battle against goblins on the back of her war-corvid. </p>

<h2 id="hXH8hp"><strong>The God of the Woods by Liz Moore</strong></h2>
<h3 id="iMjSB0"><strong>July 2</strong></h3>
<p id="O7n6Mz">Set in the Adirondack Mountains during the late summer of 1975, <em>The God of the Woods</em> tells the story of 13-year-old Barbara Van Laar, who vanishes from her bunk overnight while at summer camp. Barbara isn’t just any camper though, and this isn’t the first time a Van Laar has gone missing. Sixteen years ago, Barbara’s older brother also vanished too, never to be seen again. </p>
<p id="qbRJH3">This is a gorgeously written and tragic tale with a non-linear plot that jumps through time from the 1950s to the 1970s as Moore transports her readers, weaving a rich and complicated tapestry. </p>

<h2 id="UrNiXi"><strong>The Undermining of Twyla and Frank by Megan Bannen</strong></h2>
<h3 id="8ulDoU"><strong>July 2</strong></h3>
<p id="RGhs2f">Hot off the heels of her first heartwarming romance novel, <em>The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy</em>, Megan Bannen returns to the magical world of Tanria with its friends-to-lovers sequel, <em>The Undermining of Twyla and Frank</em>. </p>
<p id="UBUDZ8">It’s fair to say the entire town of Eternity was shocked when Twyla Banneker, middle-aged and a widow, joined her best friend, Frank Ellis, to be a Tanrian marshal. But, eight years later, Twyla is still at it (and very good at her job, to boot). Her life takes a sudden and exciting turn when she and Frank discover the dead body of one of their fellow marshals covered in — of all things — glitter. As Twyla and Frank are drawn further into the mystery afoot, it becomes increasingly clear that the two are much more than just work partners. </p>

<h2 id="ZFWEaA"><strong>Pink Slime by Fernanda Trías </strong></h2>
<h3 id="Rw0gnS"><strong>July 2</strong></h3>
<p id="wc8pZs">Set in a not-to-distant future in which the world has been utterly devastated by a plague, <em>Pink Slime</em> by Fernanda Trías is a deeply distressing but compulsively readable work of climate fiction. </p>
<p id="mtFf0t">When a mysterious algae bloom poisons the air blowing inland from the ocean, a nameless corporation develops a vile pink food substance — think Pepto Bismol crossed with Soylent Green — for everyone to eat. As the end of the world grows ever closer and society continues to collapse, one woman in particular — the narrator of this story — refuses to leave the family and friends she loves behind, clinging to the life she once knew. </p>

<h2 id="xz8lK8"><strong>Toward Eternity by Anton Hur </strong></h2>
<h3 id="KBFiF9"><strong>July 9</strong></h3>
<p id="oxNyYQ">Already a force to be reckoned with in the world of literary translation, Anton Hur’s upcoming novel, <em>Toward Eternity</em>, is a brilliant and thought provoking examination of what it means to be human. </p>
<p id="3TelnI">Told in the form of journal entries that connect characters across centuries, <em>Toward Eternity</em> is set in a world where cancerous cells can be replaced by nanites — robotic cells — effectively eradicating the disease. It’s nothing short of a miracle. At the same time, a literary researcher and the doctor who holds the patent to nano-technology join forces to place an AI program into a physical, robotic form, effectively giving it bodily autonomy and bringing mortality and humanity into question in the process. </p>

<h2 id="pEnvd1"><strong>Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi </strong></h2>
<h3 id="OgRwEa"><strong>July 9</strong></h3>
<p id="Wj0QCj">Fans of <em>Windup Girl</em>, <em>The Water Knife</em>, and <em>Shipbreaker</em>, rejoice! An exciting new science fiction title from Paolo Bacigalupi is hitting shelves in July. </p>
<p id="CfrL2V">Set in an Italian Renaissance-inspired world, <em>Navolo</em> is a mashup of literary scifi/fantasy and historical fiction that tells the story of Davico di Regulai, a young lord set to take over his family’s vast empire. The di Regulai family are wealthy beyond belief and have influenced the rise and fall of politicians and great cities alike, but not everything in the city of Navola is as it seems. When Davico discovers the existence of a fossilized dragon eye — a symbol of raw power that is pictured on <em>Navola’s</em> excellent cover — he finds that there are few he can trust, including members of his own family. </p>

<h2 id="vJqxLe"><strong>The Sky On Fire by Jenn Lyons</strong></h2>
<h3 id="IbLMVW"><strong>July 9</strong></h3>
<p id="O42yxv">Billed as <em>Dragonriders of Pern</em> but for modern readers, <em>The Sky on Fire</em> promises to be exactly what fans of <em>Temeraire</em>, <em>Fourth Wing</em>, and even Patricia C. Wrede’s beloved <em>Dealing With Dragons</em> are craving. </p>
<p id="8eNOOE">After being saved from a local warlord by a group of unlikely adventuring misfits — picture an average D&amp;D party — Anahrod realizes that her new companions are determined to reach the cloud cities and the immense dragon’s hoard located there.  The only problem with this plan is that the hoard belongs to Neveranimas, and Neveranimas wants nothing more than to see Anahrod dead. </p>

<h2 id="0SPWeH"><strong>Nicked by M.T. Anderson </strong></h2>
<h3 id="dhPNLg"><strong>July 23</strong></h3>
<p id="1D18sR">If there’s one thing about M.T. Anderson, it’s that he’s going to write a book with a plot that’s as delightful and captivating as it is downright strange. His adult debut <em>Nicked</em> is no exception. </p>
<p id="EQinH9">In the year 1801, the Italian port city of Bari is wracked by a plague, and a monk by the name of Brother Nicephorus is visited by Saint Nicholas in his dreams. His superiors don’t believe him, but Tyun, a treasure hunter, does and the two soon hit the road to collect Saint Nicholas’s bones and the mysterious liquid they rest in, which is rumored to heal the sick. What follows is a heist that is complex and action packed enough to make even the likes of Steven Soderbergh jealous. </p>

<h2 id="xik4N6"><strong>Long Live Evil by Sarah Rees Brennan </strong></h2>
<h3 id="rUxOpc"><strong>July 30</strong></h3>
<p id="3zzVje">Sarah Rees Brennan’s adult debut,<em> Long Live Evil</em>, proves that sometimes it feels good to be a little bad. </p>
<p id="QfzaNW">Rae is dying, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. As her world comes crumbling down around her, she makes a last ditch magical bargain that transports her to the court of her favorite fictional character, the Once and Forever Emperor. The catch? Rae isn’t the hero of this story. Quite the opposite, in fact. As the emperor becomes increasingly violent, Rae assembles an unlikely team of villainous allies who deserve a much better ending than the one originally written for them. </p>

<h2 id="Injzmw"><strong>The Mercy of Gods by James S.A. Corey</strong></h2>
<h2 id="6NLxzX"><strong>August 6</strong></h2>
<p id="WOfdXd">James S.A. Corey, the dynamic duo behind the phenomenal series, <em>The Expanse</em>, is back once again for a brand new, utterly epic sci-fi adventure. </p>
<p id="P6jV76">For generations, the Carryx — a combination of an empire and a hive — have waged wars and enslaved alien species across the galaxy. They are a force to be reckoned with to say the least, but when they finally meet their match, it becomes clear that the best and brightest humans living on the planet Anjiin are the only ones who can save them. The result is a gripping tale of survival, rebellion, and hope. </p>

<h2 id="g94KaF"><strong>Loving, Ohio by Matthew Erman and illustrated by Sam Beck </strong></h2>
<h3 id="63vUFW"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="4CM11b">It’s safe to say that <em>Loving, Ohio</em> — written by Matthew Erman and gorgeously illustrated by Sam Beck — is my favorite horror graphic novel that I’ve read since Emily Carroll’s In <em>The Woods</em>. It’s a perfectly balanced mix of punk rock, small town coming-of-age, and bone chilling, nightmare fueling dread. </p>
<p id="vLHj98">After the shocking suicide of their friend, four teens are grief stricken, unmoored, and counting down the days until high school comes to an end. There’s not much for them in Loving anyways, besides the mysterious new age cult known as the Chorus that has taken root there. When tragedy strikes again, the group can’t help but wonder if the Chorus is somehow behind it, and one in particular, Sloane, is hell-bent on finding out the truth, no matter the coast. </p>

<h2 id="EISzbQ"><strong>A Sorceress Comes to Call by T Kingfisher </strong></h2>
<h3 id="EXHHG9"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="dClvc1">T. Kingfisher has outdone herself once again, proving to sci-fi and fantasy readers alike why she’s one of the best in the biz. A retelling inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairytale <em>Goose Girl</em>, <em>A Sorceress Comes to Call</em> is a bewitching and wildly entertaining adventure. </p>
<p id="HPjKKL">Cordelia has not had an easy life. Raised by a domineering, emotionally manipulative and downright abusive mother in a house without any doors, and with only a beautiful white horse for a friend, Cordelia craves a freedom she’s certain she’ll never have. When a death in town forces the two women to go on the run in the middle of the night, they find themselves seeking shelter with a wealthy man, his unwed sister, Hester, and a squire. When Hester recognizes the pain and torment that Cordelia has suffered, and that Cordelia’s mother isn’t the woman she pretends to be, she becomes determined to save everyone she cares for before it’s too late. </p>

<h2 id="CvQpeQ"><strong>Full Speed to a Crash Landing by Beth Revis </strong></h2>
<h3 id="0noMnU"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="a4DHlE">Having dabbled in the literary side of Star Wars for some time, Beth Revis is no stranger to science fiction, outer space, impossible heists, or romantic tension. Her new novella, <em>Full Speed to a Crash Landing</em> (the first in a trilogy) has all that going for it and more. </p>
<p id="rK7gzg">When readers first meet Ada Lamarr, she’s running out of time. And oxygen. But help soon arrives in the form of a government sanctioned salvage crew. They’re less than thrilled to have her on board as they head to their destination, a secret mission helmed by the delightfully handsome Agent Rian White, but Ada promises to stay out of their hair and out of their business. This, of course, is a lie. But as Ada and Rian spend more time together and their attraction to one another continues to grow, it becomes increasingly unclear who is playing who. </p>

<h3 id="8r6AZP"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="KcgSbo">If you’re in the mood to read a dynamic and brutal horror novel that will have you on the edge of your seat from cover-to-cover, look no further than <em>A Mask of Flies</em> by Matthew Lyons. </p>
<p id="9W6Iwl">After a bank heist goes horribly awry, Anne Heller is forced to hole up in her family’s old cabin with Jessup, her badly wounded partner-in-crime, and Dutch, the police officer they’ve taken hostage. Jessup, unfortunately, doesn’t make it. Anne and Dutch decide to bury his body, only for something that is-but-isn’t Jessup to rise from his grave and try to get back into the cabin. </p>

<h2 id="yGqiu3"><strong>Lady Macbeth by Ava Reid </strong></h2>
<h3 id="xREXYM"><strong>August 13</strong></h3>
<p id="3v9xl7">When it comes to complicated, multi-faceted female characters, Ava Reid reigns supreme, and her upcoming novel, <em>Lady Macbeth</em>, reimagines the story of one of Shakespeare’s most ruthless, unforgiving, power-hungry women. </p>
<p id="P4Ym6T">The Lady knows what her fate holds in store for her. She knows that she is destined to marry a brutish Scot and to drive men to madness. The Lady also knows that sometimes it takes a little witchcraft to get by. What she doesn’t know is that her husband has secrets of his own, including his own ties to the occult. </p>

<h2 id="YVL0mD"><strong>Blackheart Man by Nalo Hopkinson</strong></h2>
<h3 id="iEvBBT"><strong>August 20</strong></h3>
<p id="laJorf">Inspired by Caribbean culture, folklore, and history that deftly blurs the lines between reality and fiction, <em>Blackheart Man</em> by Nalo Hopkinson is a gripping tale of a magical island and the man who will do whatever he can to protect it.</p>
<p id="3kI6Il">Veycosi, a scholar on the island of Cynchin, wants nothing more in the world than the chance to get his hands on the Alamat Book of Light, a tome that contains  knowledge that would ensure his place on his island’s Colloquium. His plans go abruptly sideways when fifteen galleons from a neighboring land arrive, forcing the island and its inhabitants into a trade agreement that proves to be much more dangerous than anticipated.</p>

<h2 id="TCvaXN"><strong>Voyage of the Damned by Frances White </strong></h2>
<h3 id="BFB7dH"><strong>August 20</strong></h3>
<p id="a8jeH0">Now being published in North America for the first time, <em>Voyage of the Damned</em> by Frances White has a little bit of everything. Part <em>And Then There Were None</em>, part fantasy novel, queer as hell, and surprisingly, delightfully romantic, it’s sure to scratch the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>and <em>Our Flag Means Death</em> itch for a lot of readers. </p>
<p id="E4aU1O">The land of Concordia has maintained peace throughout its many provinces for thousands of years. It’s an incredible feat, and to celebrate, the emperor is sending the twelve heirs of the provinces of Concordia, including Ganymedes Piscero (a notorious screw up and general disappointment to his family) on a twelve-day trip. When one of the other heirs turns up dead, Gamymedes knows his only choice is to find out who killed them before he ends up dead as well. </p>

<h3 id="vAgEW3"><strong>August 27</strong></h3>
<p id="YrVWkU">Alexis Hall, author of <em>Boyfriend Material</em>, has done it again! <em>Confounding Oaths</em> is a heartwarming regency romance that will be the perfect book to read while sitting on a beach or by the pool in the late August sun. </p>
<p id="n0zsi7">The year is 1815 and John Caesar is determined to host an incredible coming-out for his younger sister, Mary. Despite his best efforts, John is thwarted in just about every way imaginable; ragtag soldiers, a military cult, and a fairy godmother with ill intention all stand in his way. When Mary is cursed by fairy folk, John is forced to enlist the dashing, handsome, and unfortunately working class Captain James to rescue her. </p>

Now, though, that innocent era has come to an end, and the <em>New York Times</em> is taking legal action against one such game with a very similar name to its popular puzzler. </p><div data-video-id="194028" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Umbran Witch Suplex" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="194028,192610,191339" data-current="194028"><div><p>The Week In Games: Umbran Witch Suplex</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194028/194028_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19503.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>For a few months after <em>Wordle</em>’s breakthrough, <em>Kotaku</em> was gleefully discovering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wordle-today-games-like-alternatives-best-nerdle-heardl-1848782927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-today-games-like-alternatives-best-nerdle-heardl-1848782927">game after game</a></span> that either iterated on the core concept, or took the general themes and applied them to other topics.

<p>During its PlayStation State of Play on May 30, Sony confirmed that God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-coming-to-pc-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on PC later</a> this year. While that’s good news for those waiting to check out the games for the first time, Sony <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/">has confirmed that</a> both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">games require</a> a PSN account to play.</p>



<p>With the requirement of a PSN account, Sony cuts out several regions that have access to Steam for their PC gaming but can’t create a PSN account. </p>



<p>The topic of needing a PSN account to play games on Steam has been a hot debate for some time but picked up steam (no pun intended) when Sony tried to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-now-requires-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enforce the requirement</a> on Helldivers 2 players months after the game’s release. That decision, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-account-linking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a>, would’ve taken the game away from dozens of regions and, likely, thousands of players.</p>



<p>While it’s not unheard of for companies like Sony and Xbox to require accounts from their ecosystem to play their games on PC, it draws confusion from players. That’s especially true when games are single-player-only titles such as Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok.</p>







<p>For comparison, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut, which launched on PC on May 16, doesn’t require a PSN account to play the single-player mode. It’s only needed if you want to play the game’s Legends multiplayer mode.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think of needing a PSN account to play God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn on PC? What about the idea of needing console accounts, in general, to play certain games on PC?</p>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> developer Rockstar Games' decision to not announce the game for PC. Currently, GTA 6 is scheduled to launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in Fall 2025, and Zelnick was asked during a recent conference if an announcement regarding a PC launch would be made in the future.</p><p>"Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone," Zelnick said at the TD Cowen conference this week (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>).

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA VI) Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>Historically, Rockstar has launched several of its games on console first before eventually bringing them to PC. There have been some exceptions to the rule--like Red Dead Redemption--but games like GTA 4, GTA 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 all eventually made their way onto PC over time. Zelnick also recently spoke about the possibility of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-release-coming-up-take-two-boss-talks-about-setting-game-prices/1100-6523568/" data-ref-id="1100-6523568">Take-Two charging more than $70 for GTA 6</a> when it launches, commenting that Take-Two is aiming to overdeliver on the value of the game.</p><p>Zelnick added that Take-Two is still confident of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-release-window/1100-6523562/" data-ref-id="1100-6523562">Fall 2025 launch for GTA 6</a>, but he added that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">GTA VI will likely be a success</a> whenever it releases due to the massive fan hype already behind it.</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/">why GTA 6 won't be available on PC at launch</a>, a former Rockstar developer said it simply comes down to a matter of priority at the studio. However, history suggests that Rockstar may eventually bring GTA 6 to PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-platforms-dont-include-pc-so-far-but-history-suggests-launch-coming-later/1100-6519704/">although it could be a long wait</a> for people hoping to play the game on that platform specifically.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-has-filed-to-trademark-deadlock/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As first spotted by Twitter/X user <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV/status/1796528675745042495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Tyler_McV</a>, Valve Corporation has now filed to trademark Deadlock <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98576335&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via USPTO</a>.</p>



<p>According to the USPTO status page, Valve only just filed for the Deadlock trademark on May 30, 2024. It is now live and pending, awaiting examination, which finally marks another step forward for the game.</p>



<p>It may give curious fans a better idea of the potential release window. Insider Gaming has supported a possible release for Deadlock is 2025. </p>



<p>All of the leaked footage online may also hint at the current state of Deadlock’s development. There has been a surprising volume of growing leaks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-leaks-valve-not-addressed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including over 100</a> in recent weeks. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming also reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/">on new rumors</a> and provided exclusive details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-all-characters-in-valves-deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the characters</a> coming to Deadlock. The characters will include magicians, robots, creatures, humans, and more. </p>



<p>Leaks suggest that Deadlock will be a hero-based, third-person shooter featuring 6v6 matches. There have also been comparisons to DOTA’s gameplay loop. Fortunately, further news may be coming soon, following the trademark.</p>



<p>It would make sense for Valve to reveal more after so much of the game has recently leaked online. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-deadlock-gameplay-appears-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new gameplay videos</a> surfaced, revealing quite a lot. Deadlock appears to be in its Alpha testing stage. It was previously known as Neon Prime.</p>



<p>At this time, Valve has not officially announced anything about Deadlock or its trademark.</p>

<p>As one of the most important games ever released, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas had a soundtrack fit for the title of the greatest game of all time. Such a title is reserved for a few games in the history of all consoles; it’s also objective and can cause a flurry of emotional opinions at the mere suggestion that another game should deserve this moniker over your favorite title.</p>



<p>In any event, even if you’re not a fan of Grand Theft Auto games, you can’t deny the huge cultural impact that each game has had from GTA 3 onwards. Part of this immense appeal has been because of the number of iconic songs that have appeared in the games over the years.</p>



<p>Back in 2004, San Andreas was by far the most ambitious that Rockstar had ever undertaken. It boasted three islands, including Las Venturas, where you could play a whole casino floor of games, which was a huge leap from Vice City. In San Andreas, you can play at a number of roulette tables across several different casinos on the Venturas Strip. Rockstar expanded this idea to incorporate the style of <a href="https://www.slots.lv/casino/table-games/roulette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roulette</a> games you see online today, with their GTA V model their most successful and ambitious yet.</p>



<p>A lot of the casino music in San Andreas is synonymous with the game. While James Brown was a tough omission from today’s list, the saxophone from his iconic track is something many of us attach to those roulette games on those old, nostalgic casino floors of San Andreas.</p>



<p>San Andreas was seen as a monster of an upgrade from Vice City, which was a phenomenal game in itself. A big part of this was the extensive catalog of radio stations and songs – more than double that of its predecessor, Vice City. You could easily make a top 15 or 20 GTA song, but we’ve been tasked with the unenviable task of boiling it down to the top five.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-ice-cube-it-was-a-good-day">5 – Ice Cube – It Was A Good Day</h2>



<p>Cruising around Los Santos in the low-rider golden days. Few songs could match the summer vibe of Los Santos like Ice Cube’s classic song. It was a staple of Radio Los Santos and those early Grove Street missions. The famous sample is one of the most iconic in the history of rap – and it remains a song that is synonymous with the era, rap music, and the G-funk era that defined the West Coast in the early 1990s.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-rage-against-the-machine-killing-in-the-name">4 – Rage Against The Machine – Killing In The Name</h2>



<p>As one of the biggest bands of the early 1990s and hailing from the West Coast of the US, Rage was an almost guaranteed inclusion in the San Andreas soundtrack. Their song gained traction again just a few years after the release of San Andreas when they got to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rage-against-the-machine-take-christmas-no-1-slot-1846247.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Christmas number one in the UK</a>.</p>



<p>It’s such a huge part of the game that its omission of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/nov/17/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review-an-infuriating-disappointment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">widely criticized re-releases</a> was noticeable and attracted negative attention on social media. It doesn’t take away from the fact that Rage was such a big part of the game and introduced a new legion of fans to their music via this landmark Rockstar classic.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-dr-dre-amp-snoop-dogg-nuthin-but-a-g-thang">3 – Dr Dre &amp; Snoop Dogg – Nuthin’ But A “G” Thang</h2>



<p>Everything we said about Ice Cube applies to Nuthin’ But A G Thang – from the immortal Dre album The Chronic – for some, this is the quintessential San Andreas track. It exemplifies driving around Los Santos and many of those early missions when we were first getting to explore what the most anticipated game ever released had in store for us.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-lynyrd-skynyrd-free-bird">2 – Lynyrd Skynyrd – Free Bird</h2>



<p>We’re not sure about you – but if you were cruising over Mount Chiliad in a private jet, Free Bird seemed to be the song that would crop up often. Many consider Free Bird to be the greatest ever Lynyrd Skynyrd track, and it’s definitely their most recognizable. Free Bird introduced a whole new wave of fans to the iconic rock band – and it’s definitely one of the most nostalgic for those of us who still have fond memories of playing San Andreas all those years ago.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-guns-n-roses-welcome-to-the-jungle">1 – Guns N Roses – Welcome To The Jungle</h2>



<p>We’ve put Welcome To The Jungle at number one because it was a song in the first-ever TV trailer. For those of you who can still cast your minds back that far, the excitement was truly palpable. The trailer focused on all of the new advancements: the Venturas strip, private jets, bicycles, helicopters, parachutes, and a whole raft of other innovations.</p>



<p>This Guns N Roses classic is one that many of us still attached to the main protagonist, CJ – who we rank as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-protagonists-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number 2 GTA protagonist of all time</a>. While there might be more iconic individual GTA songs – Welcome To The Jungle perfectly encapsulated the game, and the era the game was set. Simpler times for many of us, I’m sure!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They will make more announcements in due time."</h2></div><section><p>Is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> coming to PC after console? PC gamers have assumed it would ever since Rockstar unveiled perhaps the most-wanted video game on earth for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only. Now, the boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two has issued a vaguely-worded statement that, if you read in between the lines of the corporate doublespeak, suggest that yes, GTA 6 will eventually come to PC.</p><p>During an interview at a TD Cowen conference this week, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick responded to a question about whether Rockstar’s lack of a PC announcement was set in stone, or if a PC version would be announced later.</p><p>Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><p>Zelnick dances around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he does point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude, only to have those hopes dashed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Grand Theft Auto 6 vs Real Life Inspiration</h3></div></output><p>Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>In December, a former developer at Rockstar <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s">attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p>The first official GTA 6 trailer is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-has-already-surpassed-grand-theft-auto-5s-reveal-with-more-than-100-million-views"><u>the most-viewed video game reveal on YouTube within 24 hours</u></a>. Set in modern-day Leonida, a fictionalized version of Florida, GTA 6 will let players control Lucia and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-protagonist-isnt-played-by-the-last-of-us-star-troy-baker"><u>an unnamed male</u></a> that some fans speculate is named Jason.</p><p>Questions have swirled around GTA 6's release date ever since the initial reveal, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-website-changes-hinting-at-new-screenshots-has-fans-going-feral"><u>fans going feral over details like website updates</u></a>. Internal conflicts over Rockstar's return to office policy has led to questions over whether <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns"><u>GTA 6 will ultimately be delayed into 2026</u></a>. However, as of right now, it looks like Take-Two and Rockstar are determined to get GTA 6 out the door during its intended release window.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

This message is reiterated on the Steam page for both games. Unfortunately, this means God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn are unavailable on Steam in regions in which PSN is not live.</p><p>While it has now become clear that all Sony’s PC games will require a PSN account to play after the Helldivers 2 debacle in April and, more recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-escapes-psn-account-requirement-but-ghost-of-tsushima-multiplayer-does-not">a furore over the PSN requirement for the multiplayer portion of Ghost of Tsushima</a>, some had hoped single-player only games would be spared. Not so.</p><p>PSN is available in just 69 countries, leaving many out in the cold. The Baltics, including states that are part of the European Union (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), are also excluded. For years, some players in these countries have created a PSN in a supported region to get around the restrictions, but there are concerns that Sony could ban the accounts of those who do. Exacerbating the backlash is that Sony has doubled down on this policy even for single-player games, such as God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationEU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PlayStationEU</a> <a href="https://t.co/zFQ6GMUzVG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zFQ6GMUzVG</a> <a href="https://t.co/0NpiM5PTlv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0NpiM5PTlv</a></p>— Pavel Djundik (@thexpaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1796433659370848555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is very odd.

When it announced the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2, it said it had to do with player security. “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games,” Sony said in a statement issued at the time. “This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.”</p><p>Perhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony said: “We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of. “Many thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!”</p><p>Sony’s only other statement on the matter was issued when it backtracked for Helldivers 2: “Helldivers fans -- we’ve heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update. The May 6 update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30, will not be moving forward.</p><p>“We’re still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable. Thanks again for your continued support of Helldivers 2 and we’ll keep you updated on future plans.”</p><p>The PC version of Ghost of Tsushima was the first PlayStation PC port from PlayStation Studios to use the new PlayStation Overlay. This UI, which you can see in the image below, lets users access their PlayStation profile, including their Friends List and Trophies.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/pc-sony-1715082750026-1717155848231.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This week, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s newly appointed co-CEO Hermen Hulst indicated Sony’s strategy is to entice PC gamers into buying a PlayStation 5 using console-exclusive sequels.</p><p>"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said during Sony's Business Segment Meeting 2024. While live service games such as Helldivers 2 and Concord will launch on PC at the same time as PS5, “tentpole titles”, such as triple-A single-player games, will continue to see a staggered release on PC.</p><p>"We're finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing sequels on the PlayStation platform," Hulst added. "We have high hopes that we're actually able to bring new players into PlayStation at large but into PlayStation platforms specifically - actually, the same goals for the work that we do with extending our great properties onto other media such as television series and film, for example, as you have seen with the Last of Us on HBO or Gran Turismo the film."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>The New York Times accused the game of being "nearly identical in appearance, sound, and meaning"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The owner of Wordle has filed a lawsuit against Worldle, a puzzle game that focuses on guessing geographical places rather than words.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o">BBC News</a>, the New York Times said the geography-based app is "nearly identical in appearance, sound, meaning, and imparts the same commercial impression" as Wordle. It also accused the game of "creating confusion" among users.</p>
<p>Worldle is a browser-based game run by Seattle-based developer Kory McDonald, with an estimated average of 100,000 monthly players.</p>
<p>"There's a whole industry of [dot]LE games," McDonald said. "Wordle is about words, Worldle is about the world, Flaggle is about flags."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-york-times-acquires-wordle">Wordle was acquired by the New York Times in 2022</a> from its creator, Josh Wardle.</p>
<p>In March this year, the newspaper issued DMCA takedown notices to developers of games similar to Wordle to "defend its intellectual property rights," as reported by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nyt-copyright-takedown-wordle-clones-new-york-times/">CBS</a>.</p>

The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, "As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."</p>



<p>Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/until-dawn-arrives-on-ps5-and-pc-this-fall">which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon</a>) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.</p>

            <p>Destiny 2 will go offline for 25 hours ahead of the launch of its final expansion, The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The downtime – which is scheduled to kick off at 5pm UK time on 3rd June (that's 9am PT, 12pm ET) and end at 7pm on 4th June – is required to prep for the new expansion, which is estimated to take up at least 129GB of free space on every platform, and almost 300GB on Steam.</p>

<p>As detailed in the latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-30-24">This Week in Destiny update</a>, players can pre-download update 8.0.0.2 from 6pm UK time (10am PT, 1pm ET) on 1st June on PS3, while PC and Xbox players have to wait until the same time on 3rd June.</p>
<p>The storage requirements are brutal, though. For a PS5, you'll need 144GB free, and 130GB on PS4. Xbox Series X/S players need a hefty 165GB free, whilst Xbox One players 139GB.</p>
<p>It's PC players that really take the brunt of the huge download sizes, though; the Microsoft Store's version requires 156GB, whilst Epic Games Store and Steam require you to have 280GB and 300GB of free space, respectively – or more, depending upon what language you have installed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the install size will shrink down once everything's installed (the Steam and EGS install size will take up a more modest 155GB and 144GB respectively), but it remains a significant portion of your console's HDD, especially if you play on last-gen systems or the 500GB Xbox Series S, as Destiny 2 will take up a full third of your HDD.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/huge-destiny-2-the-final-shape-spoilers-leak-online-as-players-get-accidental-early-access">The Final Shape DLC has leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available</a> on PS5 yesterday. Developer Bungie "killed" the servers, but this was not before spoilers about the story, raid, trophies, loot, and more – much, <em>much</em> more – swamped social media.</p>
<p>Bungie later acknowledged spoilers were shared online, and that a "small group of players" were able to access the campaign, Collections, Echoes, and "other reward info". It advised players who don't want the experience spoiled to "be very careful" on social media in the lead up to The Final Shape's release next week, and asked those who have seen the spoilers to "please be considerate of others".</p>

            <p>The highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is set to release next year across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>. However, Rockstar is yet to say anything at all regarding a PC release.</p>
<p>Now,  publisher Take-Two has given further comment on the lack of Grand Theft Auto 6-related PC news, stating Rockstar would "make more announcements in due time".</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582">interview</a> at a TD Cowen conference (as transcribed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/">VGC</a>), Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said "the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn't seem to me that either would be set in stone". </p>

</figure>
<p>Zelnick continued to state developer Rockstar has "an approach to platforms which we've seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time". The Take-Two head believes the right approach for the business is to "be where the consumer is", adding: "Historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time."</p>
<p>While surely disappointing for many PC owners out there, Rockstar has previously released its games on console first, so this current lack of news is perhaps not surprising. After all, GTA 6's predecessor - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">seemingly evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5</a> - initially released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, before eventually being made available on Windows in 2015.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow Rockstar stalwart Red Dead Redemption is still to arrive on PC, even 14 years down the line. This particular title initially launched for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010, and for a long time the only way to play it on a modern console was via Xbox backward compatibility. That changed recently when Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">ported the game over to Switch and PlayStation</a>, but a PC release still remains noticeably absent.</p>
<p>As for GTA 6's console debut, Take-Two recently stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">"highly confident" it will make that autumn 2025 release window</a>. While Zelnick said there is often "slippage" in the industry, and Take-Two is not immune from delays, he does not see this happening with GTA 6.</p>
<p>"We narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing," Zelnick said earlier this month.</p>

<p>You might have seen the recent announcement from PlayStation State of Play regarding the PC launch of God of War Ragnarok. We all knew it was coming. Following the immense success of the previous title on Steam, it was only a matter of time before Sony got wise. But there’s a caveat. Does God of War Ragnarok require a PSN account?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-psn-to-play-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">Do You Need PSN to Play God of War Ragnarok on PC?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, to play God of War Ragnarok on PC, you need a PSN account and login. This is extremely unfortunate, considering there are only approximately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-countries-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">70 countries with PSN support</a>. There are significantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more without PSN support</a>, well over 120, that simply won’t be able to purchase or play the game on Steam. </p>



<p>Sony is shunning its countless fans across the world, preventing them from enjoying what is often considered one of the most cinematic action adventures in gaming today. We’re hoping they turn this decision around, but it’s unlikely. Many countries still can’t buy or play Helldivers 2, even despite<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-positive-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the massive turnout by the community</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-god-of-war-ragnarok-multiplayer-or-single-player">Is God of War Ragnarok Multiplayer or Single-Player?</h2>



<p>Despite the always-online requirements and PSN, God of War Ragnarok isn’t a multiplayer game. It doesn’t have a cooperative game mode, leaderboards, or competitive PvP in any way, shape, or form. It’s a totally single-player adventure.</p>



<p>Sony continues to push its PSN requirements on PC players primarily because it wants to bring everyone into its ecosystem. In God of War Ragnarok, PSN is “necessary” because of trophies and PlayStation Overlay.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re certainly not thrilled about the PSN requirements in the action-adventure, but there are plenty more upcoming games to see this summer. Don’t miss a single one by signing up for the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, the official Little Nightmares 3 account confirmed the game is now delayed to 2025.</p>



<p>The message to fans is a little vague about the cause for delay. But it does explain that “quality is a top priority for us,” and that the devs want to “give the game the care and love it deserves.”</p>



<p>The team did not confirm if the game would be moved to early or late 2025. However, they do reassure fans that more news about Little Nightmares 3 is coming “later this summer.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Supermassive Games announced its anticipated horror sequel Little Nightmares 3 last year at Gamescom. The devs originally planned to release it in 2024 before it was delayed today. </p>



<p>If it aimed to release around Halloween, that might imply the 2025 launch could be earlier than later, but that’s only speculation. The two previous games both released earlier in their launch year, in April 2017 and February 2021.</p>



<p>Supermassive Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/supermassive-games-to-lay-off-up-to-30-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also faced layoffs</a> last February that affected up to 30% of its staff. It’s unclear if this in particular delayed Little Nightmares 3.</p>



<p>Supermassive previously developed Until Dawn, which released in 2015. It just appeared during Sony’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> this week. A remaster of Until Dawn is officially coming to PC and PlayStation 5 in fall 2024. It now has a new gameplay trailer showcasing its updated visuals.</p>

        <p>A focus on live games is likely to set the tone for other events over the next weeks – while a lack of major announcements for 2025 could leave a rare open goal for Xbox</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The start of June in the games business feels increasingly like one of those archaeological sites where nothing remains of the original structure, but researchers can piece its shape together from the gaps it has left behind.</p>
<p>E3 is gone, but we are left with all the various events and showcases that grew up around the show through its various incarnations and endless identity crises – and so, for the next two weeks, we'll be treated to a trade show's worth of announcements and updates on upcoming games, just without the trade show that was once sat in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>Even without E3 itself, it remains arguably the best time of year to take the industry's temperature and to gain an understanding of where we're headed in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">Sony kicked off the Not-E3 season with a State of Play presentation</a> showcasing upcoming PS5, PSVR2, and PC games on the company's slate. It's fitting that Sony should go first, establishing the bar that others need to try to exceed; this year has cemented the PS5's market leadership in a big way, after all.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Sony had nothing to prove, though. There's a sense of disquiet evident in a lot of the conversations and commentary around PlayStation this year.</p>
<p>After turning out a reliable stream of major hits for years, 2023 is a strangely fallow period for the company's release schedule, and while the unexpected breakout success of Helldivers 2 has given it a reprieve from accusations of an empty year, it hasn't helped alleviate suspicions that Sony's new fascination with live-service games has been to the detriment of its ability to focus on the high-quality single-player titles upon which it built its first-party reputation.</p>
<p>If you're in the camp that fears that Sony is outright pivoting to live service, the State of Play presentation this week will have done nothing to allay your concerns. Almost a third of the running time of the event was given over to Concord, a live-service PVP hero shooter developed by Firewalk Studios, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-to-acquire-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">new team founded by Bungie veterans which Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>The game looks fine – it may well be extremely good, and there's probably a place in the market right now for a competently-run and lightly-monetised game in the mould of Overwatch – but as the primary focus for a presentation in which Sony laid out its stall for the rest of this year and well into 2025, this will set alarm bells ringing for a lot of core consumers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing to really watch out for is publishers announcing live-service sequels or spin-offs to formerly single-player series</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such concerns over Sony's focus in the coming years will not be allayed very much by three more live service type games being included in the presentation – Marvel Rivals (another hero shooter), Infinity Nikki (seemingly a gacha MMO title), and Ballad of Antara (clearly inspired by Elden Ring, but set to be an F2P title of some kind).</p>
<p>Whether you think such concerns are valid, of course, is entirely subjective; it is undeniable that the industry has ended up backed into an economic corner to some extent due to rising development costs and a stubbornly non-growing audience, with successful live service games being one of the seemingly few paths out of this dead end. The counterpoint is that "successful" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence, with the past couple of years seeing many high-profile live service titles collapsing soon after launch.</p>
<p>Even attaching expensively licensed IP doesn't guarantee any sort of return, as Square Enix and Warner Bros' misadventures with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-to-end-support-on-marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wbs-push-for-predictable-returns-carries-real-risk-this-week-in-business">DC's Suicide Squad</a> respectively have painfully demonstrated.</p>
<p>The immense risks attached to launching live service games, though, don't change the fact that the economics of big-budget single-player titles have never been worse – and few developers have been able to thread the needle of creating lower-budget titles that consumers still find appealing.</p>
<p>Sony's strong focus on live-service games is, therefore, likely to be replicated quite extensively in the various publisher and platform holder showcases we're due to see in the next fortnight. This trend isn't going to slow down despite recent failures in the space. Until someone comes up with a better solution to this economic conundrum, everyone is going to keep chasing those Fortnite dollars.</p>
<p>The thing to really watch out for is not so much attempts to introduce new live-service IP like Concord, but publishers announcing live-service sequels or spin-offs to formerly single-player (or traditional multiplayer) series.</p>
<p>That's where fur and feathers will really start to fly – in Sony's case, at least, there's a background understanding that while the company may be pivoting to live service in some regards, its major studios like Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Insomniac, and Sucker Punch are all simply caught on the hop this year, with their undoubtedly immense AAA projects simply not quite ready to be shown in public.</p>
<p>Other publishers, however, are likely to go further than Sony, moving existing franchises and studios entirely over into live service, with all the attendant brand risks that entails.</p>
<p>Live service games were not, however, the only trend visible in Sony's State of Play. One interesting thing to note is that the company is continuing to work on building out partnerships with developers and publishers around Asia (outside Japan), with several of the games chosen for this showcase coming from Chinese developers in particular.</p>
<p>This is a strategy that has worked out quite well for Sony thus far – it gave the PlayStation console exclusivity for the Chinese-developed Genshin Impact, which is one of the most successful and profitable games of the past decade, and more recently saw Sony publishing Korean-developed Stellar Blade, which has done very well and (along with Helldivers 2) helped to rescue an otherwise quiet first half of the year for the PS5.</p>
<p>Broadening and deepening partnerships with companies in China and South Korea – which are not traditionally major regions for console development, but which have tons of talent and experience in mobile and PC gaming – is clearly a priority for Sony, and may give it an edge over competitors even at a time when its own internal first-party pipeline is stuttering a bit.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Helldivers 2's success] hasn't helped alleviate suspicions that Sony's new fascination with live gamess has been to the detriment of its focus on the single-player titles upon which it built its first-party reputation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast, Microsoft – whose Xbox showcase will come in a little over a week's time – has now absorbed the lion's share of $100bn worth of game studios and publishers, and will presumably be hoping to find its own competitive edge in the enormous studio system it now owns.</p>
<p>This has been repeated <em>ad nauseum</em>, but it remains true: Microsoft has a lot more to prove in its summer showcase events than its rival, not only due to lagging in console sales but also due to the very negative press generated by its recent studio closures and layoffs.</p>
<p>It needs to regain momentum, and to show that it is doing exciting things with the massive library of IP and network of studios it has acquired. While Sony's State of Play wasn't bad, per se, it didn't exactly set out a strong manifesto for PlayStation in the coming year – scanning responses online suggests that I'm far from alone in finding the utterly charming Astro Bot to be by far the most exciting thing in the presentation, but I don't think anyone is expecting that to be the next God of War or Spider-Man in mass-market appeal terms.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Astro-Bot.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>While Astro Bot's charm and appeal are undeniable, it's unlikely to be the next God of War or Spider-Man in terms of mass-market appeal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Microsoft could do a great deal to reset its recent negative narratives simply by showing a solid sequence of trailers for major franchises (or new IPs from major studios) with 2025 or even 2026 projected dates, giving Xbox an edge over PlayStation in consumer perception of the game pipeline for the first time in many years.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the relatively muted tone that Sony has set for the start of this odd, E3-less announcement season is likely to be more the rule than the exception. Just as high-profile live service failures have not deterred Sony, expect other publishers to charge ahead in this sector, some even more aggressively; and just as Sony's software pipeline appears to have hit some road bumps, expect to see other publishers also coming up a little empty in their announcements for 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>You can't lay off as many people as the industry has in the past 18 months, coming off the back of the immense disruption of the pandemic era, and expect to keep pumping out high-budget hits. The events of the next couple of weeks may well be our first real glimpse at how much this loss of development capacity is going to inflict commercial pain in the next couple of years.</p>

		<p> Another Friday rolls around, and it’s been a week that’s once again full of gaming goodness. I’ve continued to dabble in Overwatch 2, though I’ve seemingly got worse at it this week. I’ve also been playing Hellblade 2, EA F1 24, and the lovely fantastical city builder Fabledom. My son thinks I like it because it has my name in it. That’s not entirely true, but it might help.</p>

<p>It is the second week in a row that we’re announcing TSA nuptials, and this time we’re wishing all the best to our Editor in Chief, Teflon, as he’s all set to get married tomorrow! It’s a wedding bonanza around here!</p>
<p>Gamoc has played Diablo IV Season 4, Fallout 4, Stranded: Alien Dawn, and Fallout New Vegas, saying, “The latter is a challenge, every fight has me dipping into my inventory.”</p>
<p>Following his own wedding last week, Aran hasn’t played any games as he’s currently on a little honeymoon in Cornwall. I am sending him a review code for BLUD though, so I expect he’ll be playing that when he gets back!</p>

<p>Jason has been playing Wuthering Waves, which apparently has some potential as a slightly more combat-intensive open-world gacha game. He’s also been playing lots of D&amp;D, “the one true way to be a fool with friends.” </p>

<p>TC has been playing Destiny 2 in prep for The Final Shape. He also has more SixthAxis wedding action to announce as we offer congratulations to Andy and Steph from the TSA Destiny Clan who also got married last weekend! We love the amount of love in the (chat)room!</p>
<p>Jim takes things in a different direction by playing Death Stranding. He told us, “While somewhat soothing, I’m now wanting to forge ahead with the story instead of building every road and delivering every nugget of cargo I can see. In typical Kojima fashion, the story isn’t making any sense, though I’m quite happy for it to wash over me instead of feverishly flicking through the Death Stranding wiki for answers.”</p>
<p>That’s not the only thing from our Senior Editor, as he continues, “I’ve also played a few matches of XDefiant, Ubisoft’s Call of Duty rival that features a cast of crossover factions. It’s fast, fun, and has a good amount of depth thanks to the Overwatch-like ultimate abilities, weapon loadouts, and player progression. The lack of skill-based matchmaking has also been a nice novelty after years of back-to-back Call of Duty games where I’ve been seemingly thrown to the wolves straight out of the gate.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Steve has played the heck out of Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga, saying, “I’ve really enjoyed the audio-visual spectacle and the harrowing narrative but the gameplay hasn’t really evolved since the first one. I then moved on to the average but fun Immortals of Aveum, the failure of which is a shame as it sets up an interesting fantasy FPS world that will probably never be used again. Alongside these I got all the achievements in the cute as hell Little Kitty, Big City and have been playing the fantastic Lorelei and the Laser Eyes for review – this has taken a bit longer as my kids (12 and 17) are playing it with me.”</p>
<p>Finally, Ade has been playing Astor: Blade of the Monolith for review. You can read his words about it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/astor-blade-of-the-monolith-review/">right freak’n now</a>!</p>
<p>And what about you? Played anything good this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and developer Supermassive Games have announced that horror platformer sequel&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond 2024.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>will now launch at some point in 2025, although a more specific release window hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>The reason for the delay is the usual story; more time is needed to give the game the "care and love it deserves", and since "quality is a top priority" for Bandai Namco and Supermassive, the release window has been moved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-3-delayed-sandstorm.jpg?itok=4WUS3jRH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-3-delayed-sandstorm.jpg?itok=60CZZabf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>won't emerge from the sandstorm until next year.</figcaption></figure><p>All is not lost, though; Bandai Namco and Supermassive say that they'll share more information about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>"later this summer", so we may well get a new release window - or, at the very least, a new trailer - soon.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3</em>, it is, believe it or not, the third mainline game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series of cinematic platformer-style horror adventures.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-revealed-at-future-games-show">during Gamescom Opening Night Live last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>will be the first game in the series not to be developed by Swedish studio Tarsier, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-thq-nordic-has-bought-little-nightmares-developer">purchased by Embracer Group in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>The game will place an emphasis on co-operative gameplay; you'll either be able to tackle it with a friend in co-op or solo with an AI partner.</p>

<p><em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>is currently set to launch sometime in 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392860/Little_Nightmares_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10003713" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. We'll bring you more on this spooky-looking horror platformer, as well as all other things Bandai Namco, as soon as we get it.</p>

            <p>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/office-fight">Office Fight</a>, a stylish physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.</p>

<p>After customising your own dead-eyed employee, you’ll start your new job and be bombarded by emails, one of which is you getting fired. You drop dead at your desk, and the next thing you know, you’re chatting to a friendly ghost who welcomes you to undeath. Now, you can posses various objects in the office to cause chaos, like flinging desk chairs at people. Unrelated but does anyone remember those Casper The Friendly Ghost ice lollies? They were S-tier, and I must assume they haven’t existed for decades, although I haven’t gone looking. Casper-heads, feel free to chime in with pertinent info.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Anyway, you get a certain amount of possessions to cause as much chaos as possible. Maybe, if you fling that tower unit just right, you’ll cause a riot and the remaining employees will beat each other up! Maybe you could send a monitor flying into that vending machine? Who knows what might happen then? I bet it’ll be good though. Individual stages look to have lots of little tailor-made interactions that result in fun violence, like a Rube Goldberg machine where the ‘Goldberg’ is actually professional wrestler Goldberg. I’m not 100% sure I’d stick around for a whole game of this, but the free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747060/Office_Fight/">Steam demo</a> is definitely worth a spin. You can keep up with all our Steam Next Fest coverage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-24-review.886167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The 21st Century has seen the longest stretches of team domination in the history of Formula 1. The last 14 years has seen drivers from just two teams win the whole shebang. That’s year after year, for nearly a decade and a half. Yes, Formula 1 is foremost an engineering series, and the recipe for winning a World Drivers' Championship essentially begins with “have the quickest car” and ends with “be faster than your teammate.” Yes, there’s a glimmer of promise <em>this</em> year with four different winners in just eight Grands Prix.</p><p>However, broadly speaking, the predictability of F1 <em>is</em> getting a little old hat. Unfortunately, Codemasters’ F1 series is suffering a parallel predictability problem in F1 24, in that it’s a terrific racing game but, despite its well-executed new career mode and flattering handling model, it’s mostly an extremely familiar experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>F1 24’s new hook is the ability to “be one of the 20,” as Codemasters puts it. This means we can now take one of F1’s superstar drivers and play as them in a complete, multi-season career mode experience called Driver Career. It’s essentially an adjacent mode to My Team, the team owner-driver mode added in F1 2020 – which still exists, unchanged, in F1 24. Driver Career isn’t actually limited to the 20 current top F1 drivers – you can also select an F2 driver, create a custom driver, choose from a selection of past F1 legends, or race as Pastor Maldonado.</p><p>Driver Career is mostly distinct for what it prunes out: things like team finances, sponsorships, and second driver signing. That helps it focus strictly on the experience of a single driver rather than someone who also needs to sign all the invoices as team boss.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The battle to build your driver’s reputation within the sport and emerge ahead in key rivalries against peers is a compelling one.</p></div><p>So that’s actually a very welcome change, and all these Driver Career features are also available in the two-player career mode. The big picture view of My Team was engaging for a spell, but given that it’s been the same thing annually for several years now, streamlining it to focus a bit more makes sense. Driver Career is a different juggle, and the battle to build your driver’s reputation within the sport and emerge ahead in key rivalries against peers is a compelling one. Pumping up your driver’s various ratings is a satisfying slow burn. Adding new achievements to a real driver’s existing career stats is cute. And yeah, the ability to put Mark Webber back into an F1 car and personally take him to victory is the best dad catnip since Tom Cruise put himself back into an F-14.</p><p>Unfortunately, like Tom Cruise in that F-14 with no nosewheel, it just doesn’t all quite land impeccably.</p><h2>Secret Equation</h2><p>Most disappointing are the new mid-race objectives. In theory, they’re a brilliant idea to spice up the racing on track. Something to add some urgency or tension to certain phases of a race, a mini-mission could be a smart way to keep us motivated in the midst of the wider contest. But to pull that off they’d need some kind of situational awareness of the race we’re driving in, and as it is they’re generally just too arbitrary and random. Yes, if you’re driving a little sloppy, there’s merit in the race engineer encouraging you to stick to the track limits for a specified number of laps, and then rewarding you for doing so. But in practice, too often your objectives just seem to be pulled from a bucket like we’re playing F1 bingo. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>10 Terrific F1 Games Throughout the Ages</h3></div></output><p>It’s a little daft, for instance, for your race engineer to be wringing his hands about your fuel burn rate and asking you to back off and drive more efficiently when the HUD clearly indicates you have more than enough to complete the race and then pour the remainder over your manager like Gatorade to celebrate. And F1 24 seems to know its objectives are dumb because there was never any punishment for failing; I would just give it the finger and continue to push as hard as possible, the objective would be flunked, the race engineer would shrug it off, and I… would still finish the race with fuel to spare, <em>like I told you</em>. Overall, mid-race objectives just aren’t as tailored to what’s actually going on as they need to be in order to matter or make things more interesting.</p><p>Secret meetings are a bit wonky, also. I appreciate they’re designed to emulate the behind-closed-doors nature of surprise driver moves, but it’s a little confusing that turning down so-called secret offers from rival teams made my existing team at McLaren pleased – like Zak Brown was hiding behind the curtains all along.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>The Codemasters and EA F1 Series</h3><p>Since acquiring Codemasters in 2021, EA is once again in the business of publishing F1 games. Here are all the F1 games EA and Codemasters have brought us over the years.</p></div><p>One of the things I like is the voice bites from the real drivers (which are samples from real F1 radio chatter from past races) but their lines are a lot more limited than I’d hoped. So far, all I’ve really heard is short grabs after crossing the finish line, and dismay at some terminal crashes (which aren’t always looking great this year, with loose wheels consistently clipping through cars while flapping around on their tethers, or behaving in other weird ways). Each driver has a handful, and it’s neat to hear Daniel Ricciardo repeat his iconic "I never left" ultimatum from Monza 2021, or the moments of joy that have been repurposed for drivers like Logan Sargeant or Pierre Gasly. However, drivers are otherwise silent throughout races – they don't gripe, react, or acknowledge the radio at all – so it’s a little vanilla.</p><p>The one-size-fits-all commentary segments continue to be rather basic, also. It’d just be nice for the library of commentary to have some lines prepared for juicy championship scenarios. For instance, I entered the final race in my first season with Oscar Piastri a single point ahead of Max Verstappen: It was winner take all. All F1 24 had in the can for the occasion were some boilerplate remarks about how drivers who’d had a dud season can approach the last GP before the winter break. I understand Codemasters and their EA corporate overlords can’t be expected to be prepared for every single scenario that our actions will create throughout our F1 24 careers, especially if I decide to get weird with it, but a championship going down to the last race is pretty low-hanging fruit, surely?</p><p>F1 World <em>is</em> back from F1 23, but I’m no more enamoured by it. I just don’t care about clothes and cosmetics, and I’m not really motivated by game modes that feel more like jobs. F1 World is admittedly harmless if, like me, all you’ll ever do is dip in for quick custom solo races and leave, but there’s nothing about grinding away for car upgrades and Battle Pass tat that appeals to me over the conventional but authentic solo career modes. Multiplayer seems akin to F1 23, and public lobbies will invariably still be like trying to host an egg and spoon race in the middle of a rugby match. Leagues remain a private alternative for civilised groups of like-minded players to compete.</p><p>By the way, I should also add I was definitely lulled into a false sense of optimism by F1 24’s fabulous reveal trailer. There’s no rock here in F1 24 itself; just a spray of electronic music from an avalanche of artists I’ve never heard of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Smooth Operator</h2><p>So let’s get down to where the rubber meets the road. F1 23’s handling was a lot more stable than F1 22, and to its credit F1 24 is even more so. In the lead-up to F1 24’s release, Codemasters discussed a raft of changes that had been made to the handling model. On paper there were a lot, but the upshot of these changes are sticky, compliant cars that are surprisingly simple to tame and get great drive out of corners. I anticipate there’ll be resistance from some who argue that a less-punishing handling model is less realistic, but what I won’t do is pretend I have any meaningful insight into what an F1 car feels like at maximum attack. Yes, they hold the road like glue in F1 24. Considering that, at high speed, F1 cars essentially have the weight of half-a-dozen pianos pressing them down onto the asphalt, who am I to say that feeling of immense grip is not credible? At any rate, I like the handling in this video game. I feel quick and confident and can drive extremely aggressively. I feel like an F1 driver who knows what he’s doing, at least, and that is the entire point of this quote-unquote-simulation. Like F1 23, it’s especially impressive on a gamepad, even relative to a wheel, where it is a bit twitchier by default.</p><p>Also like previous F1 instalments, the AI speed remains highly tuneable. It shouldn’t be glossed over how important it is to the atmosphere of F1 racing to ensure the margin between you and the AI is super tight, regardless of your skill level, and it’s a great feeling once you do find that perfect spot on the difficulty slider. If all racing games could be finessed this way, the genre would be a lot better off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Whether this refreshed handling and the new Driver Career mode is enough to justify upgrading from F1 23, 22, 2021, and so on, however, is your call. There are other items of note that might tip the scale: There’s a spin-off of the new Driver Career called Challenge Career, which is a curated, episodic version with a pre-determined driver (Verstappen, for now). It’s played solo, but you’ll compete with others asynchronously for leaderboard placement. It’s currently only just started, but I doubt I’ll want to play both this and my existing Driver Career. I’d rather begin a second save as a driver I actually want to race as.</p><p>To finish on a high note, F1 24 <em>is</em> the best-looking F1 game to date and, unlike EA Sports WRC, it remains on Codemasters’ proprietary engine where performance is totally reliable. Year over year there have been noticeable improvements to the driver likenesses. Bottas’ luxurious mullet and moustache combo is lovingly rendered, solidifying the fan-favourite Finn as the most Australian-adjacent F1 driver amongst a grid that features 10% actual Australians. Coming in after that, Spa, Silverstone, Jeddah, and Lusail have received updates to bring them up to snuff with the current real-life circuits (though Circuit Paul Ricard hasn’t made the final cut, so F1 24 has 25 tracks to F1 23’s 26).</p><p>And no, there’s no Braking Point story mode this year. As a reminder, that’s only been appearing in every other F1 game since 2021, so the next chapter of that isn’t part of F1 24.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The next Epic Games Store freebie as part of the company's ongoing Mega Sale promotion will be Marvel's Midnight Suns. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-lultime-jeu-mystere-aaa-bientot-offert-sur-pc-51882">Dealabs</a>' always-reliable billbil-kun, who notes the game will be available to download next week from Thursday 6th until Thursday 13th June.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to give it a go, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a brilliant character-centric role-player with Firaxis' trademark turn-based combat. Actions are made by cards, yes, but don't worry too much about that. It's fun, it's well-written, and being able to build up a secret base full of interesting Marvel superheroes is a blast.

<p>
However, launched right at the tail end of 2022 to lacklustre marketing, Marvel's Midnight Suns failed to find an audience - and any plans for a follow-up quickly evaporated.

</p>
<p>
The current Epic Games Store freebie is Chivalry 2, which yesterday replaced Farming Simulator 22. This current round of promotions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisition-free-on-epic-games-store-as-mega-sale-2024-begins">kicked off with Dragon Age Inquisition</a> - a strong choice ahead of us hopefully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-two-unannounced-games-to-launch-this-year-one-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf">seeing more of the upcoming Dragon Age Dreadwolf very soon</a>.

            <p>If you cast your minds back to March, you may recall the story about some missing Playdate consoles. During a talk at GDC, company co-founder Cabel Sasser revealed pallets containing $400k worth of Panic's palm-sized, crank-operated console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">gone AWOL in Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, Sasser called the whole situation "a bit of a true crime drama".</p>
<p>However, fast forward a couple of months, and the consoles have now been returned to their rightful owner, although the circumstances still seem rather bizarre.</p>

<p>Sharing an update on social media platform X, Playdate said its hardware "got hastily dumped at a random restaurant this morning".</p>
<p>In a subsequent post, the Playdate team said it will share more details about the whole ordeal further down the line. It noted having the consoles returned was the "best possible outcome", adding this resolution was the result of "lots of time and detective work" - something the team enjoyed.</p>
<p>"The real question is, can we sell these as a limited edition? Playdate HotTM," the team jokingly closed.</p> <div>

<p>Our Donlan reviewed the Playdate console back in 2022, calling it "a fascinating puzzle in itself".</p>
<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he mused in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>"Games straight from someone's attic workspace or the desk in the bedroom. Games straight from their weird head and their weird perspective and their weird take on what games should be. At its best Playdate gives you this - along with the nicely handled Zeldas and the Breakouts and the things it seems to feel it should give you to be well-rounded.</p>
<p>"Now I've seen it, I want more of it."</p>

            <p>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> community. In a <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1796240162185224240">video entitled</a> ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game's Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of '[naughty word SEO doesn't like being in the first paragraph] talk', you aren't welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.</p>

<p>“Player behaviour is a complex problem-space,” Donlon said. Sometimes solutions have to be “painfully manual. Sometimes tech - that has the potential to be a gamechanger - takes longer than you want”. She reiterated that offending community members are in the minority, but added that “unfortunately, there are still people in this world that want to take their insecurity, or their bad day, or their hate, or their whatever, on some stranger through their computer screen.”</p>
<p>“In almost all cases, someone gets hurt in the process of making these systems better,” continued Donlon. Earlier this month, streamer Taylor Morgan went viral with the below post</p>

<p>In the attached video, Morgan shared footage from a stream in which she was subject to sexual harassment and verbal abuse from another player. “I know you hear us,” Morgan wrote. “I know you see us. If this goes unpunished I am taking this as an active act from you that you do not give a single fuck about any of the women and minorities that play your game, and I will rally to boycott.”</p>
<p>It would seem that Riot were paying attention. “When you to tell someone to ‘just mute comms’ to avoid harassment, you are essentially putting the harassed person in a position to not communicate,” said Donlon. “To compromise how they want to play the game to accommodate you.”</p>
<p>“Competitive games need to have room for banter. We believe this, and I do understand the fear that we will sanitise gaming by ‘over-addressing’ these issues,” Donlon continued. “We have no interest in doing that. But we do believe that a person should not have to be in a position to ‘grow a thicker skin’ or whatever other unhelpful suggestions have been thrown out there just to avoid threats of violence or literal hate-speech.” Talk is cheap, of course, but it’s heartening to see a studio so quickly react to something that’s making Valorant a worse place for so many. Riot themselves were the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-pay-100-million-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">allegations and lawsuits related to an abusive workplace culture</a> a few years ago, and have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-outline-five-year-strategy-including-plans-for-more-tv-movies-and-music">careful to position themselves as having learned from the experience.</a></p>

			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support, and several gameplay tweaks and fixes.</p>
<p>The May 31st patch finally brings DLSS 3 Frame Generation support for improved performance on NVIDIA RTX 4000 series graphics cards. The game received unofficial support with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlss-3-mod-released-for-free-by-puredark-native-implementation-is-there-just-hidden/">a mod</a> shortly after release, but the official implementation should be better, addressing some of the issues seen in the modded implementation, including stability issues.</p>
<p>The new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch also fixes a visual issue that prevented terrain from being displayed correctly on certain graphics cards, increases item storage space from 1000 to 3000, and fixes some other issues regarding Pawns' cosmetics and dialogues. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2054970/view/4174353069101968796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely a step forward from its predecessor when it comes to world design and visuals, but it leaves something to be desired regarding a lot of other elements, such as narrative, AI, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-performance-issues-lod-range/">performance</a>. Still, it is most definitely a game worth playing for all fans of the series, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
