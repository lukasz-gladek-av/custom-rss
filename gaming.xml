<p dir="ltr">The Initiative was formed in 2018 and based in Santa Monica. Billed as a "AAAA" studio, it was led by former Crystal Dynamics studio head Darrel Gallagher and made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-studio-the-initiative-adds-alumni-from-re/1100-6469070/" data-ref-id="1100-6469070">developers from Respawn, BioWare, Naughty Dog, and more</a>. In 2021, The Initiative announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-being-co-developed-by-tomb-raider-dev-crystal-dynamics/1100-6496517/" data-ref-id="1100-6496517">partner with Crystal Dynamics</a>, developer of the most recent Tomb Raider games, to assist on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p><p dir="ltr">Players got their first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">Perfect Dark gameplay</a> in 2024 as part of that year's Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer showed Perfect Dark to be a first-person shooter with immersive sim elements, as series protagonist Joanna Dark used gadgets, stealth, and melee takedowns to complete her objectives, all the while hinting at a greater conspiracy for players to uncover. Despite the gameplay showcase, Perfect Dark did not ever receive a release window.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by this new wave of layoffs at Microsoft. While at the time of writing The Initiative is the only studio closure announced, other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10 and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software have also seen layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty in an internal email shared by Windows Central confirmed Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>, and several other unannounced projects, one of which is reported to be ZeniMax Online's next MMORPG, have all been canceled as part of the layoffs.</p><p>"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty writes in the email. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>It's just the latest round of layoffs for Microsoft in recent years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft laid off an estimated 10,000 people</a>. Following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft laid off an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">estimated 1,900 employees in 2024</a>. That same year it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut down four Bethesda studios</a>, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands of workers across its various divisions in the latest cost-cutting measures taken by the corporation, whose 2024 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html">revenue exceeded $245 billion</a>, a 16-percent increase over its 2023 revenue. Though the cuts are impacted several of the company's various divisions, Xbox appears to be hit particularly hard. This represents the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-inbound-for-the-fourth-time-in-18-months">fourth time in 18 months</a> that Microsoft Gaming has laid off workers.</p><p>"We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," an Xbox spokesperson said in an official comment provided to <em>Game Informer</em>. Alongside the official statement, Xbox PR confirmed that less than 4 percent of Microsoft's global workforce was impacted. However, according to <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/">Microsoft's official reporting</a>, the company employs 228,000 people worldwide, which means 4 percent of the global workforce accounts for more than 9,100 people. Xbox PR also confirmed to <em>Game Informer </em>that the gaming division is impacted, "but not the majority," and stopped short of providing any additional details. When I requested a percentage of Xbox-specific impact, PR could not provide additional context.</p><p>However, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/"><em>Variety </em></a>and several other outlets obtained a memo to Xbox employees from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Notably, Spencer says, "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," and "Simply put, we would not be where we are without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted." You can see that in its entirety below.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams. &nbsp;</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil&nbsp;</p></div><p>Subsequently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"><em>The Verge</em></a> acquired a memo sent by Xbox president of game content and studios, Matt Booty. In his memo, Booty confirms Xbox is closing down The Initiative, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/new-microsoft-internal-studio-announced-undead-labs-ninja-theory-playground">an all-new first-party studio founded by Xbox in 2018</a> in Santa Monica, California. In 2020, The Initiative revealed it was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/the-initiatives-perfect-dark-announced">working on a new entry in the Perfect Dark franchise</a>, which is now canceled as a result of this closure. Booty also confirms the Twycross, England-based Rare, which Xbox acquired in 2002 and has worked on titles like Sea of Thieves and Viva Piñata, has been impacted by this round of layoffs, and its new IP, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/11/14/rare-works-its-whimsical-magic-in-the-new-world-of-everwild">Everwild</a>, which was announced in 2019, has also been canceled. You can read his full memo below.</p><div><p>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units.</p><p>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</p><p>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</p><p>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</p><p>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are.

            <p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is stepping away from his creative involvement in HBO's TV adaptation, calling this a "difficult decision".</p>
<p>In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">social media</a>, Druckmann said now season two of The Last of Us had wrapped, he would be moving his "complete focus" back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. This includes writing and directing the studio's all new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">as well as Naughty Dog's future projects</a>.</p>

<p>"Co-creating the show has been a career highlight," Druckmann said. "It's been an honour to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons."</p>
<p>Druckmann added he was "deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting" the first The Last of Us game, as well as the ongoing work adapting The Last of Us Part 2 for TV.</p>
<p>The statement noted now was the right time for the Naughty Dog head to step back from the show, before meaningful work on season three begins.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Last of Us season two aired earlier this year, picking up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season included Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>The showrunner additionally confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.</p>

<p>As for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, earlier this year the star of Naughty Dog's next game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann explained how Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet features a fictitious religion</a> which "becomes pretty prominent" in the game's alternate history.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="PowerA 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/413a1c80020e8/powera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Switch 1 before it, the Switch 2 will no doubt play host to dozens of third-party controllers over the course of its (hopefully) long lifespan. First out of the gate is PowerA with its Advantage Wired Controller, which I received in a rather jovial <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mario-time-nsgp0527-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mario Time</a> theme. You can also get a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mushroom-kingdom-nsgp0526-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mushroom Kingdom</a> themed variant along with a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0523-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">standard black design</a> – y’know, if you’re boring (joking!).</p>
<p>Boasting a similar layout to Nintendo's official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller</a>, the Advantage pad features offset analogue sticks, two mappable ‘AGL’ and ‘AGR’ buttons on the backside, and a handy headphone jack on the bottom. Really, the only major change in terms of layout is the placement of the start, select, home, GameChat, and capture buttons, which are all housed beneath the d-pad and right analogue stick.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7knoxgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To be honest, this alone was enough to throw me off my game; I’d often go to reach toward the centre of the pad to hit the home button, miss, and instead give the image of Mario a good ol’ fondle (Sorry, Mario) before realising the home button is actually down toward the bottom.</p>
<p>Having all of these buttons gathered together in one place <em>is</em> convenient in a way, and it does allow the artwork to really shine if you go for one of the themed variants, but it definitely plays havoc with about thirty years’ worth of muscle memory in which controllers at least housed the start and select buttons in the centre. Why fix what isn’t broken, y’know?</p>

<p>As for those mappable buttons on the back, these don’t function like the ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons on the Pro Controller. Well, they <em>do</em>, but you can’t assign inputs to them quite as easily. With Nintendo’s own offering, you can simply hold down the home button and assign inputs via the quick settings menu, but that isn’t available for PowerA’s controller.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to hold down the additional ‘PRGM’ button on the back until the LED light on the bottom turns dark blue. Then, you hit the button you want to remap and then assign it to either ‘AGL’ or ‘AGR’. It’s pretty manageable in practice and won’t take long to figure out after your first couple of goes, but it would’ve been nice if it supported quick remaps via the settings menu like the Pro Controller.</p>

<p>In terms of build quality, this is very much a budget controller, so it’s <em>incredibly</em> light at just 143g. For comparison, the Pro Controller is 235g, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">GameCube controller</a> is 210g, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">8bitdo’s Ultimate 2C Controller</a> is also 235g. Combined with the mandatory wired setup, the lightweight design makes lengthy gaming sessions an absolute breeze – no need to worry about discomfort or loss of battery life at all.</p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s… well, <em>too</em> <em>light</em>; to the point where it comes off as being pretty cheap. It feels like there’s barely anything inside the device, and you can tell by just tapping on the exterior with your finger: it sounds very hollow. This is exacerbated by the buttons, all of which give off very loud ‘clicks’ when pressed.</p>
<p>The worst of these are those aforementioned back buttons, which when pressed, sound like they’re reverberating throughout the interior of the controller.</p>

<p>Looking at the analogue sticks in a bit more detail, I don’t have a great deal to complain about here. They’re perfectly smooth and functional, with decent travel and good grip. Again, they sound pretty loud when hitting the casing on the outside, which you’ll definitely notice if you’ve been using the Switch 2's official Pro Controller, but otherwise, they’re good.</p>
<p>I can’t say the same for the d-pad, though. It’s slightly thicker and more rounded than Nintendo’s own offering, and it feels weirdly spongy when pressed. Needless to say, this makes more precise inputs a bit tricker on some retro games, and I wouldn’t even consider using it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="PowerA 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/093b52343e3e3/powera-10.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All in all, this isn’t a controller I’d recommend if you’re after a daily driver for the Switch 2. Your best options at the moment are Nintendo’s own Joy-Con 2 or Pro Controller. That said, if you’re after something cheap and cheerful for the player two in your life, this is a perfectly adequate option for you. Yes, it may feel a bit too light for some, the lack of rumble and motion control support is frustrating, and the wired setup sure isn't for everybody, but it’ll come in handy in a pinch if you’re looking for some local multiplayer fun.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Build or join a Guild to unlock a wide range of group activities—from intense guild wars to challenging multiplayer dungeons and epic raids. </em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>G/O Media has sold gaming site Kotaku to European company Keleops, which previously purchased Kotaku sister site Gizmodo in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/02/kotaku-sale-keleops-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axios</a> reports that the site's staff will stay on and that the new owner plans to make hires. The price of the deal was not disclosed.</p><p>In a press release sent to Aftermath, Keleops CEO Jean-Guillaume Kleis wrote, “We are thrilled to welcome the entire Kotaku team to Keleops." Kleis continued, “Kotaku isn’t just a brand—it’s a home for gamers and a place where the culture keeps moving forward. We are honored to shape its future."</p><p>Private equity firm Great Hill Partners (stay with me here) purchased Kotaku's parent company, then called Gizmodo Media Group, in <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/media/great-hill-partners-acquires-gizmodo-media-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019</a> from Univision. Univision <a href="https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/univision-gawker-sold-135-million-1201838638/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased it</a>, then called Gawker Media Group, in 2016 after the company <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/10/481565188/gawker-files-for-bankruptcy-it-faces-140-million-court-penalty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared bankruptcy</a> following a <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/15010575/hulk-hogan-wins-115-million-jury-gawker-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verdict</a> in a trial with wrestler Hulk Hogan.

Hernandez was reportedly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/go-media-fires-kotaku-editor-in-chief-patricia-hernandez" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired</a> in August of 2023. Subsequent EIC Jen Glennon resigned in March <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a> after leadership attempted to institute new rules emphasizing guides coverage, never Kotaku's focus area, over news. Kotaku saw <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> later that year.</p><p>The Root is now the only site in G/O's stable. IGN owner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/media/lifehacker-ziff-davis.html" target="_blank">Ziff Davis</a> bought Lifehacker in 2023. <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jezebel-acquired-paste-magazine-1235812182/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paste bought Jezebel</a>, following its closure and staff layoffs, in 2023, as well as <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/paste-magazine/paste-media-acquires-av-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The A/V Club</a> in 2024. Deadspin was sold to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/who-owns-deadspin-now-lineup-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling media company</a> in 2024, after its staff was also laid off (and well after its former staff <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775548069/after-days-of-resignations-the-last-of-the-deadspin-staff-have-quit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quit en masse</a> and formed <a href="https://defector.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a>). <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion</a> was sold in 2024 and is run by former NBC reporter Ben Collins.

Most recently, G/O sold <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/04/quartz-sold-redbrick-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quartz and commerce site The Inventory</a> in 2025.</p><p>While G/O still owns The Root, it also issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/business/media/kotaku-go-media-sale.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> suggesting it's winding down operations, with Spanfeller writing that "it became clear to our investors that it was time to move on." Spanfeller also couldn't resist taking a shot at the union, praising unions for "add[ing] value to editorial employees’ positions" while also writing that "the core methods that unions work with (or rather against) companies working hard to change with the times is counterproductive to both their membership as well as the companies as a whole.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully Kotaku employees do not care what Jim Spanfeller has to say, because he is no longer their boss! I am simply thrilled for Kotaku's staff and excited for their future; Gizmodo appears to be thriving, and I'm hopeful Kotaku will do the same. I'm looking forward to the site's talented journalists getting back to making a good outlet that people like without having to fight executives and private equity goons to do it.</p><p><em>This story has been updated</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july"><h3>Layoffs Begin At Xbox [Updating]</h3></a><p>Heavy cuts are expected in Microsoft's gaming division</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

The cuts to Turn 10 are reportedly very significant, with "nearly 50%" of staff affected, Schreier said.</p><p>Raven Software is the main co-developer on Activision's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> alongside Treyarch. Raven also works on Call of Duty: Warzone. Turn 10 Studios, meanwhile, is known for its work on the Forza Motorsport series, the latest entry of which came out in 2023 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>In addition to cutting staff, Microsoft has canceled Rare's Everwild and an unannounced MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios. The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Perfect Dark game has been canceled, too</a>, with its developer, The Initiative, closing up shop.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer claimed in a memo to staff that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">the cuts were necessary to propel Xbox forward to a healthy future.</a> "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," Spencer said in the wake of the cuts.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," he added. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox boss Matt Booty confirmed the cancellations of Perfect Dark and Everwild in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff seen by Windows Central</a>, while also saying "several unannounced games" are being axed as well. Booty also confirmed The Initiative is closing up shop, and that all of these initiatives took place to "adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p>Despite all of Microsoft's latest layoffs and game cancellations, Booty said Microsoft still has 40+ games in "active development" and a "strong slate" heading into 2026.</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years. After Microsoft closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">laid off around 1,900 people</a>.

<p>"You want to see something cool?"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of the cult 2015 movie <strong>Turbo Kid</strong>, rejoice! The upcoming Metroidvania sequel to the post-apocalyptic action movie is coming to Switch on 5th August 2025.</p>
<p>We first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> in February 2024, before it launched on Steam in April of that year. Now, the wait is over for Switch owners as you'll be able to pedal through the wasteland next month.</p>
<p>Developed by Outerminds, Turbo Kid takes place in a futuristic version of the '80s, where neon lights aren't necessarily a good thing. The world has crumbled; water is hard to come by and the wasteland is ruled by tyranny. So, what do you do? Grab your BMX and get biking.</p>
<p>Accompanied by gorgeous pixel art and a fantastic electronica soundtrack from Le Matos, even if you've never seen or heard of the movie, it's one to keep an eye on. Here's a rundown on what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedal. Slash. Explode. Repeat. -</strong> Rediscover the Metroidvania you should have grown up with. Blaze your trail through a mutant-infested wasteland, upgrade your arsenal of absurdly deadly weapons, and leave a trail of pixelated guts in your wake—all from the seat of your trusty BMX.</p>
<p><strong>BMX Combat -</strong> Who needs a horse when you have a bike with attitude? Call your BMX anytime to boost through maps, unlock shortcuts, smash enemies, or just pull sick tricks. It’s the first true Metroidvania where two wheels matter (no need to fact-check that).</p>
<p><strong>Slash, Shoot, Splat -</strong> Machetes? Of course. Turbo Glove™? Absolutely. From electric blasts to saw blades, your toolkit is overflowing with over-the-top destruction. Rip through enemies with style and turn every screen into a spray of beautifully deranged pixel gore.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to Explore, Freedom to Wreck -</strong> Set just after the events of the film, forge your path through a twisted world filled with bizarre characters and unexpected choices. Who you help—or hurt—will shape your journey across multiple playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>All Killer, No Filler -</strong> Love lore? It’s here. Hate it? Skip it. We built Turbo Kid with pure gameplay in mind: no unskippable cutscenes, no walls of text—just fast, fluid action and flexible storytelling that works whether you’re exploring or speedrunning.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-cancelled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down-as-part-of-microsoft%E2%80%99s-layoffs.1234302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a>, which has been corroborated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsypjg3yg22e">Bloomberg</a>, the latest casualty from Microsoft's massive 9,000+ employee layoff today is Xbox Game Studios team The Initiative, a team that was founded for the purpose of making a new Perfect Dark game. That Perfect Dark game is now cancelled, and The Initiative has been shuttered.</p>



<p>Windows Central had previously hinted towards this while reporting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG had been cancelled</a>, but has now confirmed the news after obtaining an email from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. Booty's memo also confirms what had already been reported around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild being cancelled</a>, and adds that "<em>several unannounced projects</em>" have also been cancelled as part of today's layoffs. </p>



<div><p>"<em>Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units</em>," Booty begins, referencing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">an email sent out from Microsoft Gaming chief executive officer, Phil Spencer</a>.</p><p>"<em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment</em>. <em>Our portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p><p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams. To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead</em>."</p></div>



<p>The cancellation of Perfect Dark also brings an end to the partnership Xbox had with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/">Crystal Dynamics,</a> who was working on the project alongside The Initiative.</p>



<p>Players who grew up with the first Xbox consoles recognize Perfect Dark as one of the series that helped make the Xbox a household name. While the last official Perfect Dark outing failed to impress, the excitement around its reboot could not have been higher for fans. The Initiative was described as a team of industry veterans, all excited to bring back the beloved stealth series. We even got to see some fairly impressive gameplay last year, seemingly indicating that the game was progressing well and that we'd see it on shelves within the next two years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, we'll never know what the final product would have looked like, as the failings of Microsoft's executive branch continue to devastate thousands of people across the video game industry.</p>



<p>While there have already been major cuts confirmed today, more are still inbound. Forza Motorsport studio, Turn10, has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> reportedly lost 50% of its staff,</a> and several Call of Duty studios, including Raven Software, have also suffered layoffs as part of today's cuts. We'll continue to update our stories and report on the cuts as more details are confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for Darrington Press' latest board game, <em>Solar Gardens</em>. The tabletop publishing arm of Critical Role's latest project is a strategic, tile-placement board game set in a solarpunk sci-fi city where building a garden helps build sustainable energy for the future.</p>

<h2>The <em>Solar Gardens</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, S<em>olar Gardens</em> is a tile-drafting board game that brings players into a utopian future. One where you transform city rooftops into verdant, sustainable gardenscapes with a combination of renewable energy and imaginative design.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-game-contents.jpg?itok=lKqG_uto 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-game-contents.jpg?itok=2pMuqiIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Solar Gardens</em> is designed for 2-5 players. A single game takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. Players take turns drafting and placing tiles on a map. Each tile represents greenery, solar panels, turbines, rainwater collectors, cultural hubs, and more. Players must strategically place these tiles to boost energy production, biodiversity, and aesthetic appeal, to create a living rooftop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Each playthrough of the game introduces new challenges. It encourages both competitive and casual players to experiment with different strategies in each game. If you want to play out the fantasy of building a beautiful future, or just want to beat your friends in landscaping, this game provides.</p>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> was designed by Eric Slauson (<em>MonsDrawsity</em>, <em>Kaiju Haiku</em>) and Alex Cutler (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skate-summer-gets-padded-up-for-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Skate Summer</em></a>, <em>A Place for All My Books</em>) and illustrated by Daniel Clarke. Echoing its overt environmentalist themes, the game is produced with biodegradable, plastic-free materials and will use paper stickers to hold its contents together in transit.</p>

<p>Lastly, each copy of the game sold will help fund reforestation in US national parks through the National Forest Foundation's Sapling Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solar Gardens is the latest tabletop game published by Darrington Press, joining a catalog of critically acclaimed, bestselling products including <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Queen By Midnight</a>, </em>the gaslamp fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, and the runaway fantasy TTRPG hit, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $44.99. It is set to release on July 31.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>

            <p>
Three former senior Ubisoft employees - including one-time chief creative officer and second-in-command Serge Hascoet - have received suspended prison sentences and fines from a French court after being found guilty of harassment prior to their departure five years ago.
</p>
<p>
Hascoet - along with Ubisoft's former editorial boss Tommy François and game director Guillaume Patrux - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ubisoft-execs-stand-trial-in-france-accused-of-harassment">appeared in a French court earlier this year</a>, accused of psychological and sexual harassment during their time at the company. All three left Ubisoft in 2020, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">wave of resignations and dismissals</a> among senior employees and executives, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">serious allegations of sexual misconduct become public</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">reported by the Guardian</a>, Francois has now received a three-year suspended prison sentence and a €30,000 fine after being found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment, and an attempted sexual assault. During the trial, it was alleged Francois had restrained a female employee while trying to kiss her on the mouth. He was also accused of forcing a female co-worker to do handstands while she wore a skirt, alongside other incidents.
</p>
<p>
Hascoët - who faced accusations of racist comments and other behaviour during the trial - was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment by the court, receiving an eight-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000. Patrux has been handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000 after being convicted of psychological harassment. During the trial, it was alleged Patrux had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, and set fire to a colleague's beard with a cigarette lighter, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">asked how much he knew of the issues taking place in his company</a> prior to the sexual misconduct allegations becoming public, Ubisoft CEO and co-founder Yves Guillemot said, "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will" in a carefully worded statement. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he added.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-technical-analysis-of-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-technical-analysis-of-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2.1234254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 2 arrived with a bunch of titles that had to perform well if they were going to be worth your time. Arguably, none were more in need of a silky smooth frame rate than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, which had to be top notch if it was ever going to appeal to the fighting fans.</p>
<p>We had a blast with the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> last month, with the performance in all modes (apart from World Tour) being a particular highlight. But for those who want the specific numbers, the experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6KBxxvdXo">Digital Foundry</a> have finally joined the fight to give a detailed rundown of all the tech specs in Capcom's latest.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with image quality, DF's Thomas Morgan states that the Switch 2 version "punches well above its weight". The Switch 2 puts up <strong>960x540p</strong> resolution in docked mode, with the DLSS upscaler boosting things to <strong>1080p</strong>. The analysis notes that you may encounter some flickers here and there, but it's a "win on balance" in the grand scheme of things, and even appears crisper than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Naturally, the image quality pales in comparison to the PS5's 4K offering, but the textures are a notable upgrade from the Series S and fall closer in line to what you'd find on the PS4.</p>
<p>Some settings are missing on Switch 2 — the depth of field effect, 'Crowded' background NPCs, no movement for physics-based particles — though DF emphasises that these are "never game-breaking".</p>
<p>The portable mode opts for a <strong>640x360p</strong> resolution, with DLSS reconstructing it up to <strong>720p</strong>, and lighting and shadows take a big hit because of it, winding up closer to the base PS4 edition. There's a docked/handheld comparison in the above video around the 8:20 mark that's well worth a look if you want to see the changes in action.</p>
<p>The World Tour modes are deemed "less polished in their visual delivery overall," with regular NPC pop-ins and reduced frame rates for characters at range. That said, DF is quick to point out that Switch 2 is "not alone in presenting these problems, rather, it inherits them from the other console releases".</p>
<p>In terms of frame rate, things are locked at a "perfect" <strong>60fps</strong> in both docked and handheld in the fighting rounds, but they do drop to around 45fps in the pre-fight hype sequences — not that it affects the game at all. The World Tour mode, as expected, is not as smooth, with the unlocked frame rate reaching anywhere from <strong>30-60fps</strong>, and getting capped at 30 in the side-on battles.</p>
<p>All in all, then, it sounds like a generally strong technical experience on Switch 2. You can see all of this analysis in action in the above Digital Foundry video, but for our thoughts on the game, you'll find our full review below.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The current custodians of the World of Darkness tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> universe are bang up for doing more video game adaptations like the troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, according to White Wolf brand marketing manager Jason Carl. In fact, they may be working on a few already, with Carl naming Mage: The Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming and the Dark Ages setting as deserving of "the Bloodlines treatment".</p>
<p>People who've been keeping up with the vamps and their video game misadventures may find that last phrase a bit rich. For clarity, I assume that by "Bloodlines treatment" Carl means "we're going to make a big 3D RPG with a lot of lore". Rather than "we're going to delay it so often it becomes a running joke, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">fire the original narrative director</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">hand it to a different studio</a> with no real track record for RPGs, then tell people it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more spiritual successor than sequel</a>". </p><!--more-->
<p>White Wolf are the official licensing and publishing entity for all World Of Darkness adaptations. They were acquired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> outfit Paradox Interactive in October 2015, and are now co-publishers for Bloodlines 2. As for the World of Darkness itself, this is a sprawling modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> fiction analogous to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which encompasses several apocalypses and several table-top RPGs.</p>
<p>While the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> is by far the most famous World Of Darkness video game adaptation, there are plenty more out there - 2003 hack-and-slash Hunter: The Reckoning and, much more recently, a bunch of Werewolf games, plus some mobile projects. In a new interview with PCGamesN, Carl made no bones of White Wolf's desire to keep cranking out the spin-offs.</p>
<p>"Who says we're not already?" he joked in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/world-of-darkness-games">PCGamesN</a>. "The answer is yes. All of those supernatural creatures have their own stories to tell, and many of them are just waiting their turn and for the right story to come along.</p>
<p>"It's not just Hunter and Werewolf," Carl went on. "It's no secret that, when we set up our in-house publishing business, we've been exploring many of the other World of Darkness games that people have been waiting for and that are underdeveloped. We've got our eyes on Mage, we've got our eyes on The Dark Ages, we've got our eyes on Changeling; we're spending a lot of time thinking about these three, and other games that people have been waiting for."</p>
<p>Carl is himself a former tabletop RPG game designer, having started out at D&amp;D creators Wizards of the Coast in the 1990s. In the chat with PCGN, he was especially enthusiastic about adapting Mage, a tabletop game that first released in 1993 and is, as you may guess, all about sorcery.</p>
<p>"I have spent considerable time thinking about what Mage would look like in a new edition," he said. "The world we live in today is very different from what we imagined it would look like when the White Wolf team were building those previous editions of Mage, and I think we're all looking forward to the challenges of figuring out how Prime and Paradox work in this world, as opposed to the world we thought we were going to get."</p>
<p>I'm not that familiar with Mage, but I gather from the White Wolf wikis that <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)">Prime</a> is one of the nine spheres of magic - it "governs the raw energy of reality". While <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_(MTAs)">Paradox</a> "is the collective force of consensual reality fighting back against the enlightened will of the mage."</p>
<p>This certainly seems adventurous, for a magic system, in that I can't quite picture how you'd translate all that into an everyday fireball spell. How am I supposed to splat cellar rats with *checks notes* an "Odyllic Force"? My goodness, could this be an arcane institution with <em>implications for things beside combat and levelling up</em>? I am pleased by the prospect of a video game based on such wild notions. Almost as much as I am sceptical of White Wolf's big promises, given their and Paradox's handling of the "spiritual successor" to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.</p>
<p>"There's no obstacle or gatekeeping function that would prevent any of these from making it out into a videogame and getting the Bloodlines treatment," Carl concluded. "It's a question of time, resources, the right development partners, and story." I don't know, Carl. The first three of those seem like pretty significant obstacles. They seem like much the same obstacles Bloodlines 2 has been smashing its pointy chops against since 2019, in fact. Maybe at least ship your new Vampire game - due in October, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">a recent round of layoffs at developers Chinese Room</a> - before you make any bets on the rest of the World of Darkness.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-world-of-darkness-rpgs-deserve-the-bloodlines-treatment-say-white-wolf-especially-mage-the-ascension]]></content:encoded>

IGN has asked Microsoft for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the memo, Spencer failed to confirm specifics, telling staff “any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The following message from Phil Spencer was shared to all gaming staff today:</p><blockquote>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</blockquote><blockquote>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</blockquote><blockquote>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.  </blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild">Spencer issued an update on Everwild</a> following repeated no-shows at various Xbox livestreams since its 2019 announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XboxEra</a>, Spencer listed Everwild as one of the games yet to come out that he was excited for, adding he’d recently visited Rare, which runs live service pirate adventure game Sea of Thieves, to get a look at Everwild and the progress the developers were making.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love back from the original one, so that one stays on the board.

It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they’re making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer said Microsoft had been able to give the developers of those games (State of Decay, the next game from Double Fine, and Everwild) time while still having a packed schedule of releases (bolstered, obviously, by the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can give those teams time,” Spencer said. “And next week I’m going to be up in Vancouver with the Coalition [Gears of War developer] — and how fun is that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everwild had faced concern amid reboot reports and the exit of creative director Simon Woodroffe in 2020. Rare filled the director's chair with veteran designer Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pinata, and Sea of Thieves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was Everwilds? Reports indicated it was a third-person adventure game with god game elements, but given how long it was in development, that may have changed.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenimax-online%E2%80%99s-new-mmorpg-has-been-canceled-too-after-7-years-of-development.1234200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's pretty much confirmed now that even ZeniMax Online's second MMORPG has been canceled amidst Microsoft's massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">wrote</a> about it on BlueSky, adding that the project had the codename 'Blackbird'.</p>



<p>ZeniMax Online is the developer behind the highly successful MMORPG Elder Scrolls Online. While continuing to update that game (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-developer-qa-theres-tons-of-exciting-stuff-we-havent-talked-about-thats-coming-to-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> a major update), though, they had also been building a separate team to create a new project. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/">reported</a> on it in November 2022, when this team had already worked for four and a half years and had swelled to over 200 developers.</p>



<p>The Creative Director was Ben Jones, who once revealed a few very high-level details about the project:</p>



<p><em>This is a considerable investment and a very large scope project.</em> <em>We're creating a new IP, so a lot of that started with a background for a world, a vision for a high-level world that we were going to create, and to a degree, a story that we wanted to tell.</em> <em>The biggest beats of that existed before my time here. My job was to take those components and to really put flesh on the bone, to create a core team that understood what my bosses were seeking to create.</em></p>



<p><em>The first two hires that we had on the team were a Lead Writer and what we call a Loremaster, someone who is responsible for the core tenants of the IP and all of the mythology that goes into the game. We work together along with our core creative team to establish what those core tenants are. We iterated on that. Our main story has changed 10 times in the last four and a half years as we evolve what the product is.</em></p>



<p>Jones has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346203934107103232/">posted</a> his first thoughts on LinkedIn, calling Project Blackbird the 'most exciting and ambitious' one he had worked on in his career. He is credited with having previously worked on Day of Defeat, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, several Battlefield 4 expansions, the space survival simulation game Into the Stars, and H1Z1: Just Survive.</p>



<p>Now, Windows Central has <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-cancellations-july-2025">added</a> a few tidbits on the developing story from their sources. The game would have been set in a fantasy world, they said, featuring dialogue branches not unlike Star Wars: The Old Republic or ZeniMax Online's own Elder Scrolls Online. The goal was to eventually make it the studio's primary focus as ESO wound down in time, but with its cancellation, the full attention of ZeniMax Online is undoubtedly back on that game.</p>



<p>Windows Central also says that Perfect Dark might be affected as well, although that's not yet confirmed.</p>
