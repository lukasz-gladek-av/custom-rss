<p>Details from the evidence documents from IWGB’s lawsuit against Rockstar have been revealed, hinting at 32-player lobbies for GTA 6 Online. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rockstar is under investigation for alleged union-busting, with IWGB claiming that the company fired employees who were “organising for better conditions”. Rockstar has denied these claims, stating the dismissal was due to employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing “confidential information” in insecure channels</a>. Now, details about this confidential information have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-hosted-a-32-player-session-suggesting-it-could-be-for-gta-6-online">Rockstar Hosted a 32-Player Session, Suggesting It Could Be for GTA 6 Online.</h2>



<p>The details about GTA 6 Online’s 32-player lobbies come from a recent YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuipPQDd_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-6-online-detail-revealed-in-new-court-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RockstarIntel</a>), in which Chris Bratt accessed a hard copy of the court documents in Glasgow. In these documents, Bratt read the Discord messages shared by Rockstar as evidence of employees leaking information. Across these messages, there was some information that was “so sensitive” that Rockstar’s barrister didn’t want to read them in court and asked the judge to read them privately. </p>



<p>The “top secret” messages Rockstar referred to have now been revealed, as Rockstar applied no reporting restrictions to them. The messages start with an employee talking about Rockstar not wanting “more than 13 people off at one time”, which was seemingly later reduced to “no more than 5 people off at a time”. </p>



<p>Then a message comes in as a response to a previous message that talks about a session they conducted, which was “difficult to do” and included 32 players. Another employee responded, stating that they have “multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organise a 32 player session and let people have their time off.” This is information regarding an “unannounced feature” in a game currently being developed by Rockstar. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s response also states that it is “gravely concerned” about the claimants sharing “highly confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to the content and features of an unannounced online service.” The claimants discussed the specific number of players planned for this service. However, it hasn’t been explicitly stated that the online service is indeed GTA 6 Online. </p>



<p>For context, GTA 5 Online features 32-player lobbies with 30 active players and 2 spectators. If this is indeed for GTA 6 online, then it won’t be a significant upgrade over the previous title. </p>



<p>At the same time, there was some evidence that Rockstar stated was directly related to GTA 6. Rockstar presented multiple messages as proof for each employee who was fired, but one employee received only one message as evidence. The message itself stated, “Nothing that I’ve heard in the North QA! Will keep you updated if that changes ofc.” Rockstar’s head of publishing, Jeniffer Kolbe, stated that this message “could indicate the stage of development that GTA VI was at for those familiar with the games industry and could also undermine team collaboration. </p>

<p>Workbenches in Hytale are a vital piece of equipment to help players in both survival and progression, opening the door to new items, recipes, and plenty more.</p>



<p>Given the number of Workbenches there are in Hytale, alongside other structures like the Furnace and Cooking Stove, it can be difficult to keep track of what you are missing, the items you need to collect to craft them, and what exactly each one is used for.</p>



<p>To ease the confusion, this Insider Gaming guide has a detailed breakdown of everything you need to know about Hytale’s Workbenches.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-hytale-workbenches-amp-how-to-make-them">All Hytale Workbenches &amp; How to Make Them</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll need plenty of room. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight types of Workbenches in Hytale, all of which have different uses, and some of which are not available immediately when you start the game.</strong></p>



<p>Workbenches in Hytale are geared towards specific uses, like the Farmer’s Workbench for creating reliable food sources at your base to the Furniture Workbench for kitting out your decor.</p>



<p>Apart from the initial Workbench, which can be crafted in your inventory, all of the others require interacting with the basic Workbench to craft. Additionally, three of the Workbenches are only unlocked when you upgrade your initial Workbench to Level 2, which requires a host of resources.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the Workbenches in Hytale, the requirements to unlock them, and the necessary ingredients to craft them.</p>

<p>You might need to manually apply the update – in which case you simply press '+' on the game's icon and select 'Software Update' – but otherwise, you should be good to go.</p>
<p>There are no official patch notes at the time of writing as we can see, but if you've been eagerly anticipating this new update, then you'll likely already know the gist. Version 3.0 contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resort Hotel</li>
<li>Island Speciality Requests</li>
<li>Slumber Island</li>
<li>Resetti's Reset Service</li>
<li>Collaborations (LEGO and The Legend of Zelda amiibo)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be crystal clear, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of the game is not yet live. This is available to purchase separately or via an Upgrade Pack. If you've pre-ordered the Upgrade Pack, you may see the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' icon on your home screen, but the original Switch 1 version will boot up when you open it.</p>

			<p>Following the launch of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/"><em>Steam Deck</em></a></strong> a few years back, which effectively created a brand new market for handheld gaming devices, <strong>Valve</strong> will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">launch the <em>Steam Machine</em> this year</a></strong> to further bridge the gap between gaming <strong>PCs</strong> and consoles in the living room.</p>

<p>On the other hand, developers looking for a Steam Frame Verified badge may have to face a stricter verification process, although <strong>Valve</strong> will <em>"be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback,"</em> <strong>Yang</strong> specified.</p>



<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It Just Works"</em> philosophy behind the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine</em></strong> has also been extended to another new piece of hardware launching this year, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Controller Puck,</em></strong> which can charge and pair a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam controller</em></strong> to any <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC</strong>.

<p>The system's specifications <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">meet the recommended requirements of most current games, enabling solid&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1080p</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p</strong>&nbsp;resolution gaming.

<p>As developers likely won't have <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">to optimize their games specifically for the Steam Machine as they have to for the now-dated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Deck</strong></em>&nbsp;hardware</span>, it stands to reason it will just be easier for developers to get a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</em></strong> badge if their games don't have massively high hardware requirements and have no trouble running on SteamOS.</p>

            <p>We're only two weeks into 2026, but the new year hasn't been kind to Ubisoft employees. Right after the closure of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft Halifax</a> and layoffs at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-continues-new-wave-of-layoffs-as-55-jobs-are-expected-to-be-cut-at-massive-and-stockholm-offices">Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, roles are reportedly being cut at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi too.</p>
<p>Game industry news and analysis site <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> shared on 14th January several employees at the studio were posting on LinkedIn about cuts happening <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">as far back as December 2025</a>. A bit of digging reveals <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">similar posts</a> by more ex-employees, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">the latest</a> appearing on the site earlier this week. The full impact of the layoffs at the studio is unclear, but it seems it's not being shut down.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a> was opened in 2011 and "serves as Ubisoft's Regional Hub for games development." The studio has worked on mobile games such as CSI: Hidden Crimes (pictured above) and the big free-to-play sandbox MMO <a href="https://www.growtopiagame.com/">Growtopia</a>.</p>
<p>The new wave of layoffs arrived shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft and Tencent formed the subsidiary Vantage Studios</a> to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry franchises. It is widely assumed those are the safest Ubisoft properties moving forward, which explains why studios not directly involved with them are currently being hit the hardest.</p><p>Ubisoft's 2026 release schedule has yet to be defined even if we know new triple-A heavy hitters are in development as we speak. For now, we're expecting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remakes</a> to help boost those numbers, and we heard of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">surprise "definitive edition" of the first Division game</a> earlier this week too.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Josef Fares, known for his outspoken and often expletive laden thoughts (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/josef-fares-sweary-oscars-rant-hidden-in-it-takes-two">remember <em>that </em>Oscars rant</a>?), has now shared his opinion on one of the moment's hottest topics: AI.</p>
<p>AI really can't be escaped these days. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. It is fair to say that figure will likely be higher now.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>But, what of Fares' studio Hazelight, which has released acclaimed games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> since its conception.</p>
<p>"We have been working with AI for a long time in game development," Fares said during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. The vocal developer added that if an AI tool is "helpful to get your vision out there", then he doesn't see "why we shouldn't look into it". However, when it comes to generative AI, he understands that's where people are less keen to see the technology adopted, and this controversial tool is where "the problem" is.</p><p>"It's really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn't gone up much," Fares explained. "Maybe this is the limit of it. You get someone generating a game concept and saying, 'oh look what might happen in five years?' But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better."</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, though, Fares stated there still needs to be "someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is", and therefore he doesn't  "see AI taking over". That said, he admitted it's also "really hard to answer", because: "Who knows what happens in the future?"</p>

<p>Elsewhere during his chat with The Game Business, Fares also shared his support for EA, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gets-more-than-they-deserve-says-split-fiction-director-josef-fares">the Split Fiction publisher gets "more shit than they deserve"</a>.</p>
<p>As for AI, last week a patent filed by Sony over a year ago resurfaced, revealing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-patented-an-ai-gaming-ghost-that-will-play-playstation-games-for-you-when-you-get-stuck">company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>BioWare’s misbegotten mech-me-do Anthem died this week after EA pulled the official servers. It’s a sad day for people who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-review">saw promise in the game’s sci-fi world and flight mechanics</a>, however spoiled by the always-online looter-shooting, and a happy day for people who really hated being called “freelancer” in community bulletins. I was an actual freelancer when Anthem came out in 2019, and I didn’t get no mech suit. At least when the Destiny developers call you a Guardian, it feels sort of romantic, rather than like rubbing your nose in your own economic precarity. </p>
<p>Anyway, ‘officially unsupported’ doesn’t necessarily mean ‘gone for good’. In one of his many tell-all videos, former Anthem executive producer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> kingpin Mark Darrah has outlined a plan for bringing Anthem back as a single-player RPG, with a “conservative” budget of $10 million.</p><!--more-->
<p>Darrah makes his case for an Anthem re-release at the end of a gigantic new video "The Truth About What Happened on Anthem", as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-local-servers-existed-at-bioware">Eurogamer</a>. The first step, he says, would be to update the game for current gen consoles, introduce the latest graphics features and lock it to 60 frames a second. “You're going to spend some engineering probably making that be pretty solid,” Darrah explains. “But it's not too difficult because you're getting there to a large degree by throwing better hardware at it.”</p>
<p>Hmm! I feel like I need a third-party programmer’s opinion on this. I’m not used to seeing the words “not too difficult” in connection to updating games to run on new hardware. Then again, I didn't preside over the development of a bunch of Mass Effect and Dragon Age games, so what do I know.</p>

<p>“Two, and this is a big one, you move to locally hosted servers,” Darrah goes on. “Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months before launch. I don't know that they still work, but they the code is there to be salvaged and recovered.” Local server support would, of course, eliminate the publisher expense of keeping the game online. Presumably, the game's operating costs would need to rely on player donations, as with the formerly NCSoft-run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/city-of-heroes-community-run-private-server-gets-official-license-from-ncsoft">City Of Heroes</a>.</p>
<p>The lion’s share of the work in Darrah’s proposal consists of “[pivoting] to something that’s more about single player storytelling”, once you’ve got Anthem running on local servers.</p>
<p>“This is a game where the combat is designed around a group of four people,” he acknowledges. “So where most of your $10 million needs to go is in the creation of AI party members. And since this is BioWare, go all the way and make them companions. There are some existing characters that you could potentially promote into companions, but I think you're you would find that there is actually a lower friction route by making three to five new characters with dialogue, with plot arcs that are brand new to the series that are people who would go with you through the existing story of Anthem, as well as their companion content. </p><p>“You could go as low as three,” Darrah continues. “That's basically just enough to fill out your party. By going beyond three, you're able to have stronger personalities and people can potentially like or dislike them. Or if you want to tie the characters to specific Javelin styles or combat styles, it allows you to go into that as well.” I have to confess, I don’t quite follow Darrah here – surely if you have more characters, those personalities will get fewer resources apiece, and be less memorable?</p>
<p>“Writing those characters, not very difficult,” the elder BioWayfarer asserts. “Making the characters be able to move with you, that's where a lot of your work is going to have to go. You are essentially going to have to figure out how an AI-controlled Javelin pilot can stick with you out in the world. There are lots of Creepy Watson style tricks and cheats that you can use to make it easier, but a big amount of your work is going to have to go into the design of making those characters stay with you out in the world, making them be able to fight in a meaningful and useful way.”</p>
<p>Quick round of applause here for the drive-by mention of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWQk8zmpOs">Creepy Watson</a>, who is very much my favourite point of overlap between Sherlock and Slender Man.</p>
<p>Darrah feels that if you can accomplish all this, “what you've essentially reverse-engineered is a BioWare game without romances with a decent, BioWare-style story with companions that can be played as a single player game.” He observes with 100% correctness that this would appeal to the many who didn’t play Anthem because they hate multiplayer looting and shooting. But he cautions that you “probably” wouldn’t be able to sell it for the current triple-A price of $70 a pop, and even then, he can’t see such a game selling “five, six, seven million copies”.</p><p>Needless to say, Darrah doesn’t expect EA to be keen, commenting that his plan “is very antithetical to what was being investigated in terms of fixing Anthem in the past”. The reference here is to Anthem Next, EA’s abortive attempt at a live service reboot. </p>
<p>Darrah washes all this down with some thoughts on game preservation at large. “We're entering into a period where we have disappeared media - media that becomes unavailable through direct intentional actions by the rights holder,” he says, drawing parallels with Disney’s now-unavailable Willow TV series and DC’s reportedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batgirl_(film)">near-complete, yet unreleased Batgirl movie</a>. </p>
<p>“Should companies be required to make their games playable indefinitely?” Darrah muses. “I think there's a conversation to be had there. The things that would have been required to make Anthem playable in its entirety from the beginning back in 2019 were are substantial and they would have compromised parts of the game. But you can imagine different forms of a playable Anthem. Like we just discussed, there is a possible path to a singleplayer version of Anthem that doesn't require dedicated servers. So maybe there's a version of legislation that could be imagined that keeps games playable in some state beyond their intended lifespan.”</p>
<p>Darrah throws in a shout-out to Stop Killing Games, the consumer movement to introduce laws requiring publishers not to render games unplayable by taking their servers offline. “Their goals are a little bit more ambitious than simply having a conversation,” he notes. “But at least now the conversation is actually happening.” </p><p>SKG are certainly making headlines. Recently, a handful of UK Green Party members <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-green-party-mps-would-be-compelled-to-support-stop-killing-games-if-a-proposed-policy-amendment-passes">proposed an amendment</a> to make support for the group's objectives official policy. The SKG petition has also been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">debated in Parliament</a>, with one Labour MP arguing that "the warning signs are here in this industry and to act now would be far less painful than to wait until this practice has become entrenched."</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/</link>
            <guid>1405534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A LinkedIn profile from an Edios Montreal employee has revealed that the studio is working on an unannounced ‘AAAA’ game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>The finding was posted by LinkedIn scouter <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a> on X, and corroborates what I have heard about the project.</p>







<p>In December 2025, I posted to X that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Eidos Montreal layoffs</a> were connected to a project codenamed P11, which has been reducing its headcount as of late as it heads into Beta and eventually, launch.</p>



<p>P11 is Eidos Montreal’s new IP, which, according to sources, has been in development since around 2019 and has faced significant setbacks and issues along the way. It’s understood that the project has seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested, which, unsurprisingly, would warrant the ‘AAAA’ tag.</p>



<p>As mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?si=S3YyG2iZjDNKCuoZ&amp;t=2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a>, the game is an open-world action-adventure game in third-person. </p>



<p>Funnily enough, I only know about the game because I was pursuing finding out more about the game last year for a book I am working on about cancelled video games, because it looked surprisingly familiar to the cancelled survival game WiLD by Wild Sheet Studio. The similarities led me to believe that the IP had been bought by Eidos Montreal / Embracer, but to my knowledge, that project is entirely dead, and P11 is a new IP but with some striking similarities.</p>







<p>As for when P11 will be revealed remains to be seen, but it’s believe that the game will be ready to be shown later this year if things go well.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new IP created by Eidos Montreal? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick has made a number of claims about the state of his former company, Call of Duty, and the console market as part of a response to a lawsuit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kotick, who left Activision Blizzard at the end of 2023 having sold the company to Xbox maker Microsoft for $69 billion dollars, is battling investors who claim he rigged the sale to keep his job and $400 million in change-of-control benefits, and to insulate himself from claims he knew about widespread sexual harassment at Activision. Kotick has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The investors are led by Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-fonden (AP7). They have accused Kotick of rushing into the Microsoft merger, and contend the $95 per share takeover price was too low from the outset. AP7 names Kotick, Activision Blizzard, and its owner, Microsoft, as defendants.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/gettyimages-2224569970-1768385898087.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Former Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick is battling a lawsuit over the sale of the company to Microsoft. Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a>, Kotick has now issued his response to the allegations. In it he accuses Swedish game company Embracer, which owns the rights to the likes of Tomb Raider, Dead Island, and Lord of the Rings, of being involved with the lawsuit and benefitting from it, something the company has denied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of Kotick’s defence uses the declining financial performance of Activision Blizzard, Call of Duty, and the console market in recent years to back up his claim that selling to Microsoft at $95 a share was the right thing to do at that time. And one quote in particular is being picked up by the Call of Duty community as being of interest:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today, given that console sales are at an all-time low and Call of Duty sales are off over 60% from the prior year, Plaintiff should be expressing extreme gratitude for the foresight Activision leadership demonstrated in consummating this transaction.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Game File points out, Kotick failed to provide evidence of his 60% sales decline claim, and neither Microsoft nor Activision have announced a sales figure for Black Ops 7 yet. But we do know Black Ops 7 has struggled in sales terms compared to Black Ops 6, a fact that's reflected in everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider"><u>European sales figures</u></a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>Activision's own admissions</u></a>. Circana has reported that November full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 finished below those of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 last November, with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launching in the October 2024 tracking period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, none of this takes into account the Game Pass effect. Call of Duty now launches day one on Microsoft’s subscription service, which will no doubt have an impact on sales at least on Xbox consoles. But a 60% sales decline is an enormous drop-off even with Game Pass considered. IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is data to back up Kotick’s claim about consoles. November 2025 was a shockingly terrible month for video game sales in the U.S. Indeed it was the worst November in video game hardware unit sales, and the worst in physical software dollar sales the U.S. has seen since 1995. More specifically, hardware spending was down a whopping 27% year-over-year to $695 million, the lowest hardware spending total for November since 2005's $455 million. Even worse, unit sales reached 1.6 million, which is the lowest November total since 1995's 1.4 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's representative of declines across the board. Xbox Series hardware sales were down 70% year-over-year. PS5 sales were down over 40%, and combined unit sales of Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 were down over 10% from Switch sales last year, despite this being a launch year for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kotick repeated his 60% claim elsewhere in his response, where he took a shot at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s attempt to block Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard buyout. Part of the FTC’s argument was that Microsoft owning Call of Duty would give it an unfair advantage in the gaming market. But Kotick insists that the struggles of Call of Duty in the face of stiff competition from the likes of Battlefield show that not to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Company’s actual performance since January 2022 is telling, uniformly missing the Long Range Plans’ target metrics — which should come as no surprise, given that the Company historically missed nearly all of the ambitious targets set forth in its Long Range Plans, a fact known well to the Board when the deal was negotiated,” Kotick’s response reads. “All told, had the deal not gone through, this would have likely resulted in a substantially lower stock price, as is easily established by Activision’s financial performance post-closing, which has been far below the ambitious targets contained in the plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Call of Duty is on track to perform over 60% below last year because of intense competition from titles like Battlefield — destroying the FTC’s now defeated argument about Call of Duty’s purported monopoly and the lack of competition in the first-person action game category.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Black Ops 7, Activision announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the Call of Duty franchise, including promising never to release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops). Activision released Modern Warfare 2 in 2022, Modern Warfare 3 in 2023, Black Ops 6 in 2024, and Black Ops 7 in 2025. Activision Blizzard is expected to announce this year's Call of Duty in the summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

		<p>Four thousand, eight hundred and eleven days. One hundred and fifty-eight months and two days. Thirteen years, two months and two days. Whatever way you want to frame it, it’s going to have been a heck of a long time between the launches of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, should the latter manage to hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">its latest release date on 19th November 2026</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime opera, and from what little we’ve seen of the game so far, it looks like they’re fully embracing all the wild excess and craziness that you’d expect from a fictionalised rendition of Miami and the Florida Keys.</p>



<p>It looks like this will be a bit of a modern-day Bonnie &amp; Clyde style story with its two protagonists. Lucia Caminos is the series’ first female lead, who’s coming fresh out of a stint in prison, while Jason Duval is working for the local drug gangs. The pair are thrust together after a failed bank robbery, and are then swept up in a grand conspiracy.</p>

<p>As good as it will be to have a new GTA single player story, Rockstar and Take Two are really banking on the next rendition of GTA Online picking up where GTA V’s has left off. It’s this mode that has ballooned Take Two’s coffers over the past decade, and the online platform has grown and evolved massively to give players more things to do, more missions, more career paths to follow, and to front for user-generated content. A new GTA Online will necessarily get back to basics without feeling too hollow. A slow rollout of content was a big part of Red Dead Online’s rapid decline, though Rockstar will have a pretty singular focus for GTA.</p>

<p>But will it actually arrive in November? Rockstar games are prone to at least a couple delays, and GTA 6 has already had two. With its official announcement and reveal in December 2023, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">the tail was pinned on a 2025 release date</a>, but as the higher ups lifted the blindfold to see if they’d hit the target, they realised they’d need to have another go. So it was that by the middle of last year, they decided to get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">a bit more specific and target May 2026</a> instead. Any closer? Not quite. Let’s try November 2026 now.</p>
<p>The problem is that, while there’s still an awful lot of people excited for the next GTA, each delay and announcement has kept the game release at least a year into the future. That’s far away enough that you can absolutely imagine the team getting to that latest six month deadline and realising they, once again, need a bit more time.&nbsp;In the here and now, that means we still have GTA 6 right up there within our top 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a>, but we’re a touch more excited for a couple of other titles…</p>

            <p>Following a strong launch back in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> unleashed a notable first season of content, which was expected to end around 20th January. However, following heated feedback, EA and Battlefield Studios are saying Season 2 will now arrive in February.</p>
<p>The meaty update on the state of the game and what's next <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/497217247660478118?l=english">arrived on 13th January</a>, after the quiet Christmas break. The teams don't go into much depth about the "community feedback" that prompted the decision to delay season two until 17th February, but it reaffirms their vision as explained around the game's launch: Content won't be pushed out just to keep the live service going if more tinkering is needed.</p>

<p>The extension of season one will add almost an entire month to the battle pass completion time, and new content is coming to keep the faithful busy until 17th February. "The Season One extension update to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and REDSEC will be released on 20th January, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season One Battle Pass until the start date of Season Two," the team said.</p>
<p>The 'Frostfire Bonus Path' will drop on 27th January, and add "new customisation rewards, including a Weapon Package and a Soldier Skin, as well as XP Boosts". This new path of the season one battle pass will only use regular weekly challenges for progression after criticism of past bonus challenges. Moreover, it can be worked on alongside the main path. And yes, owners of the premium pass will get extra cosmetics. Expect more details soon.</p><p>"Later this update, we'll be celebrating Valentine's Day: commit to your duo now, or forever hold your peace. We're also introducing another set of Daily Login Rewards and several Double XP Weekends throughout the update period," the latest post added. Events aren't slowing down, it seems.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 continues to enjoy success, but the (admittedly impatient) hardcore military shooter player base has been quite vocal about hit registration issues and the need for bigger maps even if Season One already delivered on that front. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> missing most of its shots, Battlefield is in a good position at the moment, but looking at how massive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> is becoming, EA and Battlefield Studios could be on the clock to please the diehards before they decide to move on.</p>
<p>Needless to say, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vince-zampella-co-creator-of-call-of-duty-and-respawn-entertainment-has-died">Vince Zampella's recent passing</a> might have caused some chaos and confusion at Battlefield Studios, as he was the man tasked with leading the charge on Battlefield 6's development and the series' future after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">2042</a> nearly killed the franchise.</p>
<p>That's a job well done, I say.</p>

            <p>Let the runes of protection blaze upon the vestments of the machine spirit; let psalm pervade circuitry and obliterate the Enemy’s designs; let fire and catechism fall upon the creeping ruin of Abominable Intelligence. Brothers! The hour of motion is at hand. Games Workshop have banned their employees from using generative AI tools to create or design Warhammer stuff, because their senior management don’t consider the technology very “exciting”. Their CEO also seems irked about software companies shoving generative AI into every new device or system update, whether it’s desired or not. The tech-priests are coming for your candy ass, ChatGPT!</p>
<p>That said, they don’t appear to be prohibiting the usage of generative AI by partners, including game developers, and they will allow senior staff “to continue to be inquisitive about the technology”, which I am tempted to read as a sop to investors driven stir-crazy by NVIDIA’s share price. Omnissiah be… somewhat enthused? Relatively undisappointed?</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Games Workshop’s stance reflects concerns about the company’s art being appropriated and used for generative AI ‘training’. I’m sure they’re also worried about a backlash from Warhammer’s massive community of miniature painters and other external creatives (recently, poster marketplace Displate <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">got it in the neck</a> over AI "red flags" in a Warhammer 40,000 artwork). Speaking during the company’s <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/7lRczzQBbvA22PEmSVJN8K/2de2f722e20e1d69b9aa3ed4e1b95678/2025-26_half_year_report_v3.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a> yesterday, Games Workshop chief executive Kevin Rountree shared the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>A very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it. We do have a few senior managers that are: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not. </p>
<p>We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio - hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, all this seemingly just applies to Games Workshop itself, for the moment, but it’s sure to have ripple effects among Warhammer videogame developers such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a> studio Owlcat, who revealed back in 2024 that they were <a href="https://x.com/OwlcatGames/status/1763946679470788722?s=20">using generative AI</a> "for additional work with concepts and speeding up some internal processes". Games Workshop are historically pretty zealous about how their designs and setting are recreated by third parties.</p><p>While there are plenty of generative AI evangelists on the shop, including a few big cheeses at EA, Ubisoft and most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-director-goes-all-in-on-ai-as-south-koreas-games-industry-looks-to-compete-on-the-global-stage">Stellar Blade developers Shift-Up</a>, there is also a mounting tide of resistance to generative AI adoption. Recently, Running With Scissors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">cancelled a whole game</a> over suspicions of generative AI usage in a trailer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse have banned generative AI art from their games, and Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">partly walked back</a> their own implementations of the tech in the forthcoming Divinity.</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you've laid hands on the plastic contours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, you’ve probably seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a> in action: badges of honour (or of 'Unsupported' disgrace) on a game’s Steam store page, reflecting how well it runs and plays on the portable PC per Valve’s in-house testing. The programme is being expanded to include the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> too, and is set to bestow a lot more games with Steam Machine Verified status, given what a Valve designer calls "fewer restraints" in their judging criteria.</p>
<p>Lawrence Yang – who’s worked on the new Machine, the Deck, and the also-incoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> – told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Game Developer</a> that it’ll be easier for a game to achieve a coveted green checkmark sticker with its SteamOS mini-PC, and that Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" for its new verification checks as the Steam Deck’s. Even if, especially in the case of the Frame VR headset, different requisites will apply. This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-own-any-steam-deck-verified-games-then-youve-already-got-a-guarantee-theyll-work-on-the-steam-machine">follows a Valve blog post</a> that put things in simpler terms: if a game is Steam Deck Verified, it'll be Steam Machine Verified too.</p>
<p>Rather than a lowering of standards, for the Steam Machine specifically, it’s pretty obvious that “lifting constraints” simply reflects differences in the hardware’s power and use cases versus the handheld Steam Deck. Yang didn’t specify details, but it’s easy to guess which criteria from the Deck Verified programme weren't as urgently applicable: for instance, some only score a 'Playable' badge instead of full Verified status because they include small text that’s harder to read on the 7in, 800p screen. The Steam Machine intends to hook up to TVs and desktop monitors, so that’s probably not worth including in the new device’s rulebook.</p>

<p>Considering the shared use of SteamOS, other touchstones will definitely remain, like whether a game can display the correct gamepad button glyphs (Valve would very much like you to play the Steam Machine with their revamped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>) or whether it needs occasional keyboard input. Valve will be testing for performance too, though since the Steam Machine is significantly beefier in the graphical muscles than the Deck, it’d naturally win more Playable and Verified statuses here anyway.</p><p>This is all good news for players and developers alike – the former get more at-a-glance transparency on which games in their library will work, and the latter (as Game Developer points out) a handy marketing tool. It’s a shame, then, that the Steam Deck itself has become mired in uncertainty since its reveal late last year, the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component shortages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">price rises</a> raising questions around the Gabecube’s affordability and lack of a concrete release date beyond "early 2026".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new court filing, the Former Activision Blizzard CEO stated that Call of Duty’s performance fell by 60% compared to 2024 due to games like Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>New developments have started popping up in the Delaware lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision, and other board members, including Kotick. The former CEO has already claimed that this lawsuit was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotick-says-activision-lawsuit-was-meant-to-help-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to benefit the Embracer Group</a> at Activision’s expense. Additionally, he has spoken about Call of Duty’s performance visibly declining since his departure.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-s-performance-affected-by-battlefield-6-defeats-ftc-s-argument-about-lack-of-competition">Call of Duty’s Performance Affected by Battlefield 6, Defeats FTC’s Argument About Lack of Competition</h2>



<p><span>A report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank">GameFile</a></span>&nbsp;indicates that Kotick has acknowledged that Microsoft has benefited from the Activision Blizzard deal. However, he noted that the recent performance of the company has fallen “well below” their long-term targets. Kotick specifically addressed the performance of Call of Duty, mentioning that it is projected to perform over 60 percent below last year’s figures due to intense competition from titles such as Battlefield.</p>



<p>Kotick also points out that this fall effectively undermines the FTC’s argument regarding a “lack of competition in the first-person action game category” due to the acquisition. For those unaware, the FTC was attempting to block the deal, arguing that it would diminish competition in both the console and cloud markets, ultimately harming consumers by leading to higher prices and reduced innovation in the gaming industry.</p>







<p>In other news, EA has announced that the start of Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC Season 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been delayed</a>. Additionally, Activision has released&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a>&nbsp;for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

<p>A notable addition here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-january">which is also set to arrive on Xbox Game Pass on 20th January</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is another good'un, in my humble opinion. But, don't just take my word for it. Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin was also rather taken with it on its release, awarding it four out of five stars. "Violent stakes once again meet zany shenanigans in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the series' much-improved second RPG," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Eurogamer's Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review</a>.</p>
<p>Should this leak prove accurate, the above games will be joining the likes of Need for Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> and Core Keeper, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">which were added for all PS Plus members earlier this month</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> might be the online shooters of the moment, but that doesn't mean other recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> have gone under. In fact, NetEase's take on the property remains a strong alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> which has received tonnes of love since its late 2024 debut. Now, Deadpool is almost here, and his gameplay trailer packs a punch.</p>
<p>The 'Merc with a Mouth' was finally confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DY9eYEx6KQ">during last month's Game Awards</a>, after plenty of leaks and datamines. Marvel Rivals has been expanding at a much better pace than the aforementioned Blizzard-developed hero shooter ever did, typically dropping two heroes (or villains) per season into the roster, alongside new maps and modes. Traditionally, each hero has a single strict role (tank, DPS, or healer) as per the subgenre's conventions. However, Deadpool, much like in the comics and movies, writes his own rules… literally. You can check out Deadpool's trailer below.</p>

<p>Video games including Wade Wilson have acknowledged his fourth-wall-breaking abilities through dialogue and maybe a handful of zanier comic book moments. Gameplay-wise, he has always been represented as a goofy mercenary (who won't shut up) with access to lots of blades and guns. I mean, on a basic level, that's who he is. The Marvel Rivals team has taken the character's kit to the next level though.</p><p>My first impression is Wade could be a nightmare to properly balance after he arrives on 16th February. He can effortlessly swap between the Vanguard (tank), Duelist (DPS), and Strategist (healer) roles, and each kit comes with plenty of abilities that dish out incredible amounts of damage and notable buffs for his allies.</p>
<p>When NetEase first teased he'd be a flexible character, I certainly wasn't expecting him to whip out a comic book in the middle of a match and choose who he wants to be <em>inside </em>the game. That's the most Deadpool thing ever though.</p>
<p>Other highlights in the trailer include Deadpool taking selfies, his enemies being beaten up by comic book drawings on their screens, and a stylish MVP screen which also breaks the traditional boundaries of the game. I think it's safe to say this is the best adaptation of the character we've seen in a video game so far, and the fact it's all part of a fast-paced online shooter only makes it even more impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w">Season 6 of Marvel Rivals</a> (dubbed 'Night at the Museum') also kicks off this Friday, 16th January, and on top of Deadpool's arrival, players are hoping for matchmaking improvements and more quality of life fixes and tweaks. While the hero shooter remains healthy and is carried by cross-play across all platforms, its player numbers on Steam have steadily gone down due to a bigger focus on skins and seasonal content over keeping the game tidy and welcoming.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> last year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

            <p>A first round of hotfixes has arrived for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, following the Minecrafty sandboxer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-out-now-and-its-devs-are-advising-those-suffering-download-issues-or-errors-to-keep-plugging-away">arrival in early access</a> form yesterday. Developers Hypixel have also offered some insight into which aspects of it they're planning to prioritise working on in the coming months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving right into <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">the note</a>s for this initial round of hotfixing, you'll naturally find a number of the "most critical" initial teething issues folks reported running into upon firing the game up for the first time. For example, you'll now get a warning if your computer's time is out of date, since this had caused some "authentication issues", with the launcher login process as a whole hopefully now less likely to serve you such errors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to setting up servers, Hypixel have added a message letting you know whether authentication is required after your server boots up and made sure you'll be automatically switched into offline mode if your online session runs into a hiccup which invalidates it. A number of crash causes have also been ironed out, including some caused by simply using buckets - that fix will require you to destroy and replace any workbenches which now aren't working as intended. Picking certain hair styles before doing your eyebrows in the character creator is another of these potential returners-to-desktop which have been dealt with.</p>
<p>Alongside delivering this round of initial fixes, as part of <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a longer post</a> celebrating Hytale's early access launch, Hypixel have offered a bit of insight into what you can expect them to be doing in the near future:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the first few months, we intend to deliver updates quickly and frequently, as there is still a large backlog of obvious construction sites we need to tackle before we can move into larger, more bespoke updates and patch cadences. The work on the official minigames will begin in the coming months, enabling us to create new systems and features that expand gameplay and provide wider access to 3rd-party servers.</p>
<p>As a side note, we already have prototypes of social features, such as friend lists and proximity voice chat, in development. Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time!</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new court filing from the Former Activision Blizzard CEO claims that the Delaware lawsuit was designed to benefit Embracer Group; however, Embracer has denied these allegations.  </p>



<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, the Delaware lawsuit was initiated by the Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden, commonly known as AP7. This fund has accused the former CEO of accelerating the acquisition process in order to overshadow the sexual misconduct scandals that were emerging against the company in late 2021. The lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and various board members, including Bobby Kotick, has now been met with a response from the former CEO.</p>











<p>The former CEO of Activision Blizzard stated that “this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision.” Kotick’s response added that this situation made it more difficult for Activision to attract new talent and hindered its ability to expand through mergers and acquisitions, a strategy it has historically relied on for growth. </p>



<p>The Embracer Group has denied the claims made by the former Activision Blizzard CEO, stating that “perhaps difficult to accept for Mr. Kotick, but we did not and do not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision.” </p>







<p>In other news, Activision has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

		<p>Mutliverse has announced that it is delaying the launch of its colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid PAX Autocratica by a month to address performance, stability, and balancing issues that have been raised. Initially, PAX Autocratica was going to launch on February 2nd into early access, but now it will launch on March 4th instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9bREKlyMq4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the dev team at Multiverse said, <em>“After review by the Supreme Council, a directive has been issued regarding the deployment of Pax Autocratica. <wbr>The Early Access launch has been rescheduled to March 4, 2026. This decision was not made lightly. Recent internal evaluations and field reports have identified several areas that require further refinement before the State is ready to open Early Access operations. <wbr>These include:<wbr><wbr><wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Core balancing adjustments<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Stability and performance improvements<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Initial onboarding and tutorial refinement</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition, we have received a significant number of Quality of Life requests that we intend to address Our objective remains unchanged: <wbr>to launch Early Access with a build that is stable and fully enjoyable.”</em></p>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also previously confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse has previously made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em>&nbsp;“1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>

		<p>Embark has released a new update for ARC Raiders, and while update 1.11.0 is not a big one it does come off the back of a big milestone. Embark has confirmed that since launch ARC Raiders has had 12 million players, and that everyone who has logged into the game since launch up to January 13th would be gifted a gilded pickaxe raider tool. The update itself addresses a key card exploit so players can no longer keep them after use, and balancing changes to a couple of weapons. There is also the launch of the Abyss cosmetic set.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpeJjQDXNAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>ARC Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kettle – <wbr>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
<li>Trigger ‘Nade – Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
<li><wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.<wbr></li>
<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders Review</a></h2>
<p>In our ARC Raiders review, Tuffcub said, <em>“ARC Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Long-Awaited Minecraft-Like MMO Hytale Launches in Early Access and Seemingly Registers Big Player Numbers Right Away]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1405444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the <strong>Minecraft-like MMO</strong> that was recently revived by its original creator (who <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the rights back from Riot Games</a></strong>), is now <strong>finally out in early access</strong>. The game can be purchased <a href="https://store.hytale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the official website</a> (not <strong>Steam</strong>, although Hypixel said Hytale could launch on Valve's platform at a later date) with three options available to customers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard - $24.39</strong>, includes the Voyager, Savanna, and Forest Guardian cosmetic sets (with the Forest Guardian Cape)</li>



<li><strong>Supporter - $42.69</strong>, includes all the above plus the Featherbound, Scavenger, and Arctic Scout sets, each with their capes, as well as the Knight Cape and Explorer Goggles.</li>



<li><strong>Cursebreaker - $85.39</strong>, includes all the above plus 4 additional cosmetic sets (Hope of Gaia, Void Hero, Pop Star, Voidbearer) and 2 additional exclusive capes (Royal Emmissary, New Beginning).</li>
</ul>



<p>Without the open data that would have been available via Steam, it's hard to say how the launch is going. There was a rumor that <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, the game's creator, had shared that over 2.8 million users were in the game, but that rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qc1q18/comment/nzi3dj9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has since been largely disproven</a>, on account of anyone being able to join servers with any name when the game launched (this issue has already been patched). Still, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011179217329795221">via his official X account</a>, Collins-Laflamme did share that the Hypixel team was seeing a 'VERY HIGH rate of new Hytale players', which temporarily caused login issues that should now be resolved. Furthermore, just two days ago, he had noted that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio's next two years of work had already been funded based merely on pre-order sales</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In just eight weeks, the development team took a build that was over four years old, merged hundreds of branches, and fixed core systems (camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, audio, and rendering), while also squashing thousands of bugs. Even so, Hypixel warns that this is a true early access release: unpolished and still lacking a lot of stuff. What's in the game, anyway?</p>



<p><strong>Exploration Mode</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>An infinite, procedurally generated world with beautiful biomes, ancient structures, friendly creatures, and dangerous monsters</li>



<li>Explore, build a home, grow crops, craft items and equipment, play with friends</li>



<li>Discover the Forgotten Temple and uncover the first elements of the&nbsp;<strong>Cursebreaker story arc</strong>&nbsp;(to unfold in future updates)</li>



<li><strong>Mantling feature</strong>&nbsp;for greater freedom and control in navigating the world</li>



<li><strong>Unified progression and crafting system</strong>&nbsp;with expandable inventories, upgradable workbenches that interact with storage, and specialized crafting stations for hundreds of block and decoration types</li>



<li><strong>Ancient Gateway</strong>: Craft and place at your home to venture into temporary worlds called&nbsp;<strong>Fragments of Orbis</strong>&nbsp;(eventually offering timed adventures from low-intensity exploration to difficult combat and loot extraction)</li>



<li><strong>Memories system</strong>: Collect memories by exploring and interacting with creatures and factions, then return them to The Heart of Orbis for permanent world rewards and upgrades</li>



<li><strong>High mobility combat</strong>&nbsp;with diverse weapons featuring unique abilities</li>



<li><strong>Farming system</strong>&nbsp;with various crops and plants convertible into food and potions</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Creative Mode</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>In-game and standalone tools for building and creativity</li>



<li>Features include block rotation, previews, and connected block textures</li>



<li>Specialized entity tools for creators</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Modding Support (Day 1)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive modding capabilities with asset pack management, assets editor, worldgen editors</li>



<li>Partnerships with Blockbench and CurseForge for Day 1 modding support</li>



<li>Tools for big projects and long-term content creation</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of that, Hytale already offers multiplayer support in all modes. As for what's next, the upcoming Adventure Mode will introduce rich story and narrative elements, deeper progression systems, dungeons with boss fights, and more. Hypixel will also soon start working on the official Minigames, and more social features, such as friends lists and guilds, are on the way. Lastly, the World Gen V2, featuring the complete, restored world of Orbis, is also a long-term goal.</p>



<p>Hytale will eventually launch on consoles as well, while Hypixel is still evaluating the feasibility of a mobile version. Did you jump into this nifty blocky game world yet? Let us know in the comments.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hazelight's outspoken studio founder Josef Fares believes EA has been painted to be the villain much more than other companies, stating: "There's not a publisher in the world that hasn't fucked up now and then."</p>
<p>Fares through his studio Hazelight has partnered with EA for all three of its games: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. Now, the director has said if Hazelight didn't have a good relationship with EA, then it quite simply would not work with the publisher any more.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"There are a lot of great people at EA," Fares said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. "They know how we work. They respect it and they leave us be." He added he feels "EA is getting more shit than they deserve", remarking that "everybody's done something that's not good", namechecking Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony.</p>
<p>"But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy," the Hazelight head continued. "For us, it's a super good collaboration. I'm very open about [it]. If it was bad, I would've said that in this interview as well. But we have a great relationship."</p><p>Fares again reiterated this is not to say EA hasn't made its own share of mistakes, just like the rest of us. "All the people I am surrounded with at EA are gamers," Fares said. "They love games. It's not like I'm sitting with corporate people with suits. It's not like that."</p>
<p>Closing this train of thought, Fares stated in no uncertain terms: "And people should not worry, because Hazelight will do always what it wants."</p>
<p>But, why is it EA appears to be being 'villainised' at the moment? Well, at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA shareholders approved</a> the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law"> proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms. Should the acquisition go through, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>This has left a bad taste in the mouth of many due to the country's notoriously poor human rights record, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">resulted in public outcry and petitions from video game unions</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">human rights groups</a>. Over the weekend, EA said to its community that "the values of The Sims are unchanged", after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">multiple high profile The Sims content creators "removed themselves" from the company's Creator Network</a>.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Josef Fares/X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Hazelight, its most recent release Split Fiction was met with wide praise on its debut last year. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">reads our five star review</a>.</p><p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>. Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Split Fiction film adaptation starring Sydney Sweeney was also announced to be in the works last year</a>, with Jon M Chu of Wicked fame set to direct.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/14/travellers-refrain-review/</link>
            <guid>1405426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Traveller’s Refrain is a game that will make you feel sleepy. I don’t mean to suggest the game is boring, far from it. Rather, this isometric Zelda-like has a meditative thoughtful vibe that brings on a state of mindful chill that could, just could, make you briefly close your eyes. For a few minutes. Just make sure you’ve got your little wrist holders on to avoid any unnecessary damage to your Switch when you nod off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Traveler's Refrain - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXhR--g3f9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Traveller is a rather mysterious fellow with a lovely, well-trimmed beard. Awaking in a dream-like forest, with memories of past traumatic events clearly haunting him, our surprisingly trendy hero must journey on a quest of discovery, learning more about himself and this world he now inhabits in the process. </p>


<p>If this all sounds a little navel-gazing for you don’t worry, developer Red Essence Games smartly follow the show-don’t-tell model, getting out of the players’ way for the most part and keeping dialogue brief. As such, you pick up on the melancholic mindful elements in brief breaks between all the action, rather than being subsumed in sadness by never-ending dialogue.</p>
<p>Exploration and puzzling are where Traveller’s Refrain excels. Puzzles are basic but satisfying, demanding you find and light all the beacons, as an early example. It’s nothing you haven’t solved before, but these puzzles are well delivered. Even better, there are some fascinatingly fresh characters to encounter, many unlike anything I’ve encountered before in an RPG. </p>


<p>Visually distinctive, meeting new NPCs is the real drive behind your journeying. It also helps that everything looks sumptuous too, the hard-drawn cartoon aesthetic is brimming with details, and full of flair, creating a distinctive game world to explore. No mean feat when your game is set in a forest, likely the most done to death setting in all of video gamedom. That and ice levels, I guess.</p>
<p>Combat is reminiscent of a calmer version of Hades. Traveller can dodge dash with the best of them, nimbly avoiding flailing stone golems, sentient giant blobs of gloop and enormous plumes of flames. Armed with numerous close combat weapons over the course of this sixteen-hour adventure, the risk-reward of Traveller’s Refrain’s combat is clear, the player must get in close to dish out damage, before rapidly escaping enemy reprisal. </p>
<p>That’s not the only weapon at Traveller’s disposal, as he can also strum out a tune or two on his guitar. Basically, his wizard book, spells are summoned by flicks of the thumb stick in different directions. The player has to remember these, rather then being constantly prompted, though you can remind yourself of the inputs in Traveller’s song book. As such, there’s a delightful sense of risk as Traveller stands still to strum his guitar in the middle of a bunch of foes in a desperate attempt to heal himself. Get it wrong and it’s game over, get those inputs right, and you have a chance.</p>

<p>It’s exciting stuff, with hordes of enemies on-screen at anyone time. Though this isn’t without its problems, as Traveller may be fast and smooth in his movements, but the frame rate on Switch 1 certainly isn’t. In handheld mode, the game is almost unplayable at times. Even when there’s no onscreen fireworks, and Traveller is simply running back and forth, the frame rate chugs along like a particularly decrepit diesel train. Docked is better, of course, but the frame rate still struggles far more often than it should. Which is a real shame, as there’s some great Zelda-akin puzzling and exploration to be had here.</p>

<p>We go again with a Victory Road "sequel"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="75edb9732b962"><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75edb9732b962/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After many years of waiting, fans of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven</a> series were beginning to question if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> would ever see the light of day. Fortunately, Level-5 dug deep and was able to <em>finally</em> release the title on the Switch and Switch 2 in November last year.</p>
<p>It's already getting some updates <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/inazuma-eleven-victory-roads-second-major-free-update-kicks-off-this-month">with more to come</a>, but that's not all - with the Level-5 president and CEO Akihiro Hino (who has filled many roles at the company over the years) mentioning how he's already started writing the scenario for a "sequel" to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road. Yep, you read that correctly! We've even got a little detail about it.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hlksjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the rundown from the latest <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/level-5-president-akihiro-hino-has-begun-writing-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sequel">Ina-Dai broadcast via Gematsu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> “As for the sequel to Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, I have already started writing the scenario. As a ‘new Inazuma Eleven‘ that begins in the Reiwa era, I will do my best to deliver surprise and excitement to everyone once again. Please look forward to future announcements.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source also notes how "despite its recent release, Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road was announced in July 2016-during the Heisei era. The Reiwa era began on May 1, 2019".</p>
<p>It's worth noting how the Level-5 CEO previously mentioned how a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-final-trailers-ending-theme-song-music-video-and-latest-details">"potential sequel" would support</a> the "Player Bank" data from this current release. Of course, this "sequel" could still be years out, and it isn't exactly uncommon for developers within the games industry to jump straight into the next major title like this (or even have some sort of overlap between projects).</p>
<p>Still, we're <em>almost</em> exhausted just hearing this, as it took so long for Victory Road to arrive on the Switch - with multiple name changes and revisions along the way (with the latest one taking place in 2022), and the game also launching on the Switch 2 in the end.</p>
<p>For now, fans of the current release (<em>that's Victory Road</em>) can look forward to the second major free update, which will roll out on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>. You can find out a little more about this in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Following a studio closure last week</p>

<p>Here's the lengthy statement from Ubisoft, highlighting these studio restructuring measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ubisoft:</strong> Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.</p>
<p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p>
<p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p>
<p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development on The Division series is still expected to continue "as a matter of priority", and as noted, the "long-term direction" for both of these studios "remains unchanged".</p>
<p>The Malmö-based developer Massive also happens to be behind the Snowdrop engine, which powered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - a game released on Switch 2 last year.</p>
