                <p>Actor Jonathan Joss, who had voice-acted in a number of high-profile video games, was killed this week outside his home in an attack that his husband has alleged was a homophobic hate crime. He was 59 years old and leaves behind a legacy of roles across television, movies, and games.</p><p>Joss, who was of Comanche and White Mountain Apache descent, provided his voice for numerous games across his career. According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430885/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his IMDB page</a>, Joss had roles in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/" data-ref-id="5000-42031">Red Dead Redemption</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-walking-dead-michonne-a-telltale-miniseries/" data-ref-id="5000-438500">The Walking Dead: Michonne</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wasteland-3/" data-ref-id="5000-458193">Wasteland 3</a>. He also provided the voice for Robert Rainwater, a ripperdoc in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p>Outside of games, he was best known for his roles as indigenous characters in television comedies. Between 1997-2007, he played John Redcorn on King of the Hill; later, he appeared in several episodes of Parks and Recreation as casino magnate and tribal chief Ken Hotate.</p><p><i>Warning: sensitive and potentially disturbing details about Joss's death are discussed below</i>.</p><p>Joss was shot dead on June 1, 2025, at his house in San Antonio, TX. He had just married his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, on Valentine's Day earlier this year. After Joss's death, de Gonzales asserted that Joss was the victim of an anti-gay attack by a neighbor, who was described as yelling homophobic slurs at the couple. De Gonzales relayed how they returned to their home, which had previously burnt down, to check their mail, and they discovered remains of one of their dogs had been placed "in clear view." Expressing sadness and despair, the couple was confronted by the neighbor who opened fire, de Gonzales stated.</p><p>De Gonazles shared that the couple had faced homophobic harassment in their neighborhood for an extended period of time, and their reports to law enforcement had received no response. The San Antonio police <a href="https://abc7.com/post/jonathan-joss-killed-san-antonio-shooting-police-sayknown-character-king-hill-tulsa-parks-rec/16637058/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has responded</a> that it has not found any evidence to charge the suspect with a hate crime, and <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/cried-wolf-nothing-done-king-hill-actor-jonathan-joss-pitchfork-neighbors/273-2d9d7e2c-b5fd-42af-97aa-570f6a4a55e3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">neighbors have shared</a> that Joss and the suspect had a years-long feud that had gone unresolved.</p><p>Many actors who worked with Joss in the past have been outspoken in their sadness about his passing. Nick Offerman, who played Ron Swanson on Parks and Recreation, told <a href="https://people.com/nick-offerman-parks-and-recreation-cast-texting-about-jonathan-joss-death-all-day-11746985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">People Magazine</a> that the other actors from the sitcom extensively discussed and supported each other in the aftermath of the tragic events.</p>

                <p>Not much is known about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect game</a>, but producer Mike Gamble has now shared a small morsel of news regarding a feature that may return for the next entry: lens flare.</p><p>Posting on social media, Gamble used the "OK" emoji in response to a fan who said, "Mass Effect 5 better stick to tradition and have an excessive amount of lens flare."</p><p>The Mass Effect series is known for its creative and frequent use of lens flare, which is a filmmaking technique popularized by Hollywood directors like JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg. Obviously a video game does not use a physical camera like a Hollywood movie might, but games like Mass Effect are known to embrace lens flare for dramatic and stylistic effect.</p><p>Gamble's emoji response is not total confirmation of anything at all, but it's a strong suggestion that this one feature from past games may return. Given how silent BioWare has been about the game so far, fans are looking for any piece of news they can get their hands on.</p><p>With no expansions planned for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare's developers are now turning their attention to the next Mass Effect game. There is no word yet, however, on when the game may be released--so far, BioWare has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-with-mysterious-concept-art/1100-6508956/" data-ref-id="1100-6508956">only released a few teasers for it.</a></p><p>In addition to a new Mass Effect game, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">Mass Effect TV series is said to be in the works at Amazon MGM Studios</a>, the same outfit that's behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sydney-sweeney-starring-split-fiction-movie-from-deadpool-writers-gets-a-key-update/1100-6531988/" data-ref-id="1100-6531988">Split Fiction movie starring Sydney Sweeney.</a></p>

		<p>Raw Fury has revealed two new games at the MIX Summer Game Showcase, with the tower survival action of&nbsp;Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, and the RPG hack-and-slash adventuring of Regions of Ruin: Runegate.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of R’s.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P33pMKtwmLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road from Ludogram takes a little bit of tower defence, bullet heaven and survival crafting, chucks it all in the pot, and stews up a game where your city on wheels has to keep on rolling down the road while blasting away at swarming hordes of enemies. All the while, your player character can run around gathering resources, while various safe zones give an opportunity for greater resource hauls and major reworks and upgrades to your fortress city.</p>

<p>It’s an intriguing looking game that absolutely feeds off the gaming zeitgeist, but could definitely find a healthy following. The game is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2934220/Monsters_are_Coming_Rock__Road/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and you can <a href="https://forms.gle/cGjyaUxZgoQdMgVm6">sign up to the closed beta here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Regions of Ruin: Runegate from Gameclaw sends your dwarven character off on a side-scrolling hack ‘n’ slasher to explore the shattered realms that were once rules by your people and restore them to their former glory. There’s a nice low detail pixel art style here.</p>
<p>It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1375750/Regions_of_Ruin_Runegate/">wishlist on Steam today</a>.</p>
<p>Elsehwere, Raw Fury also had new trailers for Craftlings, to mark the release of a demo for the resource management strategy game – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">check it out here</a> – and there’s a new intro trailer for Esoteric Ebb, the rather unusual RPG where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/esoteric-ebb-to-be-published-by-raw-fury-become-a-cleric-in-this-crpg/">you play a cleric in a city</a> and have all your decisions affected by the roll of a D20.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Craftlings Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5JGBSo_T_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

Dbrand sent a sample to GameSpot, but since I don't have the console yet, I've only been able to hold it on its own. I can say that the ergonomics of the Joy-Con 2 grip attachments are excellent on their own; it feels natural to hold, and the build quality seems great.</p><p>Let's take a look at the Killswitch's features and the customization options you can pick from.

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killswitch Grip</a> adds ergonomic handles to the Switch 2's Joy-Con Controllers as well as an impact-resistant shell to protect the console from accidental drops. The Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch has a three-piece design that allows you to remove each Joy-Con 2 Controller without the need to remove the textured grips.</p><p>Like other Killswitch grips from Dbrand, the handles have a firm, rubberized feel. The handles are uniquely shaped with a contoured ridge to rest your middle fingers on. The low-profile case covers the back of the console without adding bulk to the top or sides; the casing extends up 2.5mm on the top and sides of the Switch 2. All of the ports are accessible with the case attached, and the console's built-in kickstand can still be used.</p><p>The only caveat here is that, unless you remove the Killswitch, you'll need to use an adapter to dock the console for TV mode. That said, Dbrand is bundling the custom dock adapter stand with the grip.</p><p>Pricing for the Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch starts at $60. At the base tier, you'll get the grip case, dock adapter, and a console skin.</p><p>Dbrand is offering discounts for the higher-priced configurations. The Travel package costs $79.85 (was $99.85) and comes with a front case that protects the Switch 2's display and buttons, sticks, and triggers while on the go. With the front cover attached, the Killswitch will fully replace a traditional carrying case. This tier also includes a 10-card game case that attaches to the inside of the travel cover, as well as textured thumbstick grips.</p><p>The Ultra package is now $99.80 (was $134.80) and includes everything from the Travel bundle, as well as two Dbrand Prism 2.0 tempered glass screen protectors with an auto-alignment application kit. You'll also get an extra game card holder.</p><p>Each of the add-on components is available to purchase separately, but the bundles offer better value. For instance, the travel cover with a game card holder is a $25 (was $30) add-on. Two screen protectors cost $30 (was $35). Meanwhile, the stick grips are $10, and an extra game card holder is $15--though you won't want that last one unless you get the travel cover.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505604" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505604"></a><figcaption>Dbrand Nintendo Switch 2 Killswitch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Week Restocks - Here's What We Know So Far</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-325-lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-box-set-is-only-146-for-a-limited-time/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set Is Only $146 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-collectible-book-sets-are-up-for-preorder-myths-legends-tales-of-middle-earth/1100-6531796/">Tolkien Collectible Book Sets Are Up For Preorder  - Myths, Legends, Tales Of Middle-earth</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two chief executives from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies, who worked on each Grand Theft Auto game since GTA III, have left the company just a week before the studio's first release, MindsEye, is set to launch.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Paul Bland quietly confirmed his departure with a quick update to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn page</a> that his time at Build A Rocket Boy concluded in June 2025, while chief legal officer Riley Graebner announced his departure with a short post on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn page</a>, saying "<em>After three and a half years my time at BARB has come to a close. I'm proud of what we've accomplished</em>."</p>
<p>That both of them have left just before MindsEye launches is more just the latest odd thing to be attached to MindsEye's story, than any actual reflection on what we should expect from the game on June 10.</p>
<p>But add that news to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1kt8ww4/previews_for_mindseye_by_former_rockstar_games/">less-than-enthusiastic previews </a>the game got, how little we know about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">game so close to release</a>, reports of the <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1929323838656950698">studio not giving out review codes</a>, negative reviews on the studio's internal structure from former employees on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a>, and the studio's co-chief executive officer claiming that any negative attention the game is a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">someone financially investing in a campaign to tarnish the studio's name</a>, and it all strikes as a bit more than odd.</p>
<p>Of course, the game could still come out next week and be amazing, but these departures are leading players in the game's official Discord server and on social media to show concern for its launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye and Everywhere have always sounded like two incredibly ambitious projects. It would be far more exciting if both games were spectacular, than if they failed to hit their mark. It's far too early to make a call on it yet, if for no other reason than none of us have played it, but it'll be interesting to see what June 10 holds either way.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Let's start this one with a definition: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is "one of those kinda games." By that I mean it's a four player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> title that doesn't really adhere to a particular genre, predominantly prioritising mechanics that allow you and some friends to get up to some shenanigans. Like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a>, or REPO, you know, one of those kinda games! Now we've got that out of the way, let me introduce you to Roadside Research, one of those kinda games, except this time you are an incredibly poorly disguised alien running a gas station in order to research humans. See what I mean?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It's a delectably silly concept, right down to said disguises literally just being bits of paper taped to the grey (and not grey) aliens' faces. In terms of the moment to moment gameplay, you'll be doing things a perfectly regular human working at a gas station would do: restock shelves, refuel customers' cars, "exchange goods for cash."

<p>
You'll need to cook and clean too, I'm assuming that second one is those hot dogs that roll on those spinning poles you're 100% sure have never been cleaned. Once you've finished a day's work, you can upgrade your gas station - again, a typical human thing to do - to help bring in more people the following day.
</p>
<p>
There's Men in Black-looking government officials to avoid too, for a bit of a threat. Overall it just looks like a silly good time, I'm not massively into online co-op games generally, but this recent trend of comedy online co-op games where there's often not really any violence is certainly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
Roadside Research doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3643170/Roadside_Research/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.

It also seems to carry some of its technical nuances, according to a new breakdown from the tech experts at Digital Foundry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-offers-no-technical-progression-and-doesnt-properly-support-ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> published an analysis of the tech details behind FromSoftware's latest, and while Nightreign remixes a lot of what Elden Ring was into something new, it sounds like the state of Nightreign's technology is fairly reminiscent of Elden Ring's.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is really nothing new to those familiar with FromSoftware's Elden Ring engine, and how it operates on consoles," wrote Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Foundry characterized the optimization for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles as "disappointing," as Nightreign continues to "often fall short of a target 60 frames per second while exploring." Additionally, the tech analyst noted there's no listed support for PlayStation 5 Pro, which bore out in tests, meaning the PS5 Pro is just running the base PS5 code with no additional modes or optimizations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-offers-no-technical-progression-and-doesnt-properly-support-ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> for the full numbers breakdown, as there's quite a bit to go through, but all of it is best summed-up by Morgan here: "Ultimately, using the quality mode makes no practical sense on any console."

Ciri and her horse Kelpie have particularly impressive movement and interactions with each other, NPCs, and the game world as they make their way through the mountains of Kovir to the bustling port town of Valdrest. At one point in the demo, CD Projekt upped the NPC count in the market scene to 300 individually animated characters. The showcase ended with a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The “standalone” tech demo was built to showcase Unreal Engine 5 features, CD Projekt said, and tools it’s using to develop the game’s open world. It is not gameplay footage, the developer stressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does the tech demo reflect what players can expect from The Witcher 4? CD Projekt said the visuals “reflect the direction we’re taking with The Witcher 4 — but it doesn’t fully represent the final game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt continued: “Production is still underway, and we have a great deal of work ahead. That said, our goal is ambitious: to create one of the most visually advanced role-playing games to date.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer also explained why it chose PS5 over a high-end PC for the tech demo: “Because optimizing for consoles early helps us future-proof performance across all platforms. Consoles come with tighter constraints, and meeting them pushes us to make smarter, more efficient tech choices — the kind that benefit every version of the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions about The Witcher 4 is target launch platforms. With this tech demo on PS5, the suggestion is it will be a cross-gen game that also runs on the next-gen consoles (PS6 and the next-gen Xbox). But if it’s due out on current-gen, does that also mean it will be available on the underpowered Xbox Series S?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembring that Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto VI is, as it stands, also due out on current-gen consoles including the Xbox Series S. So if GTA 6 is possible on Microsoft’s cheaper console, perhaps The Witcher 4 is, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest"><u>CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest</u></a>, so it may be some time before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Heroes of Valor, which takes inspiration from the shuttered Battlefield Heroes, is launching soon. The game enters early access on Steam beginning June 12, developer Fancy Cat has announced.</p><p>Heroes of Valor is described as a casual, arcade-style third-person shooter that aims to "try and bring back the gameplay and feeling" of Battlefield Heroes, but with its own twists and new additions. Heroes of Valor has two sides fight against each other in a stylized World War II environment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uerFZsMIdxo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uerFZsMIdxo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are three classes to choose from, four maps (at launch), lots of different guns, and land- and air-based vehicles. The game also allows players to customize their soldiers with standard-looking items, as well as more outlandish gear like a dinosaur head and corn cob pipe.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1126387243137908746/1126387758936637490/1379444639437684861" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on Discord</a>, the developers said they are working on a roadmap that will lay out "all the exciting features and updates" to come after launch. "Let's just say, there's a lot to look forward to," the developer said.</p><p>"We've not been idle the last few days and nor will we be the coming week leading up to the release. We've been reworking the UI, overhauled the sound design, improved hit and kill feedback, and polished a bunch of other areas--we want the game to look as fresh and shiny as possible when it drops," Fancy Cat said.</p><p>So far, the game is confirmed only for PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/678885/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-five-year-fortnite-ban<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> was missing from the iOS App Store for nearly five years before returning to the US last month. Apple kicked the game off in 2020 after Epic snuck in an in-app payment mechanism that violated App Store rules at the time. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney knew that the choice would result in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/fortnites-mastermind-goes-to-battle-with-apple-11619236807">“fireworks,”</a> but he initially expected the app would return quite a bit sooner.</p><p>“I had actually hoped that we would get an injunction against Apple blocking <em>Fortnite</em> and that we’d only be off for a few weeks,” Sweeney tells <em>The Verge</em>. “But the court process dragged out, and we were off for five years.”</p><p>Since its iOS return, <em>Fortnite</em> seems to be having a lot of success on the platform. As I write this, it’s the top free game in the App Store. There have been about 10 million downloads on iOS since it came back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">on May 20th</a>.</p><p>Sweeney and Saxs Persson, EVP of Fortnite ecosystem at Epic, wouldn’t share a specific number of net new players with the return of <em>Fortnite</em> on iOS, but they say that Epic generally sees two types of people coming to the title. There are the ones who play on the biggest and best device available to them at the time — like a TV at home and a phone on the go — and the ones who primarily play on their phones. Right now, primarily mobile players make up less than 50 percent of <em>Fortnite</em> players, Sweeney says. “All future growth of <em>Fortnite</em> will primarily be on mobile.”</p><p>“We’re really focused on making <em>Fortnite</em> better on mobile,” Persson says. Being back on iOS means that it’s “part of everybody’s life” at Epic and the team has a “real-world feel” for how good the app is on iOS and what it wants to change. For example, the game isn’t “fully optimized” for touch controls in battle royale or in creator-made experiences built with the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, he says. “The doors are open now, and we can actually go and every day make the game better.”</p><p>Epic’s new iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> also includes the option to pick from Epic’s payment system, which is now allowed thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">a major ruling</a> in Epic’s litigation against Apple, or Apple’s in-app purchase system when buying V-Bucks in the app. If you use its payments system, Epic offers 20 percent back in Epic Rewards, which can be used on other purchases in <em>Fortnite</em> or on the Epic Games Store. But more people are still using Apple’s system: roughly 60 percent of players have chosen Apple’s payment processing while 40 percent have chosen Epic’s, Sweeney says.</p><p>He expects that rate will improve “over time.” He points out that <em>Fortnite</em> players who have made purchases on PlayStation or Xbox may not have a payment method associated with their Epic account, but Apple requires a payment method for any in-app purchases so people may already be set up there. “As we get more players to associate payment methods with their Epic accounts, we’ll see a higher rate of adoption, and I would hope that it would be above 50 percent,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The multiplayer Grand Hub area has also been a welcome addition from the community, especially when it includes a performing singer who provides some fun bonuses. Here’s what you need to know about the Diva and what stat boosts she can provide.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h978435"><a id="1"></a>When does the Diva Sing?</h2><p>When visiting the Grand Hub, there is a chance you might catch a couple of songs at night. <strong>The Diva will randomly appear for two performances when the night cycle begins and ends</strong>. She appears on the large platform at the back end of the area. There is no way to manually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">change time</a></span> in the Grand Hub itself, so it all comes down to luck if you see her. Time in the Grand Hub runs separately from other locations, so assuming you don’t want to wait around 50 minutes for night to come again, I suggest tackling some hunts and returning in between to see if she’s there.</p><p>The good news is that the Diva always performs twice. After her first performance at sunset, she’ll remain in a praying position until it’s time for the second performance at sunrise. You’ll know it’s time for a performance if the BGM stops and multiple NPCs start moving towards the viewing area. A lot of players like to watch as well, so joining them when they gather is a good way to tell.</p><p>During the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-blossomdance-event-tickets-1851778319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-blossomdance-event-tickets-1851778319">Festival of Accord: Blossomdance event</a></span>, the Diva would put on another performance in the middle of the night cycle. Switching between seasonal songs and the typical one she performs made it feel like a fun, more organic mini-concert than just a reucurring NPC bit! Hopefully this will be the norm for future events as well.</p><h2 id="h978436"><a id="2"></a>What are the Diva Buffs?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-recommend-id="image://9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter sits at a table after having their stats boosted by the Diva’s performance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter sits at a table after having their stats boosted by the Diva’s performance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-recommend-id="image://9729150cea0bd9f375af15462c61134d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter sits at a table after having their stats boosted by the Diva’s performance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Being relatively close to the Diva when one of her performances ends will grant you a buff</strong>. That means you can earn two from her during most nights, or potentially three during an event. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t provide specifics besides a general message saying “Stats boosted thanks to the Diva’s voice of prayer and gratitude” once the song is over. <strong>What the Diva’s performance actually does is provide you with one out of five random buffs.</strong> Here is a list of what you can receive and the items that provide the same effects:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>+7 Attack (Mega Demondrug)</li><li>+15 Defense (Armorskin)</li><li>50+ Maximum Health (Well-done Steak)</li><li>+25 Maximum Stamina (Well-done Steak)</li><li>Increased HP Regen (Wild Jerky)</li></ul><p>Unless you know exactly what your stats were before or don’t have any current buffs from items or meals,<strong> the only way to generally tell what was boosted is if you see a new icon above your health bar</strong>. Any new buffs will be added on the right side. If you’re like me and don’t know all these little icons by heart, you can see what each means by heading to the Play Guide and selecting the Basic Controls tab. The first page of this sub-menu lists multiple status effects and which icons represent them.</p><p>The Diva’s buffs can stack with other buffs, but their limits are the same as their item equivalent. That means that while a Mega Demondrug won’t provide a stat boost with the Diva’s attack buff, a Mega Armorskin will completely override her defense buff.</p><p>Listening to a Diva performance won’t provide any game-breaking boosts for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">toughest hunts</a></span>, but every little bit helps. Just remember to look away before the end of her last performance. The shift between the night and morning phases is incredibly fast. While it’s cool for her to disappear with the rising sun, getting blinded by it isn’t as cool.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Why is that? Yabuki said that term is "just a little bit too ambiguously defined" for Nintendo to want to embrace it for Mario Kart World. Yabuki said Mario Kart World takes place in a "vast interconnected world," but "you still do need some traditional elements."</p><p>It may not be an open-world title by Nintendo's definition, but Mario Kart World is unlike any past game in the series due to the interconnected courses that allow players to drive from one race to the next. As for the free roam mode, players can freely explore the map by themselves or with friends. There are also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/" data-ref-id="1100-6530931">P Switch missions and collectibles to find across the map.</a></p><p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-is-a-bigger-hit-than-nintendo-imagined-may-not-be-a-cannibal/1100-6532020/" data-ref-id="1100-6532020">discussed the response to the fan-favorite Cow</a>, and we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-long-it-takes-to-drive-across-mario-kart-world-huge-map/1100-6532033/" data-ref-id="1100-6532033">found out how long it takes to drive across the entire map.</a> And if you're into lil weird guys, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/love-weird-lil-guys-mario-kart-world-is-the-game-for-you/1100-6532028/" data-ref-id="1100-6532028">Mario Kart World might be the game for you.</a></p><p>Mario Kart Word releases on June 5 as a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401"> launch title</a> for the Switch 2.

Since it was officially unveiled in April, it’s sounded like a very exciting shake-up of the popular but stale <em>Mario Kart </em>formula. Instead of individual tracks that you race on separately via different events,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct-switch-2-courses-modes-1851776553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct-switch-2-courses-modes-1851776553"><em>Mario Kart World </em>features an open map with no loading screens</a></span>. Each race track in this open-world playground is connected by roads and highways. Events are spread across the open map, which you can explore between races to find collectibles, missions, and more. And the map all of this takes place in sounds large. Very large. </p><p><em>Game File’</em>s Stephen Totilo got his hands on the Switch 2 early via an official press event.

So, how does that compare to other open-world games? </p><h2 id="h924449"><a id=""></a>Is <em>Mario Kart World </em>bigger than <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>?</h2><p>Well, to drive  across the whole map in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howbigisthemap.com/forza-horizon-5-drive-across-the-map-fast/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howbigisthemap.com/forza-horizon-5-drive-across-the-map-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, it takes around six minutes</a></span>, according to the wonderful YouTube account and website <em>How Big is the Map? </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howbigisthemap.com/gta-v-drive-across-the-map-fast/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howbigisthemap.com/gta-v-drive-across-the-map-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In <em>Grand Theft Auto 5,</em> it takes about eight minutes</a></span> to quickly drive across the map using roads and highways. Meanwhile, in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howbigisthemap.com/the-crew-motorfest-drive-across-the-map-fast/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howbigisthemap.com/the-crew-motorfest-drive-across-the-map-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft’s <em>The Crew Motorfest</em></a></span>, it takes about 16 minutes, driving as fast as possible, to cross its enormous map. </p><p>Now, keep in mind that we are comparing very different video games using vehicles that drive differently in worlds that contain different physics and were built at different scales. So don’t take this as scientific proof tha<em>t Mario Kart World</em> is in fact bigger than <em>Forza Horizon 5 or GTA 5.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, to me this just implies that, yes, the open world in Nintendo’s upcoming kart racer is big. It’s not a tiny little open world that you’ll explore in a few minutes, but something that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603046/mario-kart-world-impressions-gameplay-hands-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603046/mario-kart-world-impressions-gameplay-hands-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a preview from <em>Polygon</em></a></span>, is filled with hundreds of collectibles, missions, and side activities. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Though, according to <em>IGN, </em>the open-world mode</a></span> in the game doesn’t feel nearly as exciting or content-packed as that of <em>Horizon 5</em>. This is still a Nintendo-developed <em>Mario Kart</em> game and not some highly detailed simulation of a real world filled with multiple progression bars and seasons, like <em>Forza </em>or <em>The Crew</em>. Still, I’m very excited to get lost for hours exploring <em>Mario Kart World</em> when it arrives for Switch 2 on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">There will likely be some variation in driving times depending on the character and kart being used, as well as other factors. According to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, the default difficulty for which Mario Kart World was designed around is 150cc, so it's likely Game File and Digital Trends' timed drives were done at that speed. Like in normal races, players can also pick up coins that increase their speed while driving in Free Roam, which would decrease how long it takes to drive across the map.</p><p dir="ltr">As Nintendo's first $80 game of the modern era, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">Mario Kart World has a lot of work to do to justify its price</a>. Unlike previous Mario Kart games, players in Mario Kart World can take to the game's new Free Roam mode and travel across a massive map filled with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-tracks-courses/2900-6594/" data-ref-id="2900-6594">race courses</a>, side missions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">items</a>, and secrets to discover, all spread out across different biomes ranging from desert sands to snowy mountains.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Mario Kart's usual staples are included as well, however, including Grand Prix races across all of the game's courses and fan-favorite battle modes. It also includes the new Knockout Tour mode, where players continue to race from course to course, with the bottom handful of players continually eliminated from the race over time. The game originally started development as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-started-as-a-switch-game-but-switch-2-let-nintendo-realize-its-vision/1100-6531720/" data-ref-id="1100-6531720">Switch 1 game, but moving it to Switch 2 allowed Nintendo to realize its vision</a> for the ambitious follow-up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Kart World is one of the most-anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>, as well as Nintendo's biggest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">Switch 2-exclusive</a> launch title. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Nintendo Switch 2 goes on sale June 5, with some retailers getting restocked</a> on inventory ahead of launch.</p>

The agreement is being kicked-off with a single-player action-adventure title set somewhere in D&amp;D's expansive universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Stig and the team at Giant Skull are exactly the type of exceptionally talented creators we want to work with, and I’m so happy to be reuniting with him on this new project,” president of WOTC and digital gaming at Hasbro John Hight said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/world-of-warcraft-gm-john-hight-joins-hasbro-as-president-of-wizards-of-the-coast">left Blizzard</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after a 12-year tenure as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> general manager and SVP to take on the job at Hasbro in July 2024.

Many in the sizable fan following behind Baldur's Gate 3 had voiced concerns about the future of the game and its characters once Larian Studios stepped away from the property and any future additions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gog-lays-out-the-business-case-for-robust-game-preservation" target="_self" data-discover="true">GOG lays out the business case for robust game preservation</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="WOTC continues to place Baldur’s Gate 3 front and center without Larian">WOTC continues to place Baldur’s Gate 3 front and center without Larian</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The next slate of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games could have some sizable shoes to fill if WOTC hopes to see success similar to that of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

It's unavoidable when you're dealing with so much information that there will be a level of entropy. So, building systems to deal with that is very, very important. And so this is, I think, my biggest takeaway from it with how it all worked out for us."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/people-can-fly-blames-square-enix-for-latest-layoffs-and-project-cancelations" target="_self" data-discover="true">People Can Fly blames Square Enix for latest layoffs and project cancelations</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/the-witcher-4-gameplay-tech-demo-looks-impressive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During the State of Unreal conference today, CD Projekt RED showed a tech demo of The Witcher 4, and one of the most impressive things about is that this tech demo is running on a base PS5 at 60fps with raytracing. With this being a demo and the The Witcher 4 still in early development, this does not necessarily mean the final product will hit those same benchmarks.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 4 - UE 5.6 Tech Demo | State of Unreal 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJtF3wzPSrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The demo shows us a first look at Ciri in action as well as the region of Kovir, mentioned in previous games and in the books, but this is the first time players will be able to explore the region. We are also introduced to Ciri’s horse, Kelpie, her pure black horse who seems to have a bit more personality than Geralt’s Roach. The new Unreal Engine 5.6 update adds some new things to the experience too, including nanite foliage and character motion matching so horse riding, for example, comes across as much more lifelike.</p>
<p>The world of The Witcher 4 is much more responsive to Ciri’s actions as well. In one part she bumps into someone carrying a box of apples. The person drops some apples, a child and some pigs notice, and run up to gather the fallen apples. The clip goes on to show larger crowds gathered in a market square to watch a performance, all fitting into the game without sacrificing the 60 fps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> was revealed in December with confirmation that Ciri would take the role of the lead protagonist. All we know is that this is the start of a new era for The Witcher series and it is set in Kovir. We do not have any details yet as to what has taken Ciri to Kovir or which characters will be returning in this sequel. A release date has not been confirmed either.</p>

            <p>
How do you follow up a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/umurangi-generation">Umurangi Generation</a>? Maybe move from photography to videography, or go full shooter (which developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/origame-digital">Origame Digital</a> do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/umurangi-generation-dev-teases-new-horror-game-inspired-by-metal-gear-and-silent-hill">appear to be making too</a>, that one's just not had a full reveal yet). Perhaps instead of either of those things, you'll make a game about penguins, which, yeah, no more beating around the bush, that's exactly what they've done. Introducing: Penguin Colony, a narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game based on H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a> explains that this is a "radically different perspective" from the original piece of literature, in part because you play as a penguin who hears the "echoes of our narrator describing his plight." It's looking like it's somewhat level-based too, letting you waddle, slide, and swim around, discovering what happened "at your own pace." A pretty chill sounding time for a game with such heavy source material!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the narrator isn't having a great time, his brain experiencing time out of order after being called by "the old ones," leaving you, a simple penguin, the only one that can help him. Good stuff.
</p>
<p>
There even seems to be a suitable amount of gaminess to it too, as you can unlock different penguins for replays. They all have different abilities and challenges too, one of them being a baby penguin so you can fit in smaller gaps, but you can't swim.
</p>
<p>
Look, Umurangi Generation is up there as one of my games of the decade, so I'll be here day one whenever it does drop. Over on the Umurangi Generation Discord server, lead developer Veselok said that a trailer and demo will be turning up in the coming months, so my advice is to wishlist the game on Steam if you're interested in checking it out.

With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the <em>Demeo</em> <a title="Genres > Action [2,756 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Roleplaying System.”</p><p>narrative lead Mat Sernett added, “When <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> launched fifth edition back in 2014, the first <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,300 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for <em>Battlemarked</em> players to begin their journey. The first adventure in <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.”</p><div id="carousel_969425"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Resolution Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

		<p>Never Ends, a brand new tactical RPG, has been announced by developer Hypersect with the game set to be released for PC via Steam, and PlayStation consoles later this year. The game has developers with some major experience under their belts, including designer Masayoshi Nishimura who has worked on Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy, director Ryan Juckett who was the lead sandbox level designer for Destiny, and muscian Doseone who has worked on Enter The Gungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Never's End | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkBd9ygZg8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Our collective influences from tactical RPGs like&nbsp;Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tactics Ogre&nbsp;came together to spark a grander idea,”</em> said Ryan Juckett, founder of Hypersect. <em>“Never’s End&nbsp;fleshes out turn-based tactics combat with reactive systems empowering players to co-author the story and make it their own, which is a feeling we loved in&nbsp;Divinity: Original Sin 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Together with Nishimura-san, Doseone, and&nbsp;you, we’re excited to finally get to show you all just how memorable this forgotten world can be.”</em></p>
<p>The story of Never Ends puts players in the role of an immortal warrior who is defending the last human settlement, as the rest of the world has succumbed to a force known as the Never. Players will be able to wield elements like fire and water, and put together a team of warriors to fight enemies in tactical turn based battles. As progress is made, players can restore the world of Never Ends by reviving locations, towns, businesses, and trade routes. Doing so will give access to new party members who can help in the fight.</p>

<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Never Ends.</p>
