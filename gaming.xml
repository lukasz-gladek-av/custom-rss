            <p>
Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a "quantum computer", splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home. 
</p>
<p>
The result is a rolling space base full of alternate, vat-grown Jans, from bitter repairman Jans to aloof scientist Jans and all the many glittering gradations of Jan that lurk betwixt. The Jans have a hard time getting along, initially. The shared existential horror of everybody being a version of everybody else aside, they all represent each other’s roads-not-taken, a premise that leaves ample room for resentment, envy and contempt. But jolly along they must, in order to operate the aforesaid rolling space station and escape the apocalyptic planet they’re stranded on. Assuming you make the right dialogue decisions as Jan Prime, and ensure each Jan’s material needs are met while upgrading and expanding the station, this practical objective will produce a growing closeness, punctuated by swirly notifications about changes of emotional state, which feels like one big, baroque metaphor for a guy making peace with his own past and warring urges. 
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/5_DLKABC0.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It’s both a fun narrative setup and the makings of a production nightmare, to say nothing of the presumably enormous strain placed upon the vocal chords and mental coherence of Jan’s sole voice actor, Alex Jordan. There’s the intricacy of each Jan’s personality in itself, and then there’s the problem of writing up all their interactions, and how they might develop in response to each other - depending on which Jans the player decides to spawn in whatever order. 11 bit have managed this potential for overwhelming complexity by, firstly, only giving you charge of one Jan, the primary Jan who gets to sleep in the captain’s bedroom at the base’s heart, and secondly, by firmly resisting the temptation to do a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eD-dHzGmS4">Flanders family reunion</a> and conjure up a Jan for every genre or season. There are, as far as I can tell, no Janpunks, Cowboy Jans, Jan 3000 BC’s or other Expanded Janiverse misadventures in The Alters. 11 bit has limited the population carefully to keep the quality up and suit the particular narrative dilemmas they want to explore.
</p>
<p>
“We had the idea of what are the most important problems or maybe decisions that players can relate to, and built upon that was the decision of how many Alters do we want to have,” lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me. “We want to have enough Alters to talk about all those things, but not too many, so we wouldn't drown in in writing the shallow stories. So there are more Alters hidden [in the game] then you can find in one playthrough, but just enough for us to get deep into each type of decision and where they came from - what type of person will he become? What will he decide to believe in? How does it work for him in his life, for the people around him?”
</p>
<p>
Looking beyond the tension between multiversal storytelling and project management, the idea of duplicating somebody by reaching into their backstory and yanking levers has a certain amount of overlap with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">current discussions about generative AI</a> and its questionably legal and often intrusive reuse of data shared online. Jan is not the architect of the quantum computer – he is shocked to discover that it is loaded with his entire life history, with one character noting that he probably should have read the small print on his mining contract. 11 bit had a booth at their Alters hands-on event where journos could chat to AI-generated characters. When I asked Wlosek about this, however, he insisted that The Alters isn’t designed to offer “food for thought” on AI.
</p>
<p>
“There was a time when we were discussing the idea of an AI being part of the quantum computer - maybe creating a character out of this machine,” he said. “But we wanted to focus on one topic at a time. And we didn't want to, you know, put the spotlight on too many different aspects of sci-fi.” To be clear, the quantum computer AI would have been a written character, not a piece of text-generating software. “I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public,” Wlosek added. “Personally, of course, I'm very interested in how things are going in this area. This is something that probably everyone who knows what's going on is interested in, and will be watching closely, but it’s not in this game.”
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Among the broader strokes that differentiate one Jan from another is romantic history. Jan Prime has signed up for offworld mining duty partly because he’s broken up with his wife, who plays an active role nonetheless in the plot. One of the other Jans is from a Janiverse where his wife has died, and is naturally frantic to discover that she’s still alive in Jan Prime’s continuity. The topic of lovelives, together with the conspicuously cramped confines of the rolling space base and the emphasis on building a rapport with other Jans, got me wondering just how far Jan’s evident enormous self-absorption might go. Is it possible for Jans to romance other Jans? And with a view to getting ahead of the Rule34 crowd - can they bone?
</p>
<p>
“No they don’t,” Wlosek said, exactly 31 seconds later. “But it’s not like this topic is totally removed. The whole game or is about thinking about your decisions, about your life, going back to those decisions, if they were good or wrong, and dwelling on them, and maybe we want to show this from very different angles, to give the player the space to think about it. And in order to do that, we had to take a look at every aspect of life, so I guess that would be my general answer! It's not like having sex with the other Alters or anything like that, but the romantic relations of a couple of the Alters are very important, and not all of them are with women.”

			<p>Dragon Age Dreadwolf, the highly-anticipated next entry in the Dragon Age series, is said to be fully revealed later this week.</p>
<p>That's what Insider-Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-we-see-dragon-age-dreadwolf-at-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> based on insider reports. Although the outlet isn't entirely sure during which planned showcase Bioware's title will be revealed, it's likely that it will happen during Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest event later this week. "According to insider reports, which we’re working to corroborate, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will receive a full reveal this week, likely during Summer Game Fest", the outlet writes. "Whether it happens during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Xbox Games Showcase, or elsewhere, however, remains to be seen."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> back in March of this year, the team behind Dreadwolf as well as publisher EA seemingly have been expressing to be pretty confident that the game will launch later this year, and that a reveal during the summer is likely. "<em>I suspect [Dragon Age] will probably pop up this summer", </em>Journalist Jeff Grubb wrote back in March<em>. "I don't know exactly when it will be shown is the real answer. I assume it will be shown sometime this summer, could happen at any time though. It will be released this year, last I heard. They're pretty confident about that. Doesn't mean it's a guarantee, could slip, but right now, internally, they expect to release it later this year.”</em></p>
<p>Earlier this month, Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also said</a> that the development team behind Dreadwolf is really happy with how the game has turned out. "<em>And they should have all of the details for that thing because everyone seems really happy with that game; they're pretty pleased with how it turned out", </em>Grubb said earlier this month<em>. "The plan is to launch that this calendar year, so not EA's fiscal year, not before March 2025 or anything like that, this year. And I don't think you're going to have to wait too long after this thing gets announced to play it."</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age Dreadwolf is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. We'll update you as soon as more information about the title comes in.</p>

<p>XDefiant’s first season update will reportedly introduce a Capture the Flag mode to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/xdefiant-leaker-claims-capture-the-flag-mode-will-arrive-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, datamined information has revealed some interesting details for XDefiant’s Season 1 update. Through a now-deleted post by X user <a href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796702849792967131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rogue TX</a>, the dataminer revealed that Ubisoft will introduce a new game mode in its Season 1 update.</p><p>The game mode in question is Capture the Flag, which we have seen primarily in games like Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, Halo Infinite, Overwatch, and more as a staple gamemode. Of course, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it does not come from an official source, but as the account has seemingly been copyright stricken by Ubisoft, it does have some credibility. </p></div>

<div><p>Capture the Flag is a game mode that most multiplayer shooter veterans are well-versed with. The mode is simple, where players aim to capture the enemy team’s flag and bring it back to their base to score a point. The team with the most points at the end of the match or round wins the game – Simple!</p><p>At the moment, XDefiant has five game modes to explore: Occupy, Domination, Zone Control, Escort, and Hotshot. Adding Capture the Flag as a six-game mode will surely be a worthy addition to the game and could be a great addition to its future competitive scene.</p></div>



<p>Xdefiant is a free-to-play, first-person, multiplayer shooter by Ubisoft that has taken the world by storm. The game has been out for a little over two weeks now and has managed to gather more than 8 million unique players in that time. The game recently released its Y1S0.2 patch, which included fixes for Social features and other miscellaneous issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a Capture the Flag mode in Xdefiant? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">New weapons always dominate the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> meta at launch, but players have already had enough of Season 4’s Kar98k sniper rifle, and are begging Sledgehammer to nerf it. </p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">Season 4 has already seen <em>CoD</em> fans complain about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-players-are-sick-of-old-guns-getting-nerfed-into-the-ground-every-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sledgehammer making old guns useless</a>, but the other side of that coin is that when they drop a new weapon, it’s often so powerful that it becomes the game’s most picked gun and is far too powerful. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">That’s the opinion that many have of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> right now, with riversub calling the weapon “a menace” and “the definition of overpowered” on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/1d8eow2/kar98_needs_a_nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>A welcome return. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">“Yep, one-tap weapons should be high risk, high reward, but nearly all of them in this game aren’t,” agreed Grand-Article4214. “There are barely any risks for snipers, especially since they aren’t balanced to 150 health compared to every other gun in the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">Icy-Computer7556 explained that they feel the gun has “ridiculous aim assist,” stating: “Anything with one-shot potential close or far should instantly be aim assist free. They did that in previous <em>CoD</em>s and it worked well. Skilled players kept sniping and sh*tters gave up because they realized they didn’t have the skill to just bloop everyone every second. I’m not saying I’m a good sniper, but the fact that it can slow down or pull on a gun like that? It’s f**king crazy.”</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">For some though, the idea of nerfing the Kar98k is pointless because something else will take its place, with conanwongmkii writing: “It’s either the Kar98k, the Wardens, or the MORS sniper. Pick your poison, you can’t escape it.”</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="false">Personally, I find the Kar98k to be unbelievable in other people’s hands, but in mine it feels like I get nothing but hitmarkers. I’ve never been a great sniper though, so it may be my fault. Still, getting one-shot killed over and over again by people running the Kar98k is infuriating, and I’d love to see some balancing changes too.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's OTK Games Expo, South Korean developer IRONMACE <a href="https://www.darkanddarker.com/news/54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the availability of a free-to-play option for Dark and Darker.</p>
<p>Free-to-play accounts have certain limitations, as you would expected. Players taking advantage of the free access will only get to create one character and only be able to enter Normal modes, although there are no limitations regarding maps. The goal is obviously to get more players into Dark and Darker while also providing the option to upgrade later to 'Legendary' status. All players who purchased the Standard and Founders Edition will be automatically upgraded to Legendary Status, by the way, and premium players will also have exclusive access to the Shared Stash between their characters.</p>
<p>That's not all the news IRONMACE shared yesterday. The studio also discussed some of the changes coming with the upcoming season, which starts in a few days.</p>
<p><em>One of the big changes is the reduction in the power gap for items. We have now removed all ‘Junk’ and unnamed ‘Unique’ items. Named ‘Unique’ grade weapons still appear but they now share the same stats and rolls as their ‘Legendary’ counterpart with only difference being the addition of their unique passive. We have also reduced the damage and armor rating values for all weapons and equipment at the upper end to make them less overbearing. We have removed random modifiers that were too valuable such as the +all attribute rolls and have lowered and tightened the gap for the remaining rolls. We have also diminished the movement speed penalty gap on armors to reduce the heavy reliance on move speed. Finally, we have added a flat HP boost to all classes to slightly improve survivability in battles. Please note that many of the perks, skills spells, and class balance remain to be tuned with this new philosophy in mind and will be adjusted in the future.</em></p>

<p>Dark and Darker, you'll remember, is the fantasy extraction game that first debuted on Steam in early 2023. It enjoyed great success for a while, but NEXON quickly filed a DMCA and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-and-darker-removed-from-steam-due-to-dmca-takedown-issued-by-nexon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had it removed from the store,</a> alleging that IRONMACE employees developed the game using 'trade secrets' from NEXON's unreleased P3 project. The lawsuit in American court was eventually dismissed last year, and Dark and Darker will soon launch <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dark-and-darker-qa-c1e629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, but there's no confirmation regarding a return to Steam.</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>A new development studio has launched in Barcelona, led by games veteran David Polfeldt.</p>
<p>Called Bespoke Pixel, the studio is currently in the process of assembling its core team, and has raised $25 million in funding as reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/david-polfeldt-opens-bespoke-pixel-game-studio-in-barcelona/">GamesBeat</a>.</p>
<p>Polfeldt previously worked at Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment for 17 years in various leadership roles, the longest serving as managing director from 2008 to 2021.</p>
<p>He was involved with franchises including The Division, Avatar, Far Cry 3, and Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p>
<p>Polfeldt left Massive in 2022 to work as a strategic advisor for PlayerUnknown and Disney before co-founding Bespoke Pixel.</p>
<p>"The opening of Bespoke Pixel in Barcelona reflects our confidence in the local gaming industry, as well as the city's supportive infrastructure" said Polfeldt. "As a newcomer, we hope to add a new dimension to Barcelona's incredibly rich cultural heritage."</p>
<p>He added: "We aim to create original intellectual property focused on refined and well-crafted gameplay. We are forming a small and agile team, initially dedicated to prototype development. We will harness the extensive experience of the core team to deliver top-tier gaming experiences."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-early-access-debut-set-for-late-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two and a half years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/notorious-studios-founded-by-ex-wow-devs-wants-to-build-the-next-chapter-of-core-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project's announcement</a>, Notorious Studios unveiled its debut game, Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery, during yesterday's OTK Games Expo.</p>
<p>The studio was founded by several former members of the World of Warcraft team. However, this is no MMO. Instead, it sounds more like an extraction action RPG set in a fantasy world. In the official FAQ listed on the game's website, Notorious Studios explained:</p>
<p><em>The vision of Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery is to be the ultimate world PvPvE game. Players can embark on adventures either solo or with up to two other friends in open-world maps for up to 24 players. The objective is to kill players and monsters, loot, and get back safely to town.</em></p>
<p><em>Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery features full loot PvP, PvE encounters, RPG fantasy classes, and modern third-person action-based combat. The game is session-based with persistent progression. Although it has some elements commonly found in MMORPGs, like crafting, character customization, classes, and open world maps, we do not classify our game as an MMO. </em></p>
<p><iframe title="Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery Official Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmsQWcaw12A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery will debut in late 2024 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam Early Access</a>, where it is expected to stay for at least twelve months. The Steam page also delves a bit more into the gameplay features.</p>
<p>Each class will have its own way of interacting with the environment. For example, Warriors can hurl boulders and charge through walls, whereas Priests are able to levitate.</p>
<p>In the safety of the town, players will need to improve their standing with vendors to unlock the best crafting options or just to get the NPCs to lower their prices. The players' homes can also be improved with better furnishings, which will have some kind of positive impact (likely a buff) on the characters. However, the developers also said major updates would sometimes reset progression, providing the community with a 'fresh start'.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/05/canyon-doublebee-gtws-2-gaming-earbuds-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/canyon-doublebee-gtws-2-gaming-earbuds-review.889965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/05/canyon-doublebee-gtws-2-gaming-earbuds-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s start with the positives shall we? It’s not often that I have to launch straight into finding the best possible things to say due to the less than positive ones I’m going to be saying later, but in the case of the Doublebee GTWS-2, a gaming-focussed pair of wireless earbuds, it’s sadly unavoidable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gaming Headset DoubleBee GTWS-2 by Canyon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlJrqYTTNes?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Doublebee gets its name thanks to its Bumblebee-styled visuals. Now, we’re talking Transformers Camaro more than fuzzy honey-making insectoids, so the case for the GTWS-2 looks like the bonnet of Michael Bay’s favourite yellow and black car. It’s certainly eye-catching, and for a certain type of gamer, it might prove irresistible.</p>


<p>Things become even more interesting when you open the case up via two gull-wing door-styled sections, revealing the earbuds, two glowing RGB strips and the case’s charge level via a numeric LCD display. I especially liked the charge indicator, as it lets you know exactly how much juice is left in the case before you have to charge it up, rather than the vague, non-existent indicators you’ll find elsewhere. You get around 4 hours of playback per full charge, which is solid, if a little on the short side, while the case bumps that up to 37 hours before you have to reach for the USB-C charging cable.</p>
<p>The earbuds carry on the yellow and black theme, with an RGB indicator built into each side to indicate battery levels and connection. They’re smooth and wholly formed out of plastic, much like early Airpods, but without silicon or foam earbud tips you can’t get a perfect, or gentle, seal. However, they’re also rock solid, and won’t discolour or break as they age.</p>


<p>There are onboard touch controls, allowing you to pause and play, move back and forth through audio tracks, and make incremental volume changes via a triple press on either earbud. It’s a simple enough system, and the responsiveness is good, though the triple press for volume changes can become exhausting if you’re making big alterations.</p>
<p>The Canyon Doublebee GTWS-2 is budget-focussed, and at its sub-£30 price point there are very few gaming earbuds at this price, especially ones that can match the build quality and aesthetics. Unfortunately, that’s where the positives stop.</p>
<p>The audio from the Doublebee GTWS-2 is fatally flawed, with the worst bass response I’ve heard from any headset or earbud I’ve reviewed in the past five years. There’s no control, and anything remotely close to being a bottom-end tone clips and squelches in a frankly unlistenable manner. I was so surprised to experience this that I requested a second review unit, thinking that the original was broken, but as it turns out, this is how the earbuds are being shipped.</p>

<p>There is a very specific use case for the Doublebee, and that’s in an FPS or battle royale where you’re focussing on the top-end details of footsteps and gunfire to help locate your foes. It works well enough here – I played a few rounds of Overwatch 2 and the location of enemies was clear enough, but then the music between rounds sounded truly awful, bringing the experience crashing back down.</p>
<p>In this day and age, where audio performance from budget headsets is getting closer and closer to that offered by the bigger manufacturers, I simply don’t understand what’s gone wrong during the Doublebee GTWS-2’s audio design and testing. It’s a real shame when clear effort has been put into various other aspects of its construction.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Huge Hogwarts Legacy Update Explained in Video Form]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-update-video/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/huge-hogwarts-legacy-update-explained-in-video-form.889962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-update-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>This summer, a major update is being released on all platforms for Hogwarts Legacy, one of the best-selling games of 2023. The shining gem at the heart of the update is the new photo mode, which will allow players to capture their Wizarding World-based adventures like never before. It’s an advanced offering, boasting a range of filters, character poses, and the ability to change the time of day and even the season, impacting the weather and scenery in the shot.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-for-hogwarts">More for Hogwarts</h2>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy proved to be a stellar title when it was released in February 2023. It took over social and streaming platforms with ease and topped charts worldwide, before doing it all over again when it landed on further platforms as the year unravelled. In Hogwarts Legacy, players undertake a vast adventure that takes them in and around Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the surrounding map – the Forbidden Forest, for instance, is widely explorable.</p>



<p>Here’s the video-based breakdown of this update:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy - Summer Update Explainer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1n0iSq1byw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On June 6, this super-sized update will be released on all platforms, with WB Games promoting a social media campaign encouraging users to share their screenshots taken in photomode with the hashtag #CaptureTheUnwritten.</p>



<p>Fans are still asking for plenty of features to be added to Hogwarts Legacy, and more still are begging WB Games to produce some kind of DLC for the game, but at present, there’s no indication that’s on the cards. </p>

<p>Behaviour Interactive has revealed that up to 95 employees will be laid off amid ‘strategic changes’ to the company’s operating model. This news comes mere months after a wave of redundancies saw 40 workers lose their jobs at the firm. In a press release, Behaviour’s representatives confirmed that a driving reason for these layoffs is the ‘unprecedented competition’ running through the gaming industry at present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beginning-the-next-phase">Beginning the Next Phase</h2>



<p>A statement published to recognise the layoffs was written by Behaviour Interactive:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Within this challenging context, Behaviour has renewed its focus on its historical strengths. These include the company’s leading position in horror gaming, its production expertise, and its thirty-year history of providing exceptional service to its development partners.</p>



<p>To pursue this clarified vision, Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources. As a result of these changes, the company will reduce its team by up to 95 employees, 70 of whom are based in Montreal.</p>



<p>While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the second time in as many days that a Montreal-based studio has been hit with this kind of action. On June 3, Avalanche Studios (Just Cause) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-layoffs-and-studio-closures/">closing a studio in Montreal</a>, leading to the laying off of employees at the office. </p>



<p>It was further confirmed that Dead by Daylight’s live-service development won’t be impacted by these layoffs, and that ongoing projects remain ‘business as usual’. That means that the spin-off title, The Casting of Frank Stone, won’t be affected by this round of redundancies.</p>

<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new deep-dive into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, showcasing how the grand and regal reveal was pieced together at the start of 2024. In April, Warhorse lifted the lid on KCD2, unveiling an ambitious follow-on from the 2018 title that turned heads after surfacing as a Kickstarter-backed product built by a small but passionate team.</p>



<p>This year’s reveal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 showed just how far things have progressed. With a cinematic and stunning video, Warhorse Studios filled the hearts of fans of the franchise with a fresh sense of anticipation for this upcoming open-world RPG title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kcd-bts">KCD BTS</h2>



<p>In the new making-of video, Warhorse’s marketing team explores the unique reveal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, covering everything from the seeds of the project to the ultimate delivery. It’s a telling walkthrough of the magic that went into this stellar reveal, which transcended being ‘just a new trailer’ and lodged itself firmly in the memory of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Here’s the new making-of video:</p>

<p>Recently, I had the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">opportunity to catch up with Tom McKay</a>, the actor behind Henry of Skalitz, the main character in 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance <strong>and </strong>the frontman for the follow-up title, which is due to be released later this year.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 follows directly from the end of the first title, plunging players into an expansive and detailed map and leaving them to their own devices. With a multi-angled story, survival mechanics, thousands of dialogue options, and some of the most intense combat in gaming history, Kingdom Come presents the ultimate medieval adventure for any player. </p>

<p>In a new trailer, Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded was revealed as being a Meta Quest 3-exclusive title, dropping this summer and being dubbed an ‘unparalleled, untethered, and unrivalled VR experience.’ It has been pieced together by XR Games, a UK-based studio that has worked on the likes of Zombie Army VR and Jurassic World Aftermath.</p>



<p>However, fans of the franchise were quick to criticise the announcement, as shown in the comments section under the freshly posted trailer. There are widespread issues with the PC version of Hitman 3 VR that gamers have been reporting for some time, and the consensus is that Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded should have also been ported to PSVR2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-47">Becoming 47</h2>



<p>Following the release of the new trailer for Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, pre-orders for the game went live with a limited-time discount of 10% on the listed price. According to XR Games, several key improvements have been made to Hitman 3 VR to warrant this ‘Reloaded’ tag:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of dual-wielding</li>



<li>Fresh cel-shaded art style</li>



<li>Overhauled UI</li>



<li>Improved movement mechanics</li>



<li>Visual enhancements</li>



<li>Refined gameplay mechanics</li>
</ul>



<p>Since being released a few years back, the original VR version of Hitman 3 has been plagued with a series of issues. Despite that, the game was nominated for awards – and won VR Game of the Year at the Steam Awards in 2022. Online, there’s a whole different sentiment surrounding the game, and the review rating on Steam currently sits at ‘Mostly Negative’.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the new Reloaded version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HITMAN 3 VR: Reloaded - Announcement trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCpv3XuxTL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The hope would have been that the Reloaded edition could have placated the masses, but now that it has been locked to Meta Quest 3, more consumers than ever are feeling pushed out of the circle. </p>

		<p>The <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> “free” games for June 2024 are now available to add to your digital library. Sony’s latest offering includes a trio of titles that come with your PS Plus subscription, including celebrated retro brawler, Streets of Rage 4.</p>
<p><iframe title="Streets of Rage 4 - Launch Trailer | PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDXY1WRef0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For those who subscribe to the most expensive Premium tier of PlayStation Plus, there will be more games on the way later this month, including a handful of highly-anticipated PS2 classics and PSVR titles. This is all part of Sony’s Days of Play 2024 event, in which PlayStation fans can snag themselves a range of discounts and freebies, as well as reduced priced PS Plus subscriptions.</p>
<p>To access any of the PlayStation Plus games for June 2024, you simply need to head over to the PlayStation Store (or PS Plus) section of your console home menu to find them. Here, you can either download them directly, or add them to your library for later. We always recommend adding any games to your library, even if you don’t fancy playing them at the moment – if you don’t, you’ll lose access when the next rotation of “free” games arrives next month!</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus June 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three&nbsp;games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 4th June.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Streets of Rage 4 is a modern classic, for side-scrolling beat ’em up fans. Published by DotEmu, whose reputation for retro revivals was already well established, it was another big success story. In our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">9/10 Streets of Rage 4 review</a>, Aran said, “The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.</p>
<p>The same can’t really be said of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/07/aew-fight-forever-review/">AEW Fight Forever</a>, which thoroughly disappointed our resident wrestling head, Ade. So let’s move right along.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake was a solid if unremarkable new platformer based on the incredibly popular cartoon series. “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a decent 3D platformer filled with all the SpongeBob humour you’d expect, but it feels like a step back when compared to the far more imaginative Battle for Bikini Bottom: Reheydrated,” Steve said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review/">in our review</a>.</p>

<p><em>What do you think of this month’s games, and what are your predictions for July’s game selection?</em></p>

<p data-characters="81" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">EA Sports has announced an <em>EA FC 24</em> maintenance, which will take place on June 5.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">This maintenance comes at a time when the Ultimate TOTS promo is still active in the Ultimate Team mode. However, EA Sports has some big plans for the upcoming weeks, and this server update might be in preparation for that. Among other possible content going live in the future, a separate Euro 2024 tournament is also expected by the fans. But before that, the community will have to bear with the upcoming update.</p>
 <h2 id="h-when-will-the-ea-fc-24-maintenance-june-5-begin" data-injectable="false">When will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) begin?</h2> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">EA Sports has officially announced details of the upcoming maintenance on the game’s official X account. According to that post, the servers will be taken down at <strong>8 a.m. UTC/1 a.m. PDT/4 a.m. ET</strong>, and matchmaking across all game modes will be stopped 30 minutes prior to that.</p> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">This maintenance will apply to the game across all platforms. However, only <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> will be impacted by this update, so those of you still playing older releases like <em>FIFA 23</em> can continue to play without any worry.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have a maintenance coming up on June 5, 08:00 to 14:00 UTC.

As per the available schedule, June 5’s maintenance will end at <strong>2 p.m. UTC/7 a.m.PDT/10 a.m. ET</strong>. If there are no more delays, the servers will be down for approximately six hours. This is certainly one of the longer server maintenances in recent times.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">While the maintenance is live, players won’t be able to access game modes like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-91-tots-player-pick-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>, which rely on online matchmaking. Career Mode will remain a playable option, as there’s no need for the internet to conduct matches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-clorinde-builds-in-genshin-impact/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-clorinde-builds-in-genshin-impact<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="204" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Clorinde is a 5-star Electro DPS character in <em>Genshin Impact</em> with unique Bond of Life mechanics. Once you’ve learned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/?p=528421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to play Clorinde</a>, here are the best weapons and artifacts to maximize her damage.</p> <h2 id="h-clorinde-s-best-weapons-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Clorinde’s best weapons in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-absolution" data-injectable="false">Absolution</h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Absolution is Clorinde’s best weapon. As her signature 5-star Sword, its passive is tailor-made for her Bond of Life mechanics, and Clorinde should have no trouble keeping uptime on its buff. Still, the difference in damage between Absolution and the other 5-stars below is not wide enough to justify gambling on the weapon banner.</p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-light-of-foliar-incision-haran-geppaku-futsu" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision / Haran Geppaku Futsu</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision and Haran Heppaku Futsu are good 5-star options if you don’t have Absolution. Their damage comes fairly close to her signature, since their passives are generally useful for Clorinde.</p> <h3 id="h-primordial-jade-cutter-uraku-misugiri" data-injectable="false">Primordial Jade Cutter / Uraku Misugiri</h3> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">PJC and Uraku Misugiri don’t perform quite as well as the options above, but they’re still quite strong on Clorinde. Other 5-star Swords like Splendor of Tranquil Waters or Mistsplitter Reforged will also work fine if you happen to have them.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-black-sword-finale-of-the-deep" data-injectable="false">The Black Sword / Finale of the Deep</h3> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Black Sword and Finale of the Deep are the 4-star options for Clorinde. With Refinements, Black Sword can be competitive with the 5-stars above. Finale of the Deep is the Fontaine craftable weapon, and I recommend Refining it if possible.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-sets-for-clorinde-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Artifact sets for Clorinde in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-4pc-fragment-of-harmonic-whimsy" data-injectable="false">4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Since Clorinde has Bond of Life built into her kit, she synergizes well with 4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy. If you’re farming from scratch, though, you may want to consider the sets below. They’re almost as good in the right circumstances, and they may be more efficient to farm.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Genshin Impact on Twitter</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-4pc-thundering-fury" data-injectable="false">4pc Thundering Fury</h3> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">4pc Thundering Fury can reduce Clorinde’s Skill cooldown, possibly allowing for shorter or more flexible rotations. Whether this is worth it really depends on your team. At best, Thundering Fury performs similarly to Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy. At worst, if you don’t use the reduced Skill cooldown, it’s roughly on par with Gladiator’s Finale.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4pc-gladiator-s-finale" data-injectable="false">4pc Gladiator’s Finale</h3> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">If neither of the above sets appeal to you, 4pc Gladiator’s Finale is a good alternative. While its damage potential is not as high, it’s very consistent, and you don’t need to worry about optimizing Clorinde’s team to make good use of her build.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-stats-to-prioritize-for-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Artifact stats to prioritize for Clorinde</h2> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sands</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Goblet</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Circlet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">ATK<br>Elemental Mastery</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG</td><td data-align="center">CRIT Rate/DMG</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">Clorinde does not rely on her Burst every rotation, so don’t worry about her Energy Recharge. Focus on offensive stats instead, like CRIT DMG, CRIT Rate, ATK, and Elemental Mastery.</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Pick a CRIT circlet that brings your CRIT Rate:CRIT DMG ratio closer to 1:2. This will primarily be determined by your weapon; if using a CRIT Rate weapon, try to use a CRIT DMG circlet and vice versa.</p>

<p data-characters="401" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Some players are realizing,&nbsp;as they delve into&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;campaign in&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>,&nbsp;that&nbsp;they&nbsp;don’t have&nbsp;access to the new Prismatic Subclass when they should.&nbsp;As it turns out, this is a bug Bungie has already acknowledged, and a fix is readily available. That said, the workaround solution does require a little extra effort from affected players.</p> <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;expansion launches, as with many MMO expansion launches, are frequently filled with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-server-not-available-issue/" rel="noreferrer noopener">long waits due to player influx</a>&nbsp;and error codes.

While this may not be the news affected players want to hear, the bright side is that there is a solution, and all it requires is a little more time.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Of course, the best option is to&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;circumvent the issue altogether.&nbsp;For the best results, players shouldn’t try joining other players while the mission is in progress or start&nbsp;it&nbsp;with players who already have the new Subclass.&nbsp;If players&nbsp;aren’t sure&nbsp;if their run is affected, they’ll know for sure if there isn’t a large Prismatic interactable just before approaching the Rally flag for the final encounter.</p>

<p id="j91gYw">It’s an irresistibly Star Wars-y question, but more importantly, it’s a perfect frame for exactly the kind of action cred that was briefly, thrillingly, core to the Star Wars franchise. </p>

<p id="m9OsDr">How do you kill a Jedi without using a weapon? </p>
<p id="p8fEVU">This is the challenge posed to Mae, our erstwhile apprentice, by her master, who looks like a Sith and quacks like a Sith, but as yet has not had much time to espouse his alliances or philosophy. As the final lesson in her training, Mae has to kill at least one Jedi without using a weapon, in order to kill “the dream.” What dream? The dream that all Jedi live in, apparently, “a dream they believe everyone shares.” </p>
<p id="Ija6bt">According to Mae’s master, “An acolyte kills without a weapon; an acolyte kills the dream.” </p>
<h2 id="Vy6CJ9"><strong>What does that mean? </strong></h2>
<p id="V71VNA">It means everybody’s kung fu fighting, baby. </p>
<p id="1YsZWk"><em>The Acolyte</em>’s unarmed, hand-to-hand combat stuck out from the moment its trailers dropped. There’s very little anywhere in live-action Star Wars like it — the gravitational coolness of lightsabers is too much to escape. Jedi and Sith fight with swords; everybody knows this. Smugglers and soldiers use blasters. Wookiees have crossbows that shoot lasers. Even Donnie Yen’s enigmatic Force adherent-but-definitely-not-Jedi Chirrut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8trWiJLgs">fights with a stick</a>. Blame <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/12/21/22063580/star-wars-toys-action-figures-collectors-mandalorian-replicas">the market for action figures</a> with accessories, I suppose. </p>
<p id="UP2jiO">For all that Star Wars is rooted in samurai film, it has precious few callbacks to the immortal trope of a fighter who refuses to draw his blade. But in <em>The Acolyte</em>, that’s how every Mae-versus-Jedi fight begins, because a Jedi won’t draw on an unarmed foe. In these first two episodes, Mae’s clashes with Carrie-Anne Moss’ Master Indara and Lee Jung-jae’s Master Sol are hyper-quick, riveting battles for dominance, where we get to see Mae’s desperation contrasted with an unbreakable Jedi cool. We get those wild superhero moments when Mae reaches to steal a lightsaber <em>mid-combat</em> and is met with an impossibly quick twist of a supernaturally endowed body. It’s the blow-for-blow, arm’s length, move-and-counter suspense of a great hand-to-hand martial arts sequence.  </p>
<p id="leCEIJ">Mae’s quest to kill a Jedi without a weapon returns Star Wars to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24141905/star-wars-phantom-menace-lightsaber-duel-fates-fight-choreography">the realm of Fight Scene Cinema</a> that the franchise developed during production on the prequel films, but that has rarely, if ever, been equaled in live action since. But it also gives <em>The Acolyte</em> its best mystery. Not a whodunit, but a How Do You Do It?</p>
<p id="Od3No9">Sol and his allies are solving a murder mystery, sure — we’ve seen that a million times — but Mae is out here beating her head against a koan handed to her by a Murder Buddhist, and I’m just waiting for the moment when she realizes that <em>maybe</em> the answer isn’t literal. </p>

  <p id="ZxzT6r"><em>The Acolyte</em> is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20959862/star-wars-watch-order-disney-plus-movies-shows-chronological-skywalker-saga">latest Star Wars series</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23672528/star-wars-movies-tv-schedule-calendar-upcoming">launch on Disney Plus</a>. Unlike previous series, such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23896100/star-wars-ahsoka-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Ahsoka</em></a><em> </em>(after <em>Return of the Jedi</em>) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23475516/andor-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Andor</em></a><em> </em>(before <em>A New Hope</em>), it takes place in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673950/star-wars-timeline-dawn-of-jedi-new-order">a unique and largely unexplored era</a> of the Star Wars galaxy (in live action, at least). Created by Leslye Headland, a self-professed major Star Wars fan, and starring Lee Jung-jae, Amandla Stenberg, and Carrie-Anne Moss, <em>The Acolyte</em> is intended to be as new-viewer-friendly as possible. </p>
<p id="pmlGJH">That said, there are a few questions viewers may have as they head into the two-part series premiere, and we’ve got the answers!</p>
<h2 id="csTmFG"><strong>What is the High Republic? </strong></h2>
<p id="aKmVZz">Launched in January 2021, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24167362/star-wars-acolyte-high-republic-future">the High Republic began as a sub-franchise</a> publishing initiative from Lucasfilm, told across a variety of short stories, novels, and comic books. Named for the era of in-universe galactic history that marks a relative cultural and political high-water mark for the Republic in general and the Jedi specifically, stories set in the High Republic Era take place anywhere between 500 and 100 years before the events of the nine films that comprise the cinematic Skywalker Saga. For anyone familiar with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23845775/star-wars-old-republic-hella-tight">the Old Republic Era</a> thanks to the series of wildly popular video games set in that era, the High Republic Era falls squarely between that time and the time of the “main” movies.</p>
<p id="t4GfU0">The stories typically chronicle the conflict between the Jedi and the Nihil, a group of ruthless space pirates who use their arcane knowledge of hyperspace travel to carry out devastating attacks on the Republic. But one of the things that distinguishes the High Republic from similar era-specific publishing efforts is its wide scope. With stories told in everything from books for young readers to YA novels to traditional adult novels, from comic books to audio dramas, there are different tones and flavors for a wide variety of tastes. The Nihil are far from the only threat facing the galaxy, which also includes the Dregnir — a species of carnivorous sentient plants — as well as cults consisting of other non-Jedi Force users. The Jedi dealing with the threat of the Nihil during an era of prosperity forms the narrative backbone of the sub-franchise, but even in the short existence of the High Republic as a storytelling initiative, the sheer volume and breadth of stories released creates a lot of nooks and crannies to explore. </p>

<p id="J6hsHa"><em>The Acolyte</em> represents the first on-screen foray into the High Republic Era. It is also marking the latest point yet in the High Republic Era — that is, the point in time closest to the previously established events of the movies. Specifically, <em>The Acolyte</em> takes place about 100 years before the rise of the Empire, putting it toward the very tail end of the High Republic Era.</p>

<p id="XlJdBK">That point in the timeline is very much intentional. According to showrunner <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/leslye-headland-interview">Leslye Headland</a>, “If Star Wars is about the underdog versus the institution, [in <em>The Acolyte</em>] the Jedi are the institution. I was so interested in a storyline where the Jedi were at the height of their power — and I don’t mean <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, because at that point, there’s a Sith Lord in the Senate that they’re not picking up on.” Headland also expresses a desire to explore “what went wrong” that led the Jedi Order from the highs of the High Republic to the stagnation and ignorance displayed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23352914/best-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-ranked">during the prequel trilogy</a>, in which the Jedi are hoodwinked into aiding their own downfall by a threat hiding right under their collective noses. </p>
<p id="6abElN">Setting <em>The Acolyte</em> at the tail end of the Jedi heyday is thus critical to that examination. It allows Headland and her team the closest possible chronological point to the prequels, to draw the most direct line possible from the Jedi at their zenith to the Jedi at their nadir. </p>
<p id="F1Fehg">It’s also worth noting, to that end, that the Jedi of the High Republic are, in their ways, quite a bit different from the Jedi of the prequel trilogy. Some of the differences are simply aesthetic; in addition to the “typical” look of simple robes not unlike those worn by moisture farmers and desert hermits, the High Republic Jedi also don more resplendent dress robes of shimmering white and gold. Their lightsabers are more ornate (and, occasionally, more <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightwhip">whip-like</a>), with pronounced physical hilts, and they are worn in leather holsters rather than simply dangling from belts. Mission attire for High Republic Jedi includes leather gauntlets and armor. </p>
<p id="yJCFDI">But the differences go deeper than that. While the Jedi of the High Republic still teach about the dangers of attachment, they are less like the celibate monks of the prequel era. Deep friendships exist among the Jedi, and even, in at least one instance, physical intimacy (which is still frowned upon, but no one was drummed out of the Jedi Order over it). The High Republic Jedi also seem to have a deeper understanding of the Force, with certain Jedi dedicating themselves to the exploration of specific aspects of or abilities with the Force, such as battle meditation or the ability to strengthen the Force bonds among a group of Jedi. This can be seen in <em>The Acolyte</em> via Carrie-Anne Moss’ Indara, a Jedi who is proficient in something not unlike Force-aided kung fu.  </p>
<p id="A538NW">All of this serves to underscore the difference between the High Republic Jedi and the more familiar Jedi of the Skywalker Saga. Which, in turn, underscores that question Headland is eager to explore, of what caused those differences to emerge in the first place. </p>

<p id="FFzIbW">That answer is a bit more… complicated. In <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, Jedi council member Ki-Adi-Mundi (the conehead Jedi) tells Qui-Gon Jinn that the Sith have been extinct “for a millennium.” That would mean there’s no way the Sith could factor into <em>The Acolyte</em>, given it takes place a mere 100 years before Ki-Adi-Mundi made his declaration, well within that millennium. But, of course, Ki-Adi-Mundi is <em>wrong</em>. He’s wrong even before he speaks the words; the audience has already seen Qui-Gon battle Darth Maul on the sands of Tatooine, and the audience already knows Darth Maul is a Sith, even if the Jedi don’t. And, of course, the Sith’s whole deal is the “Rule of Two,” in which a series of masters and apprentices keep the whole Sith show running, specifically from the shadows. </p>
<p id="CQH6Ry">So the door is certainly open for the Sith to appear in <em>The Acolyte </em>(as they seem to in the first two episodes), albeit in a subtle way (that would still lead Ki-Adi-Mundi to make his incorrect declaration and not get laughed out of the council chambers). Headland has likened the Sith in this era to that of a <em>Velociraptor</em> for the Jedi: “Like it’s a thing I’ve heard of, but it’s not a thing that you would ever consider you’d be interacting with.” Whether they are the central antagonists, and, if so, how they manage to maintain their status as extinct beings of myth and legend remains to be seen. </p>

</p>
<p id="0hwWw5">Honestly, not really. Everyone involved has been very insistent that <em>The Acolyte</em> is not a series that requires homework. It is designed for anyone with just a passing familiarity with Star Wars to pick up and enjoy. </p>
<p id="EJLW5N">One thing worth noting is the presence of Vernestra Rwoh, the only named member of the cast thus far to previously appear in the High Republic. A teen prodigy Jedi, Vernestra made several appearances throughout the publishing line. But like <em>The Acolyte</em>’s setting in the High Republic timeline, her appearance in the series comes later in her own personal timeline, when she is over 100 years old. As a result, while the name will be familiar to High Republic readers, even they will have much to learn about her alongside newcomers.</p>
<p id="3Yx749">Also, anyone who has seen <em>Return of the Jedi </em>knows that Yoda is over 900 years old when he dies, which means he’s very much active during the High Republic Era. No word yet, however, whether he’ll appear in <em>The Acolyte</em>.  </p>

But did you know it’ll also have symmetrical PlayStation-esque joysticks, programmable dials around each one, twin Steam Deck-like trackpads, a small built-in kickstand, a Windows Hello camera instead of a fingerprint reader, and both top and bottom USB4 ports?</p><div><p>Thanks to journalists who descended on Taipei this week, we do — some of whom took <a href="https://x.com/SireGoupil/status/1797882313294160350">good photos</a>, including <a href="https://x.com/OKestGamer/status/1797881423556464777/photo/4">the entire spec sheet</a>. <em>PCWorld</em> even filmed <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6BT-7VxBhBw">a 20-minute long video tour</a>:</p></div><p>The handheld’s powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U chip, and you shouldn’t necessarily expect a lot from it — it’s largely the same as the 7840U that powered prior handhelds, with the same Radeon 780M iGPU inside. But like the ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go, it does upgrade to LPDDR5X-7500 memory, which seemingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">gave the Legion a slight performance bump</a> over the original Ally — and at a more modest 1080p resolution. </p><p>Less pleasingly, Zotac appears to have outfitted it with a modest 48.5 watt-hour battery pack as well, smaller than that of the Steam Deck OLED and vastly smaller than the 80Wh packs that Asus and MSI just announced — and its 7-inch 120Hz OLED screen <a href="https://x.com/carygolomb/status/1797848535054086492">doesn’t support variable refresh rate</a> any more than the Steam Deck’s one did.

But while AirJet maker Frore Systems <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23975368/frore-airjet-apple-macbook-air-fanless-mems#:~:text=Frore%20seems%20to%20think%20AirJets%20could%20fit%20into%20a%20Steam%20Deck%2C%20too.">seems to think it’d work</a>, Zotac suggested the current AirJet isn’t yet designed to cool chips as high wattage as the 8840U — and that cost might also be a concern. For now, the Zone has a single traditional fan and a couple of smallish vents to help keep it cool.</p><p>According <a href="https://www.geeknetic.es/Noticia/31877/ZOTAC-nos-ensena-su-GAME-ZONE-en-el-COMPUTEX-lanzamiento-previsto-para-septiembre-por-800-euros.html">to <em>Geeknetic</em></a>, the Zone should cost around $800 in September of this year. That’s on the high end of consumer gaming handhelds, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">though the Ally X</a>, with its dramatically bigger battery, is also launching at that price.</p><p>Zotac, if you’re reading this: we’re happy to get the details from you next time!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/contraband-a-ways-off-report-avalanche-shuts-down-multiple-studios/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>What’s the deal with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/contraband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contraband</a>, the Xbox-published co-op game coming from Just Cause and Rage 2 developer Avalanche Studios? The project was announced back in 2021, and that’s about all we’ve heard about it. That said, with a big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> coming up, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-is-targeting-2025-contraband-might-launch-this-year-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old rumors that Contraband may be targeting 2024</a>, some have got their hopes up that we may see the game soon.</p>
<p>Well, you may want to cool your jets. On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Oc0705wD0WA?si=qWrLIOzeNi4Gafzy&amp;t=3705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent episode of Colt Eastwood’s Xbox News Cast</a>, one of the hosts Magg said Contraband isn’t coming until “well into” 2025 as the game is still in a rough state.</p>
<p><em>“I've been told it's been delayed. It's going to be delayed well into 2025, could be the end of 2025. But, the people that I know, the footage that I saw, the people that played the game and sent me all their [...] impromptu reviews of what they played, they said the game is fun, it was great. It was a very early build. [...] Like, the cars didn't have drivers in them, you couldn't see their heads, it was literally ghost cars driving around.”</em></p>
<p>Now, this Magg doesn’t necessarily have much of a leaking track record, but during the podcast, The Verge’s Tom Warren, who does have a long, reliable track record, popped up in the comments section to confirm “Contraband is a ways off, for sure.”</p>
<p>Of course, take this all with a grain of salt for now, but it sounds like Contraband is not something Xbox is preparing to launch in the immediate future. In related news, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/just-cause-developer-avalanche-closing-two-studios-and-laying-off-50-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche recently announced the closure of two North American studios</a> located in New York and Montreal, resulting in around 50 layoffs (that represents around a 10th of their total workforce). This leaves Avalanche with three main European studios located in Stockholm, Liverpool, and Malmo, Sweeden. Whether this downsizing has anything to do with the somewhat slow progress being made on Contraband is unknown.</p>
<p>Contraband is currently slated to release on PC and Xbox Series X/S. An official launch window has not been announced.</p>

                <p>Harvest Moon: One World is getting a new Complete Edition for Nintendo Switch that will bundle the base game with all post-launch DLC for $30. Harvest Moon: One World Complete launches on <strong>August 13</strong>, and preorders for the physical edition are now available online. You can even get a limited-edition plush with the game while supplies last.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Harvest Moon: One World preorder bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4305529-oneworldplush.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305529" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4305529-oneworldplush.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305529"></a><figcaption>Harvest Moon: One World Comeplete Yeti plush preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4305529-oneworldplush.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first batch of physical edition Harvest Moon: One World Complete preorders will include a special plush character based on the Yeti creature you can encounter in-game. So far, the Yeti plush is only listed as a bonus if you preorder directly from Natsume; the Amazon listing does not mention the bonus plush. However, since Amazon doesn't charge for preorders until your order ships, you could secure your copy early at both locations and wait to see if the plush is confirmed for Amazon, then cancel one of the orders before launch.</p><div title="6523580 - Harvest Moon: One World Complete" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2391" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523580 - Harvest Moon: One World Complete" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Harvest Moon: One World Complete</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-World-Complete-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0D2ZBM7PX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Harvest Moon: One World Complete is an expanded version of the game, which originally launched in 2021 for Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The initial release featured five explorable world regions and 10 romanceable NPCs, but the post-launch paid DLC boosted that content to six total regions and 12 romanceable characters, alongside additional house decorations, pets, and other items to collect. All that extra content is included with the new Complete version. You can preorder Harvest Moon: Complete Edition for $30 at Amazon, or at <a href="https://natsumestore.com/products/pre-order-harvest-moon-one-world-complete-with-free-sasquatch-plush" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Natsume's online store</a>. </p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Harvest Moon: One World iterates on the long-running series' farming and life-sim gameplay, turning it into a more exploration-based adventure with elements that seem heavily inspired by Pokemon. Players create their own character and then embark on a quest to collect Harvest Wisps hidden throughout the world that unlock new crops in their "Vegedex" that can be farmed with the new portable "expando-farm."</p><p dir="ltr">While the game was met with mixed reception from critics and fans, this new Complete edition's $30 price tag and comprehensive content package will likely be the best way to experience the game for Switch players. That said, if you don't want to wait--or don't play on Switch--you can also grab the original release at Amazon for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-One-World-Xbox/dp/B09BDWPNKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 on Xbox One</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Moon-One-World-Standard-PlayStation/dp/B08FBVCGPF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>.

However, if you’ve never played <em>Destiny 2</em> or haven’t played in a long time, tons of content has been added and it can be a bit difficult figuring out how to get into the new expansion content. This is the fastest way to start <em>The Final Shape</em> for those new and returning <em>Destiny 2</em> players.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-skip-ahead-to-destiny-2-the-final-shape-content" data-injectable="false">How to skip ahead to <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> content</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="true">As a new player who has not played <em>Destiny 2</em> at all, you will have one extra step over those that are returning after a long hiatus. Create your character and start <em>Destiny 2</em> which will plop you into the Cosmodrome region on Earth. This is essentially the beginning of the game, but don’t worry; you only have to do the first mission. Once you reach the end, you’ll get a quest that tasks you with speaking to Commander Shaw which is also located in the same Cosmodrome region as you and should be highlighted on your map.</p>

This will unlock two new quests, one titled A Guardian Rises which tasks you with progressing through the original <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign, and another called Learning Light which is what you are looking for. Once you start the Learning Light quest you can return to the flag where you synched with Shaw’s ship, and you will now see the option to Skip New Light.</p>
 <h3 id="h-skip-new-light-and-acquire-your-new-light-kit" data-injectable="false">Skip New Light and acquire your New Light Kit</h3> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Doing so will skip ahead and allow you to bypass completing the story missions, which will unlock the Tower and a new campaign quest specific to your class. Visit the Tower and head to the class NPC marked by your quest objective to acquire your New Light Kit which is essentially a set of starter gear that you would normally have the equivalent of if you actually played through the original campaign story missions.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-visit-zavala-at-the-tower-and-reach-guardian-rank-2" data-injectable="false">Visit Zavala at the Tower and reach Guardian Rank 2</h3> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="813" data-injectable="true">Afterward, you will be tasked with heading to Zavala to continue the Spark of Hope questline. It will seem as though it’s making you go through the entire quest line, but I assure you it’s not. Zavala gives you the objective of hitting Guardian Rank 2, which simply requires you to open your Character screen, hit the Journey tab, then click to level up to Guardian Rank 2. Head to the Ironwood Tree right next to you at the Tower and you will officially progress to rank 2 and complete the objective.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-return-to-zavala-and-start-the-final-shape-quest-and-unlock-the-pale-heart-destination" data-injectable="false">Return to Zavala and start The Final Shape quest and unlock The Pale Heart destination</h3> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Finally, head back to Zavala which is nearby on the Tower and speak to him. Confirm you’ve reached Guardian Rank 2 and as long as you have purchased <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> expansion, he will now give you the breadcrumb quest to start the expansion titled The Final Shape and will also unlock the new area for the expansion called The Pale Heart.</p>
 <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="98" data-injectable="false">Congratulations, you’re all caught up and ready to start playing <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>!</p>

There are new enemies, a brand new location to explore, and a showdown with the biggest baddie the universe has ever seen, The Witness. </p> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Players will battle against The Witness in the new raid that <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> adds. This raid, Salation’s Edge, will see players head out and face The Witness in a colossal battle between light and darkness. It’ll settle the fate of this universe once and for all. However, before players can even contemplate jumping into the raid, they’ll need to reach the right Power Level. This is the in-game level of their Guardian and is based on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their gear</a> and weapon levels, meaning we’ve all got some grinding to do. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-power-level-do-you-need-to-play-the-salvation-s-edge-raid-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">What Power Level do you need to play the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">To play the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salvation’s Edge raid</a> in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, players must be at least <strong>Power Level 1965</strong>. Players have three days to reach this level, which will not be easy. Playing through the entire campaign on Legendary will get you most of the way, but there’s also an Exotic Quest and, of course, a lot of grinding you can do in the new activities in The Pale Heart to help you reach that lofty Power Level. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to grind Power Levels in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">To grind Power Levels in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> in preparation for the Salvation’s Edge raid, players need to log in daily and complete every activity that will give them powerful rewards. This includes weekly and daily rewards for activities everywhere in the game, be that Crucible, Gambit, Strikes, or The Pale Heart. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Note that you should be doing this after completing <em>The Final Shape</em> campaign on Legendary. If you don’t, you’re going to struggle to hit the required Power Level in time for the raid’s launch. If you don’t mind, you can grind away in the background without stressing. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">These rewards will give you gear that’s guaranteed to be stronger than what you currently hold, so equip your most powerful items every time you close in on a powerful reward. The new location will also be filled with new activities to complete for your profile, many of which could end up giving you more of the gear you seek. </p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">The one thing I always do is make sure I have as many bounties as possible. These help you grind out Season Pass levels but also count towards powerful rewards with all vendors. The more you complete, the higher your chances of getting a random yet very strong piece of gear that’ll help you close in on that raid-ready Power Level. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">Finally, keep on top of your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-artifact-perks-coming-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifact</a>. This item opens up some great mods you can use on your gear and weapons, and every level you earn for it counts towards your Power Level. If you’re grinding for the raid, even a single Power Level added here counts for those desperate to play on day one. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to start the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">To start the Salvation’s Edge raid in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, players must launch the game, open the map, and pick it from the available activities. You should be able to find it in The Pale Heart location, which is inside of the Traveler in the middle of the screen. </p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="false">Note that the raid won’t be available until <strong>June 7, 20224, at 1 p.m. ET</strong>. This is when Contest Mode will be enabled for all the registered teams to hop in and try to be the first in the world to complete it. It’s unknown what will happen once the raid has been completed, but recent raids have all changed the game world in some way, opening up new activities. So it’s worth keeping an eye on the standings even if you’re not playing. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced.889782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the TTRPG community, Roll20 is one of the largest virtual tabletop platforms on the market. It boasts one of the largest libraries of resources and hosts millions of games every day. Now, that platform will have more resources with an official Roll20 Demiplane acquisition.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition was covered in a report by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/roll20-announces-purchase-of-demiplane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comicbook.com</a>. According to the report, the purchase goes into effect today, providing Roll20 with a suite of character creation tools that can work in tandem with the VTT and online marketplace DriveThruRPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=roQyzWMV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=tRvN-0Rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of convenience may be coming to Roll20.</figcaption></figure><p>For those unaware, Demiplane is a VTT known for its robust suite of character-creation tools and RPG resource compendiums. Its closest competition in terms of convenience and usability on the market is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-buys-up-dd-beyond-from-fandom">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. Demiplane's supported titles include Paizo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus">Pathfinder</a>, Paradox Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane"><em>World of Darkness</em></a>, and Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/demiplane-partners-with-darrington-press-to-launch-candela-obscura-nexus"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>In an interview with Roll20's CEO, Ankit Lai explained the reason for the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition. Lai explained that it was to further Roll20's goal of creating a seamless user experience. This aligns with the platform's past partnerships, providing user-created content through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dms-guild-content-now-on-roll20">DMs Guild</a> or easy battlemap creation through <a href="https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/16979743281943-Getting-Started-with-Dungeon-Scrawl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeon Scrawl</a>.</p>

<p>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition won't have any immediate impact on users, but Demiplane CEO Peter Romenesko noted that merged companies will look to close the difference between their two platforms very quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What you'll see is a very concentrated effort to bring the distance between each of these different solutions that are now under the Roll20 brand, really start to bring them closer. Both in digital proximity so that all of a sudden you can start to use these things across the whole platform, whether you're playing in person or online....You may not notice [these changes] one by one, but it's something that we're really committed to. In addition, we'll continue to bring out a whole bunch of great games on our platform and find out really unique ways to bring Demiplane into DriveThruRPG and the virtual tabletop."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing which game systems will support Demiplane character sheet integration on Roll20. However, it is confirmed this acquisition will allow the support of playtest material for upcoming systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

The game marks the long-awaited return of the Test Drive series, which has been on hiatus since 2012. Solar Crown will be the first entry in the series published by Nacon, as the franchise has switched hands numerous times since its original debut way back in 1987. Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown will let players explore a vast open map from behind the wheel of real-world luxury cars, and engage in online races against other players.</p><p dir="ltr">While the launch is still a few months away, racing game fans can preorder Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown now on PC or console.

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> fast approaching, the development team at Square Enix are doing everything in their power to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-begins-testing-cross-region-data-center-travel-later-this-month/">ease the expected congestion</a> when it comes to logging in around release.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The latest move is to provide players with more choices for their home world by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/93750e4b0d6d5a4faf6a00dee199082392f1a754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating four new worlds</a> on the existing North American Data Center, Dynamis. The DC has been running at half capacity since its launch in 2022, with four worlds, as opposed to the normal eight per DC.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The four new worlds will be added on June 11 at 3 a.m. PDT / 6 a.m. EST, bringing the following new worlds live and ready for new or existing players to populate:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Cuchulainn</li> <li>Golem</li> <li>Kraken</li> <li>Rafflesia</li> </ul> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">On top of boosting the capacity of North American servers, the four new worlds will also have completely empty housing districts, which is potentially the most exciting aspect of this news for a lot of people.</p> <h2 id="h-how-housing-works-on-new-worlds-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How housing works on ‘new’ worlds in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it, getting a house in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is never easy, even with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-housing-lottery-explained/">Lottery system</a> which was introduced in patch 6.1. However, being an early entrant into a brand new world can significantly boost your chances of getting your dream Eorzean home.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">All of these up for grabs plots will all be subject to the same conditions as any other as part of the Housing Lottery, with wards 1 to 9 being exclusively available to those seeking a base for their FC, while wards 10 to 24 will be reserved for players wanting a private residential oasis.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">For those who are interested in transferring to one of these new worlds but worried about giving up any property they already own on your current world, don’t fret. If you choose to up sticks, you’ll actually be eligible for a pretty hefty boost in funds. Not only will the full price of the estate you own be fully reimbursed, but you’ll also get 3,000,000 Gil for your willingness to leave your old world behind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">In the case of apartments, you’ll get the 500,000 Gil that you paid for the apartment back and also a bonus of another 500,000 Gil.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">However, it’s worth noting that if you choose to do this, you’ll need to keep hold of your current property while going through the Home World Transfer process. If you give up the rights to your property before the process is completed, you won’t be eligible to receive any bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">On top of these housing perks, there are also some other good reasons to transfer to a new world:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"> <li>The <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/option_service/world_transfer_service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home World Transfer Service</a> is free of charge (usually costs $18.00 USD)</li> <li>You’ll receive 10 Gold Chocobo Feathers, which can be exchanged for the following: <ul> <li>Managarm mount (8 feathers)</li> <li>Amber Draught Chocobo (8 feathers)</li> <li>Twintania Neurolink Key (15 feathers)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Double EXP bonus until level 80 is achieved</li> </ul>
