<hr>
<p>I’ve spent 20 years “awww-ing” over the delightful character of Chibi-Robo despite having never played any of his games. This cute little robot is just joy incarnate – tiny and helpful with gormless black eyes. Whether it be his trophy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_smash_bros_brawl">Smash Bros. Brawl</a> or magazine ads for the DS or 3DS games, I always fawned over gaming’s littlest guy.</p>
<p>But now, I’ve <em>finally</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, and it seems like this little metal dude was all a ruse. Well, kind of: the character is cute, but the game? No one warned me I’d need a therapy session afterwards.</p><div><figure data-videoid="dvEWyBr3KsU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvEWyBr3KsU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dvEWyBr3KsU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvEWyBr3KsU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5fd5a0viqtnp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvEWyBr3KsU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Chibi-Robo is an odd duck; quirky in the way you’d expect for a mid-2000s GameCube game starring a tiny robot who cleans up after a dysfunctional family. It oozes charm from every pore, from the garbled character voices to the garishly decorated, 1970s-style house. It’s laugh-out-loud funny, too, and the gameplay loop, while a little repetitive and sometimes vague, has a nice rhythm to it. It’s <em>nice</em> just to clean up, collect trash, and make people happy, right?</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/da9af04194620/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I want to make the Sandersons happy. They’re the dysfunctional family at the centre of the story, but calling them so feels like I’m doing them a disservice. They’re a family in crisis, torn apart by spiralling debt and family feuds, with a young daughter crying for attention in the middle of it all. And the little robot is part of the catalyst that kicks things off.</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a gift for Jenny, the Sanderson’s daughter, on her eighth birthday. The problem is, Chibi-Robo isn’t cheap, and the father, George, seems to have a knack for spending money on expensive toys and robotics. It’s what got the Sandersons into debt, which you gradually pick up by interacting with both the father and mother, Helen, as well as examining bills and books with red pen scribbled all over them.</p>
<p>Yet here I am, as Chibi-Robo, scrubbing muddy pawprints off the floor with a toothbrush, scooping up sweet wrappers and storing them in my head, and consuming electricity by recharging my batteries. Oh, what’s that? The Sandersons are behind on their electricity bills, too? I should probably slow down a little.</p>

<p>Making friends with the many sentient toys scattered around the house <em>does</em> provide some light relief – they’re all utterly bizarre with fun personalities and voices to match – but they too are products of a struggling family. Giga-Robo, Chibi-Robo’s predecessor, was abandoned because he cost too much. The Free Rangers are mourning the loss of a comrade, who was “captured” by the family dog. Then there’s Captain Plankbeard who couldn’t bring himself to steal a “dubloon” because he was worried about the Sanderson’s finances.</p>
<p>What makes it hit harder is that most of the toys are ones George bought, and even though they have their own issues and concerns for the family, the fact that they cost money fuels Helen’s frustrations. So much so, when I brought Helen a receipt for <em>another</em> toy, she locked herself in the bedroom and threatened divorce.</p>
<p>I may be getting Happy Points for doing these chores, but in reality, am I <em>really</em> making the Sandersons happy? I’m going between the husband and wife, swapping notes or pleading forgiveness, proving points and point scoring, all while Jenny, the daughter, is left sobbing at night or glued to the TV screen in her room.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5471c38f77624/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>How do you process divorce, or the potential of divorce, at eight years old? I was ten when my parents split up and I don’t think I really understood the full scope, including the emotional toll, until a decade later. Thankfully, it never comes to that in Chibi-Robo, but during my entire playthrough, all I could think about was how to make Jenny happy.</p>
<p>Every morning I’d seek her out and give her any Frog Rings I’d found around the house – she loves frogs, and wears a frog hat, speaking mostly in “ribbits” because she’s been cursed by the Frog Wizard, so she tells me. In reality, she’s wearing the hood for attention. Her parents are too busy fighting, so the only time they ever really speak to her is to tell her to take the hood off or complain.</p>
<p>Jenny was the first person to clue me into what was actually going on, not the parents; George would talk about his love of toys, while Helen would just complain about George. Jenny was the first to tell me why George was sleeping on the couch. My heart broke when I found her crying on the staircase one night, all because her parents fought. And the only way to fully understand her is by wearing a Frog Suit.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/89e0d7d217af8/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s easy to blame the parents, but that wasn’t my reaction, particularly as the toys seem endeared to the Sandersons and spoke fondly of the past. Helen and George both appreciated everything I did for them, praising me for cleaning, turning the TV on, or gifting flowers. No gesture was too big or small for thanks.</p>
<p>And you can see the two struggling; Helen still clearly loves her husband, but she’s at the end of her tether, while George knows he’s done wrong and attempts to win Helen back. Chibi-Robo steadily becomes a cycle of people-pleasing, an attempt to fix a rift in a fractured family while helping piece the lives of the toys together.</p>
<p>The real kicker comes from realising that it’s no one person’s fault – everyone is at fault in the Sanderson household in some way or another. Helen was too harsh on George, expecting him to grow up and live up to her ideal image of a husband and father. George was too proud, too fearful of revealing why he no longer had a job. And Jenny maybe could scribble on the floor a bit less (small potatoes, of course, I’ll always clean up after Jenny).</p>
<p>What this all culminates in is Chibo-Robo travelling back in time inside an alien spaceship and discovering the secret password to George’s suitcase. Turns out, those spydorz that have been chasing you? George made them, but they were corrupted by the corporation he worked for, causing him to leave the company and seal the most dangerous of these away.</p>
<p>What this means is all those fears, all that anxiety from debt and despair, leads to a giant spydor entangling the house and the Sandersons in thick cobwebs. It’s a completely unpredictable moment, and honestly? A magnetic, metallic spider the size of a small human is pretty terrifying.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/09e5e25e4e71d/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even after defeating the mechanical spider, however, things aren’t done. News reports that the Chibi-Robo craze is putting a strain on the electricity grid start airing; the Sandersons watch, but they don’t have a solution. The very thing that helped bring them together might save their happiness, and may cost them more money, but it might be a greater threat.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing miracles exist in the form of alien wishes, then, as Giga-Robo – which I’ve spent the whole game trying to fix – is brought back to life, and granted infinite power by the aliens. No more will Giga or Chibi consume energy from the grid, and no more will the Sandersons have to pay.</p>
<p>The “accomplishment” gains media attention and, presumably, resolves the Sandersons’ debt and money issues. Jenny seems happy once again, and the family goes back to a relative normalcy. Everything resolves itself by the luck of magic, like a childhood dream that you pray hard and hard for every night.</p>

<p>By the end of my playthrough, I felt reflective. Having watched my family tear itself apart as a kid, and having seen and lived through the consequences of not paying off bills or struggling for money, I wish I could’ve had a miracle like Chibi-Robo, like Jenny. Something to help ease the burden, something to talk to, and something very cute to sit and watch.</p>
<p>But then it hit me. Yes, there’s no easy “miracle” to pay off debts, and money – particularly in the current climate – is tight. But the best thing you can do for someone who’s struggling? Be there for them. Every little thing you can do is enough, just like Chibi-Robo. There’s nothing miraculous about helping out, after all.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-update-1-62-brings-a-brand-new-corvette-and-more.1281951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have revealed&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62, and in the racing sim's latest update, you can drive a brand new Corvette, plus three more exciting new vehicles.</p>

<p>August's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">follows on from July's</a>, in which a very rare car was added to the roster to give you a once-in-a-lifetime driving experience (virtually, of course). This update doesn't have anything quite so rare, but it does have a brand new hypercar that "offers a glimpse into the future of the Corvette".</p>

<p>The '25 Chevrolet Corvette CX Concept is an all-electric vehicle with a very sleek design and over 2,000hp, and it's available for you to check out in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.62-chevrolet-corvette.jpg?itok=2vgdi28K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.62-chevrolet-corvette.jpg?itok=ryMHjPFS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new Chevrolet Corvette is waiting for you in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</figcaption></figure><p>If this car isn't your bag, then there are three others included as part of this update. The first, the '26 Afeela 1, is described by Sony and Polyphony Digital as a car that will "challenge the concept of transportation", and it's the first production model following the introduction of the prototype at CES 2024.</p>

<p>Another new Chevrolet Corvette concept car, the CX.R Vision Gran Turismo, is available in Update 1.62 as well, but if your tastes skew a little more street-level, you can drive the '02 Renault Avantime 3.0 V6 24V, a more modest (but no less fascinating) car.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, comes alongside new Extra Menus, new World Circuit events, and a new featured Curation in Scapes in the form of Tokyo Bay. You can check out a trailer showing it all off right here.</p>




<p>This update arrives just after Sony introduced a brand new official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/official-gran-turismo-7-car-database" rel="nofollow">car database</a>, which collects the hundreds of vehicles currently available in the game in one handy place for your perusal.</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62 arrives today at 10pm Pacific (that's tomorrow at 1am Eastern or around 6am GMT). The game is available right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is out now, and while it's a lot prettier or at least, more Unreal than the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3, it's got its fair share of technical problems. Curiously, two of the major crashing issues involve crocodiles. If you want a smooth opening bout of Snake Eater, I would avoid either pretending to be a crocodile or having lunch in the presence of a hungry one. Did a crocodile work on this game? There seems to be some underlying reptilian resentment at work, which I guess is to be expected from a game called Snake Eater.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Konami, of course, are well aware of these issues, and are working on a patch. They'll roll the fixes out in stages, with exact release timing to follow. Here's their shortlist of the known issues, plucked from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>
<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Who amongst us has not rolled into a crawl and ended up drifting across the scenery? I think it's got something to do with eating parsnips after their sell-by-date. Konami are mum as to what might happen if you roll into a crawl while wearing a crocodile hat. Presumably, your keyboard will grow teeth and clamp shut around your hands.</p>
<p>Sulky swamp lizards aside, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is notable for having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-platinum-game-hidden-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-thats-actually-a-remake-of-a-rework-of-a-zone-of-the-enders-3-prototype">a whole Platinum game inside it that is secretly a cancelled Zone Of The Enders 3 prototype</a>. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level-2000620693</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The (nearly) complete <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em></a> experience, including all 25 levels and bald assassin Agent 47 himself, is making the leap from consoles and PC to iPhone and iPad. But folks might be shocked by the high sticker price of this new, portable version of the stealth action game.</p> <p>On August 27, as previously teased, IO Interactive released <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitman-world-of-assassination/id6742786366?platform=ipad"><em>Hitman: WOA</em> on the Apple App Store</a>. It supports newer iPhones and iPads and includes almost the full experience, though it isn’t shipping with the wonderful roguelike mode, Freelancer. Instead, that will be added in a later, free update. Still, having all of <em>Hitman, Hitman 2, </em>and <em>Hitman 3 </em>in your pocket is wild. It also isn’t cheap. This version of the game can be downloaded freely, and you can play the first level at no cost, but to play the rest of the game, you’ll need to fork over $70. Or you can spend $3 per level, which equals around $72 before tax. Yikes.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HITMAN World of Assassination - iOS Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYJwROKrP6I?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to a press release for the new port, IOI has “designed an entirely touch control scheme built specifically for iPhone and iPad.” Which is neat, but don’t worry, the game supports controllers, too. Still, I can’t help but look at that $70 price tag for a mobile game, one which is a many-years-old console/PC port, and make a weird noise. This same package, with Freelancer, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOopEwi6qPusLtSLqi-aw1HtKt3Iqx9rbzeD9cicht8xalRqrsLvV#dlc">is available on Switch 2 for just $60.</a> It seems odd to charge such a premium for a mobile port, especially when there’s plenty of data to show that these fancy iPhone AAA ports <a href="https://kotaku.com/re7-aaa-ios-iphone-village-remake-flop-low-sales-why-1851595596">don’t sell well at all on the platform.</a></p> <p>But I need to be careful and stop being too critical of this pricey new <em>Hitman</em> phone port because I just noticed my neighbor trimming the bushes outside looks a lot more bald and brooding than usual, and is that a rubber duck in his hand…oh no.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, I traveled to Cologne, Germany, to attend Gamescom and play more than two dozen games. One of those games was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth mainline installment in Capcom's long-running survival horror series. Although <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">it was the same demo from June's Summer Games Fest event</a> in Los Angeles, featuring Grace Ashcroft in a decrepit care center attempting to escape from a monstrous creature stalking the halls, it was still <em>my </em>first time playing it.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read my hands-on preview thoughts on that demo in my <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/the-most-dope-games-weve-played-during-gamescom-2025">Gamescom preview round-up here</a>, but it was only half of my Requiem experience last week. I also sat down to interview Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa. In our 30-minute interview, we discussed the type of horror the team is aiming for in Requiem, why it was time to return to Raccoon City and zombies, the differences between the game's third-person and first-person gameplay, and more. Enjoy!</p><h2>Interviewing The Director And Producer Of Resident Evil Requiem</h2>

</article>
<p><em><strong>Game Informer </strong></em><strong>editor Wesley LeBlanc: Every Resident Evil has a theme. Biohazard was about a southern backwoods family, and Village was Resident Evil's take on classic Universal monsters. How would you describe the horror theme of Requiem?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Director Koshi Nakanishi</strong>: We've been emphasizing in marketing materials, "Return to Raccoon City," and that we're returning to the main storyline of the series and looking to push it forward with horror. And you'll see, if you've played the demo, using characters like Grace and the creature you saw, we introduce this storyline and theme, and they're quite unique as an approach for Resident Evil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Producer Masato Kumazawa</strong>: One of the elements that you can expect to return is zombies; they are back. We are focusing more on the monsters, a variety of different enemies from the creature you saw in the demo to the next level, the next version of our zombies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You trip as Grace in third-person but not in first-person. Why is that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We originally planned to just switch the camera hud, but we realized that if you take the camera out from first to third, because of the way Grace is animated – as a first-person model – it looks like she's just walking around straight, with no reaction. It was unnatural. First-person is already more immersive, but that immersion has to be represented in other ways in third-person, which is why we have extra reactions like tripping. If we added tripping to first-person, moving the camera like that would make you motion sick. In third-person, it's about seeing her fear and reaction to the scenario, and going through the rest of the game, we start building in more reactions. There's no point in adding these in first-person because you wouldn't see them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kumazawa</strong>: There are surprise reactions she does in the demo. In third-person, something might happen, and you see her jump, whereas in first-person, there's a bit of a camera move instead. When she takes damage or gets hit, there's no need to do much in first-person, but there are specific animations in third-person to let you feel and show how much she got hurt.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><strong>With tripping and other animations that theoretically slow down gameplay, is it fair to say third-person is harder?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We don't want to be unfair, so we'll give you a little peek behind the curtain: when you trip, you can't see it, but the creature doesn't move. Third-person never feels like an unfair advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why return to the Ashcroft family now, and why pick a family from the Outbreak series?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: Alyssa Ashcroft was actually the perfect character for our needs in this game; there really was no other character in mind. Returning to Raccoon City after all this time meant looking back on the incident itself and Umbrella and the themes we haven't visited in a while. Alyssa is a survivor of the incident, and she goes on to journalistically investigate and find the truth and expose the cover-up. But she pays the price for curiosity, presumably gets too close to the truth, and someone or some entity has her killed to silence her. Grace, being the character to take up the torch from her mother after all these years, wants to find the truth after the incident and the murder of her mother. Two generations of Ashcrofts are the perfect choice for our storytelling and moving the main series forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you talk to me a bit about the hulking creature design in the demo? What are some of the inspirations behind it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We had a lot of different concepts through the design phase. So, to be honest, there's not any one particular inspiration from other works. The main objective has been, with quite a few games with stalker enemies and different variations, for her to stand out from the pack. The main single-sentence summary of her: As soon as you lay your eyes on her, you know this isn't right; you need to get away from this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Requiem has a few definitions. What does it mean in the context of this game?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: It's along the lines of remembrance for the dead. As we discussed earlier, Alyssa and Grace are a key family relationship that kicks everything off: Alyssa's murder, Grace's grief, her desire to avenge, her desire to solve her mother's murder, and the aftermath of the Raccoon City incident.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you expand on the line: "This is merely the overture to our darkest symphony yet?"</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: The musical allusions are a call back to the title. Using a musical metaphor to say this is a requiem for the mass of the dead; even when you watch the SGF presentation or if you've played the same section yourself, and think this is dark and scary – this is just the beginning. It's our way of tying together the title and the metaphor and saying, "If you think this is scary, you haven't seen anything yet."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Does that mean Requiem is the scariest Resident Evil yet?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: That's a bit of a tricky question. I directed [Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]. I know for a lot of players, it was too scary, so scary they couldn't finish it. I'm not aiming to make this the scariest Resident Evil ever. It will be very scary, but I want you to get through the whole thing and enjoy it. It's about a release of tension and catharsis and actually surviving it, but it's certainly up there in terms of how scary Requiem is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kumazawa</strong>: The camera perspective changes are part of this. If you feel it's too scary in first-person, jump out to third-person. But overall, we're aiming to have a rollercoaster ride of a thrilling, well-paced storyline. If we're at max horror the whole time, people can't take it and put the controller down. We want, "Wow, that was scary," and then some exploration and puzzle-solving, then some action combat, and then we bring you back into the fear.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><strong>Can you talk about the persistent theme of family across this trilogy?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We don't really think of [Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil Village, and Resident Evil Requiem] as a trilogy. 7 and 8 are a duology. Ethan's story concludes at the end of Village. Requiem is the ninth mainline title, but it's moving back to the series' mainstream, as it were, [...] to push the storyline forward. In that sense, I don't think family is a main theme of Requiem. It's part of it, but not as emphasized as the past two mainline titles. Part of Grace's motivation is things like finding out what happened to her mother, but that isn't the complete theme of the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What's it like within the team, finally returning to Raccoon City in a new way after all these years?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: There are a lot of Resident Evil fans on the team, so naturally, we find it very exciting, and it's fun to finally tackle the idea of what's happening inside the city. The fans, though, they go to the next level, with even more speculation and questions. We do have a lot of expectations to live up to, but we're confident you will love it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Resident Evil Requiem hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 27, 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/alyssa-ashcroft-returns-in-new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer">the latest Resident Evil Requiem trailer</a>, and then read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/leon-s-kennedy-was-considered-a-bad-match-for-resident-evil-requiem">why Leon S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There are a lot of Silent Hill things going on at the moment, so you may have forgotten that a sequel to 2006’s Silent Hill film is going to be released this year*. The movie makers have also forgotten something, mainly that there has already been a sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-revelations-3d/">2012’s Silent Hill: Revelations.</a></p>
<p>This new sequel is doing a <em>“James Cameron / Terminator”</em> thing as the 2006 movie director, Christopher Gans, is returning and pretending the 2012 movie does not exist. Return to Silent Hill is based on Silent Hill 2 and stars Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson. It also features <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9043183/?ref_=tt_cst_t_5">Pearse Egan</a> as Eddie Dombrowski, who featured in an indie film for which I wrote the dance music. Small world innit?</p>


<p>Pyramid Head, or “Red Pyramid” as he is known in the film despite not being red, can be seen at the end of the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Return to Silent Hill - Official Teaser Trailer (2025) Jeremy Irvine, Hannah Emily Anderson" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jas34nN2IKQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Return to Silent Hill brings the iconic horror franchise back to the screen. When James receives a mysterious letter from his lost love Mary, he is drawn to Silent Hill—a once-familiar town now consumed by darkness. As he searches for her, James faces monstrous creatures and unravels a terrifying truth that will push him to the edge of his sanity.”</p>

<p>I quit enjoyed both of the previous Silent Hill movies, they certainly stuck more to the themes of the games than all the Resident Evil movies did.</p>
<p><em>*Just to confuse things the trailer is dated for 2025, but other sources say the film will be out in January 2026.</em></p>

<p>Developer and publisher Tribute Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a>) has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/scott_pilgrim_ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a> on Nintendo Switch, confirming the addition of two new playable characters.</p>
<p>So who might these playable characters be? Surely they're good guys like Wallace Wells or Knives Chau, right? Wrong. Say hello to Lucas Lee and Roxie Richter, two of Ramona Flowers' evil exes and minor antagonists from the original comic series.</p>
<p>With Toronto overrun with gangs, members of the band Sex Bob-Omb have been kidnapped, forcing Scott and Ramona to join forces with her former foes, each of which bring their own unique fighting style to the fray. Scott Pilgrim EX displays the same exceptional animation that Tribute Games is known for, while staying true to the original Ubisoft game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/scott_pilgrim_vs_the_world_the_game_-_complete_edition">Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</a>. Honestly, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>Here's a reminder of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Step into the shoes of seven fan-favorite fighters, each with their own distinct combat style.</p>
<p>- Venture out on epic quests and battle new enemies and bosses across interconnected levels in a new story by series creator Bryan Lee O’Malley that will appeal to longtime fans and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>- Master creative combos, wield wacky weapons, use your surroundings to your advantage and conquer the chaos!</p>
<p>- Spend your hard-earned coins to customize your fighter! Equip special items and upgrade your stats to create a unique build for every playthrough!</p>
<p>- Known for their explosive blend of 8-bit energy and hyper-melodic rock, the band returns to their roots with all new music crafted for this Toronto-hopping adventure.</p>
<p>- Join forces with up to three friends, locally or online, with easy drop-in/drop-out co-op. Battle solo or hit the streets together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Pilgrim EX is currently scheduled to launch on the Switch in 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-voyagers-rebuilds-ship-building-in-massive-6-0-update.1281888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hello Games has just dropped another massive, and of course, free, update for No Man's Sky with the release of its Voyagers update, and version 6.0 of the game that first launched on PC and PS4 all the way back in 2016.</p>



<p>One of the key elements of this new update is how Hello Games has rebuilt the way ship building works in the game, as you can now build completely custom ships that you can walk around in, decorate how you like, filling each of the various rooms with your friends and fellow explorers, and jump out into space from to enjoy the vastness of the universe if you find yourself in a particularly pretty part of space.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Man's Sky Voyagers Trailer (Update 6.0)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>After recently releasing No Man's Sky on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massively-improved-switch-2-version-lets-you-be-a-towns-mayor/">Nintendo Switch 2,</a> Hello Games founder Sean Murray and the rest of the studio have made it clear they're seemingly nowhere done with updates for the game, with Voyagers now No Man's Sky's 39th named update since its historic launch. "<em></em><em>I can’t believe it’s been just over nine years since No Man’s Sky first launched</em>," Murray said in a press release. Frankly, considering how different, yet similar, the game looks, neither can we.</p>



<p>Murray continues by detailing some of what's possible with Voyagers and how players can approach ship building in this new update. "<em>We call them Corvettes, huge ships with hulls, wings, landing gear, cockpits, engine parts, thrusters and more - arranged to your own unique sci-fi design,"</em> he says. "<em>These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters. It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Adding bigger weapons to your Corvette increases your firepower. Add sleeping quarters and a mission radar, and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready to adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team. Or just a window… and suddenly there are these special moments, watching as the universe flies by outside at warp speed.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>He also reminds players, just in case they've forgotten, that all the tech Hello Games is building for No Man's Sky is also being built for <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/">Light No Fire,</a> the next ambitious project from the studio that, instead of giving you a whole universe to explore, will charge you with exploring one large, Earth-sized, detailed planet. It's a whole new kind of challenge, and it is one of the most anticipated titles in the video game landscape.</p>



<p>"<em>I can’t believe that in the past 12 months we released Worlds Part I, Worlds Part II, and Voyagers - all huge changes to this game we care about so much</em>," Murray added. "<em>Many thanks for any support you continue to provide our little game. It really helps us continue to do what we do.</em>"</p>



<p>Voyagers is now available for No Man's Sky players on all platforms.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is one of 2025’s biggest surprise success stories. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has gone on to sell more than </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><span>3.3 million copies</span></a><span> since its launch in April, and is a frontrunner as we head into Game of the Year talks in December. Naturally, Sandfall Interactive is looking to capitalize on all this by making </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>a full-blown franchise rather than a one-off, as director Guillaume Broche has hinted that it has more stories to tell.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4"><span>MrMattyPlays</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>), Broche says that </span><i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>is “not the end” of the series, and that Sandfall Interactive hopes to release more games under the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>umbrella. Whether that means direct sequels to </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> or if Sandfall Interactive decides to go </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>the </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>route</span></a><span> and create an anthology of separate stories remains to be seen.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> is the franchise name,” Broche says. “</span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> franchise.”</span></p> <p><span>If a sequel is set in the same universe as </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, it’s unlikely that it would take place after the original game. Its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>branching endings</span></a><span> leave that world in two markedly different states, and neither of them screams “sequel bait.” Sandfall Interactive might explore any of the other numbered expeditions in a prequel, but we do know how all of those turned out based on the logs they left behind. There’s also the “outside world” storyline that is briefly touched on in Act 3 but never resolved. I’ll stay vague on that one to avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a lot of possibilities for the future of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>.</span></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is an easy contender for that coveted game of the year award, having been received incredibly well by critics and players alike. But as with any breakout success from a brand-new studio, there unfortunately comes an annoying question: What's next? Developer Sandfall Interactive is still staying mostly quiet on that front, but in a recent interview with game director Guillaume Broche, it has been at least confirmed that Expedition 33 will not be the only Clair Obscur game.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to YouTuber MrMattyPlays (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/" rel="nofollow ">TheGamer</a>), Broche explained that "Clair Obscur is the franchise name. Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4ZEP5kjw-w4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Broche played it understandably coy here, as Expedition 33 only came out in April this year. With how long game development takes--and with Broche noting in this interview that he wants to keep the team relatively small going forward--we probably won't know what a potential sequel looks like. The game is quite notably inspired by the Final Fantasy series, which generally takes an anthological approach to its releases, so there are still questions over whether a Clair Obscur sequel would be a direct follow-up, or something new entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're yet to try out the game for yourself, and you're looking for a helping hand in figuring out if it's for you or not, then you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a> for more.</p>

<p>Considering that even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-mobile-now-supports-60-fps-on-some-device/1100-6463504/" data-ref-id="1100-6463504">Fortnite on mobile is supported with 60 FPS</a>, bumping that up to 90 sounds impressive. Even in Destiny 2 for PS5 during Crucible runs, it can reach up to 120fps, but PvE typically drops to 60fps, which still looks great. As for players on Android, it seems it'll be 60fps, but at least the game features full cross-play between all mobile platforms.</p><p>Pre-download will be available today, with the game launching at 9 AM local time across four regional servers: North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.</p><p>Destiny: Rising is the latest installment in the Destiny franchise, expanding upon its well-established universe. Set in a solar system following a major collapse, the game chronicles the ongoing conflict between Guardians and emerging threats tied to a mysterious force known as The Shroud.</p><p>There have been over 10 million players who have pre-registered so far. Players can expect new subclasses, expanded gear customization, and a broader array of missions and world events.</p>

			<p>Kirby has always been a second-string Nintendo property in the West, relatively well known and appreciated, but never on the level of the likes of Mario or Zelda. In recent years, however, the little pink glutton has become far more recognised with the merchandising in particular being ubiquitous. Kirby’s appearances in Smash Bros were a big part of this, but his 3D platforming debut four years ago really put him on the radar. We loved it in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">our original review</a>, with Stefan praising the ‘vibrantly styled decaying world’ and the joy to be had in Kirby’s many transformations. This new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> Edition updates the performance and brings with it a host of new features and levels, but is it worth remembering for those who played the original?</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World – Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2h3bJ8tGrj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, Kirby and the Forgotten Land was already one of the most beautiful games on the Switch. The vivid colours, the visual design, and the variety in environments made it a standout. The Switch 2 version has all that and adds the up-to 4K resolution and performance improvements that are standard with such updates. I noticed no slowdown at all across my playthrough either in handheld or docked modes and the frame rate felt super smooth throughout, jumping from the original 30fps cap to 60fps and with improvements to distant enemy animation rates particularly noticeable. The new levels in the Star Crossed World content are even more visually striking with a crystallised effect transforming the returning environments.</p>


<p>The main added content here is the aforementioned Star Crossed World, a whole new set of levels that runs parallel to the main campaign. I originally played the main game on a different profile so had to restart here as the new levels are added after you beat each boss battle. This results in a drip feed effect that helps keep the new content fresh, but was a little frustrating having to play through the whole game again for this review. Obviously this won’t be the case for most returning players and will work perfectly as intended for newcomers. Having to play the whole story again did help remind me that the Forgotten Land is a pretty lengthy title already!</p>


<p>The Star Crossed World content begins with a mysterious meteor landing on a volcanic island just off the coast of the starting continent. Visiting it shows that a heart-shaped crystal has shattered, revealing a dark and threatening presence within. Kirby has to find all of the scattered pieces, known as Starries, and prevent whatever crashed down from getting loose. These Starries function pretty much identically to the Waddle-Dees from the original game, with some hidden across the levels and others a reward for reaching the end.</p>
<p>The similarity between Waddle-Dees and Starries highlights the fact that this is very much an expansion pack rather than a new game and as such it is worth considering the price. If you’ve already played the original game then £16.99 is not overly expensive for the new content, though it is worth remembering that there is no free upgrade for Nintendo Online subscribers, unlike the two Zelda games, or free performance boost patch. The full retail price is raised to be in line with other first party Switch 2 titles now, but there is plenty of game here for the money.</p>

<p>Alongside the Starries, the Star Crossed World brings several new Copy abilities and some extra secondary content, much of which I’ll leave for you to discover. The Copy abilities are welcome and add to the already stacked roster of skills. Spring Mode helps to increase the verticality of levels, Sign Mode adds in some downhill racing sections, and Gear Mode brings a new aspect to some complex platforming areas. As with all the original modes, however, these are strictly available as setpieces in levels and not freely accessible. Each is necessary to complete the requisite level and mastering them is essential if you want to reach all the secrets.</p>
<p>For completionist players there is a vast amount of optional side content here, with the returning minigames and gatcha unlocks offering almost endless playability. The latter I can take or leave, but there are even more models to collect if that’s your bag. In terms of the minigames these are mostly the same, but there is a new coliseum battle on offer here as well. The bosses throughout Star Crossed World are surprisingly challenging, with the new end fight reaching Dark Souls levels of dodging and counter attacking.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Kirby and the Forgotten Land Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World is the definitive version of one of the Switch’s best games and this game in any form is practically an essential purchase. The new content is well worth the upgrade price too, but if you sold your copy of the Switch version then the full price to return is pretty steep.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This is a bit of a weird one, Ubisoft have sold five of their old games to Atari who will now re-publish them on new platforms. The games are Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. Atari seem to think that money can be made porting them over to the likes of PS5 and Switch 2, something Ubisoft either did not consider or did not think would be profitable.</p>
<p>“Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time,” said Deborah Papiernik, Vice President of New Business. “Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.”</p>


<p>Of those games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/i-am-alive/">I Am Alive</a> may be the most famous as it was in development for seven years and switched developers from Darkworks to Ubisoft Shanghai halfway through that period. Released on PS3 and Xbox 360 the game featured a distinctive colour scheme that was almost all grey. The survival adventure takes place after a cataclysmic disaster that has wiped out most of humanity and reduced cities to rubble, and it was one of the best-selling games of 2012.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Am Alive - Gameplay Trailer (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUfBJrnrPNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cold Fear I had to Google and it’s a 2005 action game which Darkworks also developed. Set on a Russian whaling ship you play as &nbsp;Tom Hansen, a member of the&nbsp;United States Coast Guard, tasked with stop an alien parasite infection before the ship reaches land. That does some vaguely familiar I think I played that on PS2.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/child-of-eden/">Child of Eden</a> was developed by Q Entertainment back when Ubisoft dived head first in to any new hardware release, in this case Kinect and PlayStation Move. The on-the-rails shooter featured trippy visuals and an excellent electronic music score.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grow-home/">Grow Home</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grow-up/">Grow Up,</a> are the most recent titles to be released on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Both feature a robot named B.U.D. (Botanical Utility Droid) in an adveture platformer.</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f0778adde511/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest Switch 2 Edition release is almost here. Ahead of the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</a> *<em>inhales</em>* arriving on consoles tomorrow, the reviews are in... and they're looking pretty strong.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is the same base game as the 2022 3D platformer, with a bunch of new content in the shape of additional 'Star-Crossed' levels, new Mouthful Modes and more. It also makes the most of the Switch 2's boosted power, offering crisp 60fps gameplay, no matter which mode you play.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time with the pink puffball's latest, with the wonderful PJ O'Reilly granting it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">our review</a> and calling it "easily one of the best and most polished 3D platformers on Switch or Switch 2".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186479 @ 1756306908 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with a review out there, so let's check out what some other outlets made of it, to highlight the full range of opinions — even if the options go from 'really good' to 'ever-so-slightly less good'.</p>
<p>Starting at the top, <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-105645-20250827">GAMINGbible</a> opted for a similarly positive 9/10, praising the new levels and the slight increase in challenge that they bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</em> takes an already stellar experience and expands upon almost every aspect that you know and love. A tad more enemy variety would have been nice but it’s hard to see <em>Star-Crossed World</em> as anything other than a must-play experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-review">TechRadar</a> kept the good times going with a 4.5/5 review, giving a shout-out to the creativity of the new levels and the performance boost — even if it believes the visual bump should have come for free:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The added areas in <em>Star Crossed World</em> are some of the best yet, and I’d wager playing the game without them would now make the game feel incomplete in some ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dropping down ever so slightly, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-star-crossed-world/">VGC</a> awarded the game a 4/5, with the outlet enjoying the 12 new stages, though conceding that none of them feel all that revolutionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The increase in resolution and switch to 60fps make it look and feel far more polished than before, and while the 12 new stages are essentially little more than an expansion pack, in this case more of the same thing isn't a negative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition-review/">TheGamer</a> offered a 4/5, giving particular praise to the new Mouthful Modes while wishing there were more of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 edition is the best way to play an already excellent 3D platformer that finally gives the pink protagonist the level of respect he deserves in the genre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review">IGN</a> pivoted a bit lower and awarded Kirby's latest a 7/10, with the review noting that the bonus stages are fun, but not much of a proper expansion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple of cool new enemies, funny Mouthful Mode transformations, and clever ideas put its 12 stages in the top half of the heap overall, but with little beyond that, this comes across less like a proper expansion and more like a DLC level pack to invite you to come back for a weekend.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This is undoubtedly a superior version of Kirby And The Forgotten Land but the problem is that nothing it adds is of any particular significance and £17 is quite a lot for just four hours or so of entertainment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Herman Hulst, once the studio head of Guerilla Games, then president of PlayStation Studios, and now chief executive officer of Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Group, spoke to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">Financial Times (paywalled)</a> about Sony's live service efforts. Following Sony's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-admits-live-service-push-isnt-going-smoothly/">admission of the obvious, that things aren't going great</a>, Hulst says the company is trying to learn from its failures like Concord, adding that if there will be failures, he'd rather they come "<em>early, and cheaply</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I don't want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply,</em>" Hulst said. "<em>We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in many different ways. The advantage of every failure</em> <em>[...] is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is</em>."</p>



<p>When PlayStation first began its live service push that Hulst and former Sony Interactive Entertainmnet boss Jim Ryan championed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/">Sony wanted to have released 10 live service games by March 2026</a>. Not only is that not going to happen, but most of those projects have been cancelled at this point. Regarding that fact, Hulst is seemingly unbothered, saying that the "<em>number of [live services releases] is not so important</em>."</p>



<p>What's more important to him is "<em>having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities,"</em> and a key aspect of achieving that goal for Hulst is making original IPs, like how Concord was a new IP.</p>



<p>"<em>We take a very intentional approach to IP creation […] understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then become a franchise for people beyond gaming."</em> </p>



<p>Concord, as everyone who does not live under a rock and plays video games today knows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">was a massive failure</a> that did not come as "<em>early and cheaply</em>" as Hulst would prefer. Instead, it made it all the way to launch, lived for two weeks, and died a very costly death. Firewalk Studios was shuttered, and it remains a moment in time that PlayStation fans won't soon forget whenever Sony's live service ambitions crop up.</p>



<p>On those ambitions, we recently had a scare that Fairgames, the upcoming live service title from Haven Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">had been cancelled, though that was quickly refuted</a>. Still, it doesn't look great for that game since Haven Studio's founder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/">Jade Raymond, departed the studio</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>Speaking of games that don't look like they're in great shape, Bungie is trying to pick up the pieces of Marathon <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">that weren't plagiarized</a>, after delaying the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">without providing a new release date this past June</a>.</p>



<p>To say things could have been going "<em>smoother</em>" is an understatement. Hulst says that PlayStation is trying to learn from its mistakes, which is a good thing, but learning what went wrong is only half the battle. Actually avoiding the error the next time shows the lesson sunk in, and so far, we've no proof from PlayStation that it has learned the lessons taught by its live service push thus far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2's second month on the market was another explosive one, at least in the U.S., where it surpassed 2 million units sold life-to-date, putting it 75% ahead of the unit sales pace set by the Nintendo Switch 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to monthly data from Circana, whose analysis was shared with IGN by Mat Piscatella. Nintendo Switch 2 sales in July were so strong that July hardware spending reached $384 million, the highest July hardware spend since July 2008. The Switch 2 was the best-selling console for the month of July, and unshockingly is the best-selling console in the U.S. year-to date in terms of both unit and dollar sales, surpassing the PlayStation 5. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is now the best-selling accessory of the year in both dollar and unit sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">Already last month</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 became the fastest-selling game console of all time in the U.S., surpassing the PlayStation 4. When we asked Piscatella at the time if that meant the Switch 2 could outsell the Switch 1, he offered a cautious take:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.<p>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</p></blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the software charts, July was dominated by new releases. EA Sports College Football 26 debuted at No.1 for July and is already the third best-selling game of the year so far in terms of dollar sales. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26, followed it at No.2 for July and No.12 for the year-to-date. Donkey Kong Bananza debuted at No.3 for the month of July and No.20 for the year so far on Circana's rankings, despite Nintendo not sharing digital sales data. And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 debuted at No.4 for the month of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox was also well-represented again on July's monthly charts. Aside from Tony Hawk, Forza Horizon 5 once again made an appearance thanks to its PlayStation release, this time appearing at No.7. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at No.5, and Grounded 2 debuted at No.8. For Grounded 2, its appearance seems largely based on its PC release, as it was the best-selling PC game of the month in dollar sales. However, it's nowhere to be found on Xbox's console rankings, likely due to its Game Pass inclusion and more people choosing to use that subscription for the console version. Microsoft also published four of the top-selling games on both PC (Grounded 2, Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, and Minecraft) and PlayStation (Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, Forza, and Minecraft) this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: Wilds remains the best-selling game of the year so far, and is still followed by the Oblivion remaster. Overall software spending was up 4% year-over-year to $4.5 billion thanks to growth in both mobile and non-mobile subscriptions, offsetting a drop in console software spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Total games spending for the month of July was up 5% year-over-year to $5.1 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">July 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>EA Sports College Football 26 (NEW)</li><li>EA Sports MVP Bundle (2025) (NEW)</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza* (NEW)</li><li>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Grounded 2 (NEW)</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>MLB The Show 25*</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>F1 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It often takes a sequel to unlock an idea’s full potential. Just look at Assassin’s Creed 2, Mass Effect 2, or Batman: Arkham City – games which erased the imperfections of their predecessors and elevated rough diamonds to all-time-classic status. Based on a new demo I played at gamescom 2025, I’m betting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is about to join that club. Obsidian’s first trip across its satirical galaxy back in 2019 had plenty going for it, but often felt constricted in scope or fell flat in its delivery. Those are flaws that a second attempt (plus a nice chunk of change from Microsoft’s wallet) could rectify, and it seems that’s exactly what has happened, if The Outer Worlds 2’s hour-long prologue is anything to go by. Its gleaming polish, branching pathways, and rich role-playing opportunities suggest this is the game I’d hoped the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds">Outer Worlds</a> had been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prologue demo – and thus The Outer Worlds 2 itself – opens on a gorgeous CGI cinematic that introduces the Earth Directorate, a task force that hops around the galaxy taking on corrupt corporations, corrupt governments, and the ultra-corrupt alliances of corporations and governments. More importantly, it is your employer, and your job in all this is to investigate the production of Skip Drives – engines that enable interstellar travel, but rip dangerous holes in the fabric of space with each FTL jump. In this first mission, you’re dispatched to the Arcadian System to infiltrate a lab and work out the Directorate’s next steps in bringing the company behind these hazardous machines to justice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within minutes of landing at the lab’s dock, the prologue offers up a multitude of ways to handle its first problem. Unlocking the bulkhead doors to the lab activates the area’s defences, and now you need to get past a small army of combat robots and automated turrets. You could, of course, shoot your way through them, or drop into a crouch and sneak past them, weaving through their sightlines. But those are just your base, vanilla choices. The Outer Worlds 2 also provides a much more interesting set of opportunities thanks to its RPG foundations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, the security booth in which this escapade begins is the final resting place of Cadet Robin Mowry, and rifling through his pockets will reward you with his personnel ID. When the defenses are triggered, you can phone another cadet working elsewhere in the station, impersonate Mowry, and ask for the defences to be shut down. Your new "colleague" will comply… but only if you can navigate a conversation about “mental refreshment.” You see, Mowry recently underwent a chemical lobotomy as punishment for a work misdemeanor, and so you’ll need to perform your verbal coercion without coming across as ungrateful for your life-correcting treatment. A response enabled by using Speech, one of 12 core skills you can build your character around, is the final key to unlocking a safe route to the lab. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not good with words? Well, maybe you’ve built a character who knows how to breach security software. There’s a service duct that leads out of the security booth and towards the mechanic’s control bay, inside of which you can use the Hack skill to disable the area’s defences. And so, in a single objective alone, I was able to identify four different approaches. This is a prologue, of course, and so they are all easily achieved, but it feels like a statement of intent: each challenge will have multiple methods of approach, with unique pathways catering for a variety of specialised character builds. If Obsidian has been able to deliver on this across the entire length and breadth of the campaign, then that’s something to be very excited about.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The RPG is inherently a pretty good genre for rewarding nosy players willing to look beyond the obvious choices, but The Outer Worlds 2 already feels richer than many of its contemporaries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The approach to choice differed throughout the demo. While that first area was about demonstrating the multiple methods of solving a single problem, later I was presented with quite literally a branching pathway, with each route leading to an area designed to cater to a specific play style. Heading left to Security Ops would take me to a map built around stealth and silent kills, while turning right and progressing through Central Dispatch led to a showcase for conflict and gunplay. I initially opted for the former and soon found myself in an office complex clearly built on the foundational tenets of Deus Ex. Ventilation ducts provided alternate pathways that led to helpful vantage points, while a knife and throwable distraction devices found hidden behind floor panels allowed me to sneakily dispatch the area’s staff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Security Ops’ main pathway is designed to cater to simple stealth mechanics, but poking around revealed further opportunities that were much more enticing than a basic backstab. In one office, I was able to use my Hack skill to obtain a key card for the Pump Room, a locked building that provided an alternative route to my final objective in the Skip Drive lab. Built into the walls of that area was another set of ducts, which not only allowed me to bypass a guard patrol but also led to a set of switches that enabled the building’s automatic turrets, which happily poked holes in my enemies following a single button press. The RPG is inherently a pretty good genre for rewarding nosy players willing to look beyond the obvious choices, but The Outer Worlds 2 already feels richer than many of its contemporaries, especially this early in its campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the original Outer Worlds was never under scrutiny for a lack of role-playing opportunities. It did, however, receive fair criticism for its soft and mushy shooting. Choosing Central Dispatch on a second playthrough of the prologue was an opportunity to see just how far Obsidian has improved its once-damp weapons, and the good news is that the two on offer in this demo – a pistol and rifle pairing with early 1900s detailing – feel fantastic. The pistol is snappy, with a light kick and a satisfying reload, while the repeating rifle packs a much bigger punch at the cost of a long, lever-action cycle between shots. That latter aspect helps cement The Outer Worlds 2’s vintage-futuristic aesthetic, but more importantly demands use of the Tactical Time Dilation Device, which slows time to a crawl so you can more easily score headshots. Back in 2019, this feature admittedly felt like a knock-off of Fallout’s VATS, but with the improved gunfeel of this sequel, TTDD now comes across more like a genuine bullet time system. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 Gameplay - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the stealthy, opportunity-filled Security Ops pathway, Central Dispatch was much more limited with what it had to offer. A conversation with the cadet I had fooled with my impersonation of his colleague at the start of the demo turned sour, and he set a squadron of heavy Dragoon robots on me. This did push the combat intensity a little further, but did not come coupled with any inventive approaches that I could identify. Still, the heavier damage the robots inflicted forced me to repeatedly use the Medical Inhaler – a health kit that builds a toxicity meter with every huff. Max out that gauge and you’re forced to wait a duration until you can use it again. It’s a fun riff on Fallout’s drug addiction system, but one that works as a battle constraint rather than a stat impact. It demands you think tactically about when you ingest those HP-restoring chemicals, and while I imagine it could cause a few frustrating deaths in the fiercest battles, I think it’s at the very least an interesting idea worth experimenting with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m always going to take the sneakier or more creative option when it comes to RPGs, and I’ll admit I had a lot more fun in Security Ops than Central Dispatch. But I will say that those short shootouts convinced me that I’ll actually enjoy it when the guns are drawn, something I can’t say about the original game’s underwhelming combat. Like its fantasy sibling Avowed, much of its newfound punch is down to visual polish, and the same level of detail can be felt across the entire prologue. There are bespoke animations for almost every skill – lockpicking sees your character’s hand align a set of pins on a Mag-Pick, hacking sees you arrange the dials on a Bypass Shunt probe before jamming it into a computer terminal, and applying the Engineering skill to a maintenance panel sees you rub your hands in anticipation before twisting and tightening an arrangement of steampunk valves. It feels expensive, but more importantly it connects and anchors you into this fantastical world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it’s not clear by now, I’m really into what Obsidian is doing with The Outer Worlds 2. The prologue features so many cool opportunities, particularly when it comes to non-combat or combat-adjacent approaches, and I hope that they are all being served up in this opening hour as something of an establishment of the rules – “<em>This </em>is how you can use your character, and similar opportunities await.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I appreciated Obsidian’s prior attempt at this universe, I never totally fell for it, but what the studio has achieved here in this prologue is exactly what I’d hoped for the first time around. And that’s exactly why I’m willing to bet that The Outer Worlds 2 will be one of <em>those </em>sequels. The ones that finally take an idea all the way to greatness. Hopefully, I’ll pass that “prediction” check with a critical success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s “game + add-on” rereleases have been hard to predict based on that label alone. Super Mario 3D World’s jump to Switch 1 came with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Bowser’s Fury</a>, which was essentially an entirely new game, while the more recent Super Mario Party rolled onto Switch 2 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">Jamboree TV expansion</a> that was simultaneously the same as the base game but also totally separate and different in a few odd ways. Now it’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s turn, and its Star-Crossed World add-on is a Kirby-sized gulp of fresh air simply because of how easy it is to explain: it’s just a regular ol’ modestly-sized DLC. It might be packaged as an upgrade, but this small collection of fun new levels isn’t anything more complicated than a good excuse to hop back onto the warp star for a few hours, even if there’s not much to it overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get the boring business talk out of the way first: The only ways to access Star-Crossed World are to either pay $20 to upgrade your Switch 1 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land to the Switch 2 Edition (which also comes with some welcome but inessential performance improvements) or buy the Switch 2 version fresh for $80. You could also buy the Switch 1 version for $60 and skip the added content, but there’s no way to get the Switch 2 enhancements without it. Because those enhancements aren’t very significant, this really does just feel like DLC in a very traditional sense, and as such this review is going to focus on Star-Crossed World alone rather than the bundle it’s being marketed as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other reason that makes the most sense to me is because my review of Kirby and the Forgotten Land still holds up exactly the same as when I wrote it, three-and-a-half years ago. I won’t be recapping the basics here, so I encourage you to go read or watch that review if you’ve never played it (a game I still heartily recommend on its own), and then come back when you are considering the DLC itself. Here is what I said at the time: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star-Crossed World weaves a little side story nicely into Forgotten Land’s existing campaign. Immediately after you complete the first world (or just as soon as you load it up if you already have a save beyond that), a mysterious meteor crashes into the ocean and sends chunks of blue crystal all across the map. The story, which is not the reason you are here at all, is predictably thin as a Waddle Dee with a cool beret sends you out to collect the “Starries” that have been scattered across the land in order to reseal the evil being inside the meteor that is <em>prophecized to end all existence.</em> Ya know, normal Kirby stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What that means, practically speaking, is that 12 new “Starry Stages” have been added to the map, two in each of the six worlds from the base game. These borrow locations and themes from the levels they are next to, adding crystal flowers that alter the landscape when you touch them. There are also some brand-new enemies, challenges, and even awesome background songs. I was initially concerned that these stages would <em>just</em> be remixes, but that proved not to be the case – they are made up of almost entirely new areas, and the handful of times you do revisit spots like in the excellent mall level or exciting amusement park, it feels entertainingly referential rather than like a cheap rehash. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There aren’t really any misses across the 12 new Starry Stages.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren’t really any misses across these dozen dungeons, with clever twists put on existing mechanics and plenty of interesting new ones to tease your brain. One standout had me hopping between moving platforms that were coming toward the screen, frantically trying to find the right path to the next one before getting pushed off the edge. Another revisits the very silly “pipe” Mouthful Mode transformation to send you rolling down a roller coaster track that you need to reveal extra pieces of in real time. None of them put up too serious of a fight, since this <em>is</em> a Kirby game, but they are a bit more challenging than the rest of Forbidden Land across the board, making them a nice additional “post-game” option to keep you playing, even though they actually unlock in tandem with the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mouthful transformations, there are three new ones introduced in Star-Crossed World: a spring that lets you bounce up high and then slam down hard, a gear that allows you to roll along walls, and a sign that essentially turns Kirby into a sled for a few high-speed downhill sections. All of them are used to great effect, opening the door to some clever new puzzle ideas – I particularly liked how you’re asked to launch yourself between separated sections of wall as the gear, which is a little bit more mechanically nuanced than I expected from such a simple item. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the existing transformations are revisited in smart ways as well, with options like the stalwart traffic cone getting multiple sections that prove there is more than a little gas left in the tanks. Even the stairs transformation, which in the main game I thought was… well, pretty dumb, is actually used in interesting ways here: there’s a short section where you have to leave your stairs on a moving conveyor belt then hop up elsewhere to complete a task before it falls off a ledge. Neat! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Kirby’s more traditional transformations didn’t get the same attention – there are no new ones and no new upgrades for any of the existing set. Perhaps more importantly, if you have already beaten Forgotten Land and are returning to this DLC years later like I did, having a maxed-out toolset already can make some of the beefed-up enemies a bit too easy to shred. One new enemy type in particular acts as a fun little recurring miniboss, calling down meteors that you have to dodge as you break away progressive layers of crystal armor – but a charged-up attack from a fully upgraded copy ability can trivialize that otherwise-interesting encounter from the jump. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby and the Forgotten Land: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In that same vein, the failures of Star-Crossed World are less about what it does and more about what it doesn’t. It took me about three hours to finish what’s here, and while the stages themselves are all top notch, it feels slight as an actual expansion beyond that. There are no boss fights across those 12 levels, no new Treasure Road bonus stages (which were a big highlight of the original) even for the new Mouthful options, and nothing really changes back at your Waddle Dee village – although there is a little bit more to see beyond the Starry Stages that I can’t get into here. Even the new star-based currency you collect became fairly uninteresting once I realized that its <em>only</em> use was unlocking a new set of gacha figurines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not like there’s nothing worthwhile here, and it’s not like I got 100% completion across those 12 stages right away – just like the base game, I didn’t usually make it to the end with every single collectible on my first try, so there’s plenty more secrets left for me to sniff out. But Star-Crossed World can’t help but feel like a drop in the bucket when you compare it to everything that was already available. The levels it adds are great, but that single afternoon of fresh platforming is pretty close to the entire package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition changes don’t do much to entice you, either. You’ll no longer see NPCs in the distance moving at comically low frame rates, but that’s the only change that really jumped out at me. Don’t get me wrong, the higher FPS and resolution are welcome, and it all looks quite nice… but it didn’t really look bad to begin with. Forgotten Land was such a stylized game already, one without any of the real performance issues other Switch 1 games were able to fix in the jump to Switch 2, so the ceiling on how much better it could look without a more substantial overhaul wasn’t too high in my eyes. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>It has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/the-outer-worlds-review-fall-deeply-into-the-best-fallout-like-game-in-years/">nearly six years now</a> since <em>The Outer Worlds</em> threw players into the deep end, forcing them to acclimate to the game's far-future, ultra-corporate intergalactic dystopia amid lots of <em>Fallout</em>-style shooting and questing. The prologue for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>—which I got to play as part of a preview build ahead of the game's planned October 29 launch—throws players into a different kind of deep end, asking them to fill the shoes of an agent in the storied semi-militarized police force of the Earth Directorate.</p>
<p>The over-the-top propaganda that leads the game off suggests the Earth Directorate is here to protect colonists from out-of-control corporations and tyrannical governments. But your first mission goes in a different direction, sending you on a secret mission to the "out of jurisdiction" Arcadian system, a secretive dictatorship where all the skip drives that power interstellar travel are supposedly manufactured. You've been asked to help expropriate a rare, "unsealed" skip drive core, which can then be opened up, studied, and maybe even copied without the risk of catastrophic explosion (the "right to repair" folks in the audience might be nodding their heads sagely at this point).</p>
<h2>Choose your choice</h2>
<p>I won't spoil things by discussing just how the mission goes off the rails or talking about the somewhat vague twist that closes out the playable prologue. But I will gush a bit about how the first game's mix of retro-futuristic set-dressing and sardonic, cynical writing style immediately shine through, even with the change in perspective. A mix of strong voice acting and motion capture immediately drew me back into the <em>Outer Worlds</em> universe, even when the characters were delivering ridiculous lines like "You’re not just a cog in the machine. You’re THE cog!"</p>

<p>Before you set out, you can customize your character's look and background, down to a wide variety of fetching prosthetic limbs. Instead of the explicit D&amp;D-style attribute points from the first game, though, the sequel lets you choose instead from a selection of broad skills and traits (both positive and negative) that offer percentage-based modifiers to everything from base health and melee damage to companion ability charge time.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is pretty up front about showing you how these choices matter in more than just a statistical sense. A malfunctioning door early in the game can be opened directly by a "brawny" character's strength or an engineer's ingenuity, for instance, while everyone else has to figure out a way to crawl around the problem through some nearby ductwork. And while UI tooltips note which traits you need for many choices, certain gameplay paths and options at points seem completely hidden from characters without the right traits.</p>

      </figure>

<p>The sequel's early moments also seem to go out of their way to craft custom lines for NPCs to fit your chosen background, in ways I didn't really notice until I replayed the prologue with different characters. When I played an agent with a "Heroic" background, for instance, my mission briefing focused on how important the skip drive was to "the imposition of righteousness" throughout the galaxy. My "Professor" character (described in game as an Indiana Jones-style "full contact archaeologist) got sold on the "propagation of knowledge" the drive enables.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Then there's the way the game stresses a number of early dialogue choices, telling you how your fellow agents will remember when you choose to treat them with eager support or stern rebuke at key moments. Without getting too much into early game spoilers, I'll say that the medium-term consequences of these kinds of decisions are not always obvious; concerned players might want to keep a few save files handy for gaming out the "best" outcomes from their choices.</p>
<h2>Bang bang</h2>
<p>The early moment-to-moment gameplay in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be broadly familiar to those who played the original game, right down to the Tactical Time Dilation device that slows down enemies enough for you to line up a perfect headshot (though not enough for <em>Max Payne-</em>style acrobatics, unfortunately). But I did find myself missing the first game's zippy double-jump-style dodging system, which doesn't seem to be available in the prologue of the sequel, at least.</p>

      </figure>

<p>The game's first action setpiece lets you explicitly choose whether to go in guns blazing or focus on stealth and sneak attacks, but characters that invest in conversational skills might find they're able to talk their way past some of the early encounters. When it comes time to engage in a firefight, thus far I've found the "Normal" difficulty to be laughably easy, while the "Hard" difficulty is a bit too punishing, making me wish for more fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The prologue stops before I was able to engage with important elements like the leveling system or the allied computer-controlled companions, making it a rather incomplete picture of the full game. Still, it was enough to whet my appetite for what seems set to be another tongue-in-cheek take on the space adventure genre.</p>
