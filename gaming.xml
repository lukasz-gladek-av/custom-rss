            <p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has snuffed out reports that a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> movie is the "next" video game to get a silver screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Sweeney was responding to a tweet from movie industry insider Daniel "DanielRPK" Richtman, who'd suggested in a since-deleted post that whilst some studios had already "passed" on a Fortnite movie, the recent success of game-to-film adaptations like A Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. Movie meant a Fortnite movie was likely to be "next".</p>

<p>"You just know Fortnite is next," Richtman wrote in the deleted tweet. "There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now."</p>
<p>Sweeney shot down the speculation with a succinct "False".</p> <div>

<p>Despite trying to clarify which specific part of the statement was incorrect, at the time of writing, Sweeney has yet to respond to Richtman's follow-up tweet (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epic-games-ceo-fortnite-movie-response-video-game-adaptations/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Sweeney wouldn't be blamed for considering it, though; earlier today, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie has generated $301m worldwide</a> - that's £233m - on its opening weekend. That's the biggest US domestic debut of any video game movie adaptation ever, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m).</p>

<p>Whilst characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl have previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins, this latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan, as well as his infamous baseball bat, Lucille. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Gatekeeper expansion is also now available. This one includes five new Survivors with unique perks and five new Killers with 10 "hauntingly-detailed miniature figurines" to customise your experience.</p>
<p>As for the video game itself? Most recently, developer Behaviour Interactive confirmed Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">would be yanked from sale on 4th April</a>.</p>
<p>As explained in Behaviour's announcement earlier this month, he's only retreating from digital storefronts - existing owners can continue playing with him after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC would be possible. Behaviour didn't explain why the DLC was being removed from sale, but as Matt posited at the time, the answer is almost certainly licensing-related.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-turn-based-tactics-game-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Tom Henderson revealed that Ubisoft is developing a turn-based tactics game set in the world of Rainbow Six Siege. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the report</a>, this game is expected to launch in 2026 or 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and 'possibly' Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Henderson's sources mentioned that it will feel a lot like XCOM, albeit with more cinematic cutscenes and the like. Players will select operators with different skill sets based on the current mission. The campaign is said to last between 25 and 30 hours, though that could change since the development is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of the most successful Ubisoft games in the last decade, and it's still being updated, so it's not surprising that the publisher is doubling down on the IP. It was also handpicked alongside Far Cry and Assassin's Creed to be handled separately as part of the new subsidiary that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> recently with the financial help of Tencent.</p>
<p>In a couple of months, Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be overhauled</a> with X, a new version featuring improved graphics and new gameplay elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>

<p>"Minecraft hardly needs a film in the first place - it's already a phenomenon, a Pandora's Box, an essential formative aspect of the childhoods of millions of people around the world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We never thought we’d see a battle pass or traditional season structure in Escape from Tarkov – and we’re kind of <strong>still not. </strong>But Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the session-based multiplayer arena shooter, is getting a battle pass system along with cosmetics and skins soon. On social media, Battlestate Games has spent the past couple of days teasing just that.</p>



<p>In a new post on Twitter, players are given a glimpse at the CQCM Mask, a favourite item amongst the game’s W-key spamming Chads, with a <strong>custom skin</strong>.</p>



<p>It starts with Arena – will it bleed into Escape from Tarkov proper?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-geared-up">Geared Up</h2>



<p>The <strong>free </strong>battle pass that’s coming to Escape from Tarkov: Arena is expected to behave exactly as you’d imagine. It’ll reward players with exclusive items, skins, and boosts in exchange for cold, hard XP grinds. The more you play, the more you’ll unlock.</p>



<p>That’s right, I said it’s <strong>free</strong>. That was something confirmed by Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov two days ago.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena isn’t free – you need to pay for that as it’s a spin-off from the core extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post on social media that revealed a snippet of the CQCM skin:</p>











<p>Players are now wondering how any crossover impact will ripple throughout the wider Escape from Tarkov ecosystem. Will there be a linking function allowing users to run their skins and cosmetics in Escape from Tarkov’s extraction shooter platform? I, for one, hope so. I’ve wanted to customise my gear more in Tarkov for the longest time.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov uses a ‘wipe’ pattern that typically involves resetting the game once every six months. That could easily pivot to a season structure equipped with a battle pass of sorts, but it would need BSG to pack it with content for it to be interesting. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/">takes months to add a single gun</a> to the game, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask that probably won’t be delivered.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to skins and a battle pass coming to Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments, or check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98a-minecraft-movie%E2%80%99-made-301-million-during-its-opening-weekend.1156581/</guid>

<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening weekend for a video game movie with a staggering $301 million.</p>



<p>The movie completely shattered analysts predictions, who forecasted that movie would only generate $70-$80 million domestically in its opening weekend – A Minecraft Movie hit $157 million opening domestically and $144 million overseas for a global start of $301 million.</p>



<p>Domestically, at $157 million for its opening weekend now puts A Minecraft Movie as the biggest day one and weekend video game adaption, passing the previous record set by The Super Mario Bros. Movie at $146.4 million domestically over three days. A small caveat is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie released on a Wednesday, but even so earned $204 million by Sunday.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the highest-grossing movie during the opening weekend for any film releases in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s success means that the movie has already become highly profitable, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs, so it wouldn’t be too surprising to see if a sequel is already being planned.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>It’s numbers become even more impressive after new leaks online show that a version of the film is already circulating online in its entirety, meaning that piracy has already become a huge issue for the blockbuster title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-7-biggest-surprises<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">New video game hardware announcements can become somewhat predictable. With each new generation of consoles you can expect to see near-certain staples like better graphics, faster load times, and new takes on beloved, plumber-and-turtle-oriented franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Nintendo, which has done this consistently across several generations, from the N64 analog controller, tiny GameCube discs, wacky Wii motion controls and Virtual Console, the Wii U tablet screen, and the Switch’s built-in portability, has delivered these improvements with the Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But being Nintendo, the company again unveiled a few genuine shockers during the Switch 2 Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's 2025 and we finally get online play.</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was four years old in 1983, my babysitter used to roll footballs at me like Donkey Kong rolling barrels at Mario. I would jump over them, making a Donkey Kong sound effect in the air, then grab a toy hammer and smash them like Mario. That’s how long I’ve been a Nintendo fan. So I say this from a place of long-suffering experience: it’s going to be impossible to talk about this awesome reveal without revealing a little loving bitterness. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo, as we all know, does not really play online well. Satellaview and Metroid Prime: Hunters aside, Nintendo has barely scraped the surface of what’s possible with a unified multiplayer platform like those created by Sony and Xbox. It’s never as easy to find and talk with friends on a Nintendo platform. Even the Switch required a separate app for voice chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shockingly, change appears to be here now. During the Direct, Nintendo unveiled GameChat, and it looks... really neat?! It's a four-player chat that supports noise suppression, video cameras for showing friends’ faces, and screen sharing across consoles, allowing you to keep an eye on up to four different displays inside a single screen. We know from the new Switch 2 accessibility features page that GameChat also supports text-to-voice and voice-to-text, allowing players to communicate multiple ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we haven’t seen what, if any, unified matchmaking interface might tie into this just yet. But it’s already a big step, and I’m hoping it means the last nail in the coffin for the abominable friend code forever. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Miyazaki is bringing new blood exclusively to Nintendo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When I saw the first frames of this trailer, I thought I was seeing Bloodborne 2. The ambiance, the character design, and the environments all screamed the FROM Software house style. Thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods"><u>Eric Van Allen at IGN</u></a>, I now know that I was watching footage from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-7-things-we-learned-from-nintendos-interview-with-director-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Duskbloods, a multiplayer PvPvE game </a>designed by the softly-smiling monarch of video game masochism, Hidetaka Miyazaki. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I do not know where this man found time to direct a Nintendo-exclusive game. I’m starting to think that he may never leave his office nor sleep, much like one of his own confused, hollowed characters wasting away in the high tower of some gothic prison. But I’m grateful. FROM doesn’t really miss anymore, so I’m anticipating a tasty treat.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of people who need a vacation, apparently Super Smash Bros. director Masuhiro Sakurai has moved on from Smash to a new Kirby game? Did not see that coming. Get that man a nap!  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Kirby's Air Ride was, to put it bluntly, a pleasant-looking but aggressively unfun Kirby racer for GameCube. But Sakurai has made no secret of his deep affinity for Nintendo’s round, pink elder god, and it’s practically a certainty that a Sakurai-helmed take on the franchise will be a far more refined and enjoyable experience. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Control issues</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost a throwaway moment, but the Pro Controller 2 sounds genuinely Pro this time around when Nintendo announced the Pro Controller 2 has an audio jack now, which is another feature that’s welcome about a decade later. More importantly, they’ve added two mappable extra buttons. I LOVE customizable buttons, so this tiny surprise actually tickled me pink. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Mario?!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This one genuinely shocked me. Near as I can tell, a lot of Nintendo’s Mario makers have been locked up in a secret bunker for years working on his next 3D adventure, which I assumed would be the big summer game for Switch. I was very wrong. Turns out the Odyssey team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview"><u>is the force behind Donkey Kong Bananza</u></a>, the captivating new 3D platformer with a focus on destructible environments. Nintendo is once again playing against expectations as it so often does, trusting hardcore fans to flock to Donkey Kong’s biggest game in generations and saving Mario for another day.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch will also launch with extensive third party support and Mario Kart World. While World looks like a system-seller, I figured it would be timed as a Christmas-window family game. Nintendo usually leans on Mario, Zelda, or both to sell to their biggest fans during a console’s first year. But Nintendo is looking at Mario Kart 8’s record sales with confidence, betting their most popular party game, alongside Bananza, will help move enough Switch 2 units to make launch a success.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon x Nintendo was not on my bingo card</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world Mario Kart is here, whether it be for good or for ill. I’m betting on good, as the zany physics, weird vehicles, and combat mechanics of Mario Kart should lend themselves well to navigating between and across tracks battling friends and sewing chaos. The short look we got seems to indicate a continuous world a la Bowser’s Fury, but much larger and supporting myriad drivers. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s very expensive</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-price-of-the-switch-2-overshadow-its-reveal">The Switch 2 costs too much.</a> I get that everything is expensive right now, as tariffs go up, the yen goes down, and American inflation reignites. But $449.99 USD is a hefty price by any standard, and Switch 2 is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-does-switch-2s-price-compare-to-the-cost-of-other-nintendo-consoles-at-launch-spoiler-its-not-the-most-expensive">most expensive launch in Nintendo’s 40-plus US sales history</a>. In fact, Switch 2 costs $150 dollars more than its predecessor’s launch price, and is $100 dollars more than the next-most-expensive Wii U. Successful Nintendo consoles and handhelds have often relied on lower prices as a differentiator, but Switch 2 will be looking to succeed without a price advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch may be remembered as much for repopularizing portable gaming as it will for a hardware issue that affected millions of gamers: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">joystick drift</a>.</p><p>Drifting is the most common term for an issue where joysticks detect false inputs — even when no one is touching a controller — causing unwanted movements to happen in a game. The issue also affects controllers from Sony, Microsoft, and third-party accessory makers.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect sensors</a> emerged a few years ago as a potential solution to the problem, but there’s an even better option out there that’s easier to retrofit into existing controller designs. That solution is tunneling magnetoresistance, or TMR, a technology that revolutionized hard drives two decades ago using quantum mechanics and magnets.</p><p>Like Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors avoid the fundamental problem with more traditional joysticks: their sensors wear down as a matter of their design. The controllers that ship with the last few Xbox consoles, the PS4 and PS5, and the Switch are all built around sensors like this — potentiometers, a component that can be used to change or measure electrical resistance.</p><div><p>Solid objects rubbing against each other isn’t an ideal approach to longevity</p></div><p>As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/48944/heres-why-ps5-joysticks-drift-and-why-theyll-only-get-worse">iFixit explained in 2021</a>, inside the two potentiometers that are used to detect up-and-down and side-to-side movements in each joystick is a semicircular strip of carbon film with terminals at each end that pass an electrical current through it. As the joystick is moved, a component called a wiper slides back and forth along this strip, measuring the voltage where it makes contact. Since the voltage predictably changes across the length of the strip, the wiper’s voltage measurements can be used to accurately measure the movements of a joystick.</p><p>But solid objects rubbing against each other isn’t an ideal approach to longevity. That strip of carbon film inside a joystick’s potentiometer can wear down over time, affecting the flow of current and the accuracy of voltage measurements. Dirt on the film, either from moving components wearing down or dust and food crumbs finding their way inside a controller, can also contribute to inaccurate measurement and drift.</p><p>That’s why controller manufacturers are now turning to sensors that don’t rely on components rubbing together: Hall effect and TMR, both of which rely on magnetism instead. As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Hall-Effect_Joysticks">iFixit explains</a>, Hall effect joysticks replace resistive strips and wipers with magnets and sensors that never make contact, using a phenomenon first discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.</p><p>Inside a Hall effect sensor is a conductive material called a “Hall element” that has an electrical current flowing through it. Normally, electrons flow straight through this conductor, but the presence of a magnetic field can interfere and divert the electrons to either side, like an invisible obstacle diverting the flow of water in a stream. As the magnet attached to the joystick moves closer and farther away, the Hall effect sensor measures the resulting voltage changes in the conductor. Those measurements are translated into movements in a game with more accuracy and reliability than you get with potentiometers, and without any wear and tear.</p><p>Hall effect sensors have been in use for over 50 years — and were even used by Sega in the Saturn 3D and Dreamcast’s controllers that debuted in the mid-’90s. GuliKit repopularized the use of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279435/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-android-hall-effect">Hall effect sensors in gaming hardware</a> after debuting a controller with it at E3 2021. But they’re still not widely used in gaming hardware because potentiometer-based joysticks are cheaper to manufacture. They also have higher power demands, which is something controller manufacturers need to account for.</p><div><p>What makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn’t the tunneling itself</p></div><p>The solution for that may be TMR sensors, which come out of more recent discoveries. In 1988, physicists Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg independently discovered a phenomenon called the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR), which earned them both the Nobel Prize for physics in 2007. They found that the presence of a magnetic field applied to ultra-thin films made up of a conductor — such as copper or aluminum just a few nanometers thick — sandwiched between two magnetic materials would affect the direction of spin of electrons and their ability to easily flow from one side of the film to the other.</p><p>“If you put two magnets right next to each other… very close to each other with a spacer material, if the magnets on this one have a spin A and the same spin is on the other one, it’s easy for the electrons to move to the next one. But if the other one has a misaligned spin… the electrons want to move, but there’s no easy way to move the other electrons as well, and that causes a change of resistance,” Riyan Mendonsa, senior staff engineer at Seagate, explained to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>TMR works in a very similar way to GMR. The presence of a magnetic field aligns the spin direction of electrons, making it easier for them to flow from one side to the other. But while GMR uses a conductive material sandwiched between two magnetic layers, TMR, counterintuitively, uses an insulating material that acts as a deliberate barrier.</p><p>To flow from one side of the film to the other, electrons rely on a quantum mechanical phenomenon called quantum tunneling to pass through that in-between insulator. The idea of particles passing through a barrier they shouldn’t be able to is not easy to wrap your head around, but it can happen when certain materials — such as aluminum or magnesium oxide — are just a few atoms thick. And thanks to physicists like Erwin Schrödinger, the phenomenon isn’t a complete mystery. We have equations that can accurately predict when it will occur.</p><p>What makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn’t the tunneling itself. It’s that adding and removing a magnetic field produces a measurable change in resistance. For years, hard drives relied on read heads with a design similar to the wire coils used in speakers and microphones, according to Mendonsa. In 2005, Seagate adopted TMR technology in read heads, which could not only be made much smaller but also were far more sensitive at detecting the presence of a magnetic field.</p><div><p>“TMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors.”</p></div><p>This allowed the magnetic bits on hard drives to also be made much smaller, dramatically increasing the density and storage capacities of 2.5-inch drives to 120GB. Various forms of TMR technology are expected to still be used in hard drive manufacturing for years to come.</p><p>Although the underlying science is different, Hall effect and TMR sensors can both be used to detect a joystick’s movements through the use of non-contact magnets, but TMR sensors have some key advantages.</p><p>“TMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors,” says Jack He, GuliKit’s business director. That could allow for the use of smaller magnets, making TMR joysticks easier to manufacture. But leveraging the higher sensitivity for improved joystick accuracy will depend on manufacturers and the hardware they use. “The resolution mainly depends on the sampling precision of the backend MCU, and is not closely related to the joystick itself,” says He.</p><p>Compared to Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors typically have lower power consumption, but the advantage there isn’t improved battery life. “The original design of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo game controllers uses traditional resistive film joystick technology with a constant power supply design, with a power capacity limited to about 1 mA,” He says. Hall sensors can consume anywhere from 0.5mA to up to 2mA of power, while TMR sensors only consume between 0.1mA and 0.3mA. This allows joysticks with TMR sensors to be installed on current controller hardware “as a perfect 1:1 replacement without any other circuit modifications.” That could help speed up adoption and bring down the price of the technology by simplifying manufacturing.</p><p>TMR sensors also offer more performance stability over a wider temperature range — an advantage that’s especially useful for a product often being gripped by warm hands for several hours.</p><div><p>Although the TMR technology hasn’t yet been adopted by companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony, there are several third-party manufacturers already selling gamepads with TMR joysticks, including <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/collections/crush-controller">PB Tails’ Crush controller</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24262029/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-switch-pc-ios-android-steam">GameSir’s Tarantula Pro</a>, and 8BitDo, which uses it in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">new Ultimate 2 controller</a>. In 2024, GuliKit was the first company to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">release upgrade kits bringing the TMR technology</a> to PS5, PS4, Xbox, and Switch controllers.</p></div><p>But it will still be a few years for TMR technology to become mainstream in gaming hardware. “TMR sensors are often more expensive than traditional Hall effect sensors, especially in smaller volumes,” He points out. “However, as TMR technology matures, the cost difference is expected to decrease.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1%E2%80%99s-next-update-is-scheduled-to-release-tomorrow-here%E2%80%99s-what%E2%80%99s-in-it.1156539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1’s sole developer, Tyler, has said that the next update for Schedule 1 is scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>In an update on X, Tyler said that the “next update is almost ready to go” and is set to be fully released on Monday. Its said that the next update in Schedule 1 will include boutique store, a pawnshop, wall decorations, and “some other fancy stuff.”</p>



<p>However, Tyler’s most recent update (which came at the time of writing) said that the v0.3.4 open beta is “taking a bit longer than expected”, and will release first thing in the morning. For those unaware, Tyler is from Australia, so players should expect the BETA update to come sometime in the afternoon for east coast players and later at night for those in the UK.</p>



<p>Schedule 1 has proven to be a massive success for the games single developer, going on to achieve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">414,000 concurrent players</a>, with that number likely to be smashed later today.</p>



<p>It’s success hasn’t come without its issues, though, as the developer is now reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing IP copyright issues and is currently being investigated for infringement</a>. As for what those issues are remains to be seen, but the developer is yet to comment on the matter.</p>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website&nbsp;<a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a>&nbsp;featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now.1156497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76 was released in 2018 to a paltry reception. It was a shell of a game, boasting a bleak open-world environment (even for an apocalyptic game), and ultimately, Bethesda Game Studios had fallen short of its promises for this overly ambitious game. </p>



<p>It was an enormous change to the well-established Fallout formula to introduce an MMORPG to the scene, and five years after its launch, plenty of potential players and uninformed gamers still wonder if Fallout 76 is good now.</p>



<p>Let’s break into a snapshot list and break down the reasons why Fallout 76<em> </em><strong>is </strong>good now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-76-good-now">Is Fallout 76 Good Now?</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 has experienced a lengthy turnaround that has lasted half a decade, and it just keeps on going today. With countless changes having been made to the platform and dozens of updates having been applied, it’s not the same game that it was when it was released in 2018.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-it-has-content-now-and-npcs">1. It Has Content Now – and NPCs!</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Back in the day, Fallout 76 launched with very little content – it almost lacked a core campaign, it was devoid of any NPCs, and overall, it felt dead and bland. Now, following several sizeable updates, Fallout 76 is more of a living, breathing game, and it has had several lengthy questlines, factions, and some large settlements injected into the core of it.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has worked hard to keep up the content stream in Fallout 76, expanding the map and adding new world events, quest branches, and endgame activities, such as running caravans, fishing, and participating in C.A.M.P. build contests.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-it-takes-you-outside-the-map">2. It Takes You Outside The Map</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It started with The Pitt – an ‘Expedition’ that takes players back to Fallout 3’s ‘The Pitt’ expansion. In this Expedition, players are charged with flying hundreds of miles in a ‘Vertibird’ to take on missions outside of the base map – and that’s a concept that Bethesda Game Studios is expanding on over time.</p>



<p>After that, the team introduced Atlantic City, another out-of-the-map expansion that players enjoyed quite nicely. It was after <strong>that </strong>that the team at BGS started expanding the core map of Appalachia, many years after the game hit the market.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dev-diary-expands-on-fallout-atlantic-city"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-dev-diary-atlantic-city/">Dev Diary Expands on Fallout: Atlantic City</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-3-it-has-heaps-of-lore">3. It Has Heaps of Lore</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a canonical title and pumped full of the lore that Fallout fans the world over both know and love. From the cryptids to the mysterious wrongdoings of Vault-Tec, and from the iconic factions to a whole new host of mutated enemies, there’s a lot of lore and backstory to soak up in Fallout 76. </p>



<p>There are several events referenced in the game that have a huge impact on the complete timeline for the series.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-it-s-still-fantastic-with-friends">4. It’s Still Fantastic With Friends</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Admittedly, there are still thousands of Fallout fans who’ll say that Fallout 76 ‘isn’t a real Fallout game’ because it’s a multiplayer-only title, but that’s the beauty of it. It’s still remarkable to be able to venture out into this post-apocalyptic, mutated landscape, fight enormous creatures, loot buildings that are hundreds of years old, and complete entire questlines with your friends by your side. </p>



<p>It’s quite a unique experience, and going by the numbers preached by Bethesda Game Studios, it’s a popular one at that.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-it-s-more-resilient">5. It’s More Resilient</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Back before Fallout 76 was given any real attention, it was rather buggy and quite a chore to play. However, thanks to BGS pouring resources into the game’s development – which has included reaching out to third-party studios to give a little support – Fallout 76 offers up a much cleaner, resilient experience today. </p>



<p>It’s a visually pleasing game that manages to edge out Fallout 4 – especially when it comes to vistas – and despite being an always-online game, it’s rare that any network issues are present.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-truthfully-it-s-all-they-ve-got">6. Truthfully, It’s All They’ve Got</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Frankly, Fallout 76 is good now because Bethesda Game Studios has probably realised that this is it for the foreseeable future. There are no other Fallout games in development, and Fallout 5 – the ‘one-pager’ game – likely won’t be released for around another decade or so. </p>



<p>This ‘live service’ model is perfect for Bethesda, as it means the firm can simply keep updating it as time goes on, adding in more content, more questlines, fresh Expeditions, and more ways to experience the post-apocalyptic wasteland with your friends.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-is-developing-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-rainbow-6-universe.1156485/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft is developing a new turn-based tactics game set in the same universe as Rainbow 6 Siege.</p>



<p>It was said that the new Rainbow 6 Siege game is likely one or two years out, but is aiming to be released as a current-generation console title for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PC, and possibly Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Two sources, who have knowledge of the game said that the camera is a top-down view somewhat similar to Diablo 4 or XCOM and would see the player take control of Rainbow Six Siege operators. One source said, “just watch some XCOM gameplay if you want to get an idea, I’d say it’s an updated version of that with cinematic cutscenes and so on.”</p>



<p>It’s gameplay loop was said to be similar to Rainbow 6 Siege in a lot of ways, where the players would have to select different operators based on their skills to raid buildings, save hostages, etc. </p>



<p>The total time of the game was said to be aiming for approximately 25-30 hours depending on player skill, but that could change if gameplay content, cinematics, etc. are cut, it was said.</p>



<p>Although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current plan for Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent</a> is currently up in the air, some staff working on the project said that it could move to the new business as it falls under the Rainbow Six IP, while others said they currently did not know.</p>



<p>Rainbow 6 is one of Ubisoft’s biggest IPs, with Rainbow Six Siege surpassing well over 50 million players. The last mainline title in the series, though, Rainbow 6 Extraction, failed to meet Ubisoft’s internal expectations and support was quietly removed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-fires-back-youtube-age-restriction/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-creator-fires-back-at-youtube-age-restricting-videos-of-the-game.1156455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-fires-back-youtube-age-restriction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Balatro has been targeted once again on account of it being <strong>kind of </strong>related to gambling. YouTube has started putting age restrictions on Balatro videos, according to one creator, and the game’s sole developer, LocalThunk, has fired back at the Google-owned platform.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. In February, LocalThunk was successful in an appeal to PEGI to get Balatro’s age rating reduced from 18 to 12.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-deja-vu">Dejá vu</h2>



<p>On social media, LocalThunk clapped back at YouTube for putting age restrictions on Balatro content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apparently Balatro videos are being rated 18+ on YouTube now for gambling </p>



<p>Good thing we are protecting children from knowing what a 4 of a kind is and letting them watch CS case opening videos instead</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments came after this video was posted online by ‘Balatro University’:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Balatro is now 18+ on YouTube." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnhNLWKEbSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a recent change to the site’s terms of service, YouTube tweaked the rules for creators, stressing that ‘depications or promotions of online casino sites of apps’ are now subject to age restrictions.</p>



<p>Balatro is based entirely around building decks of cards and earning chips to defeat your opponents, but the act of chasing down poker hands is as close as it gets to gambling. It’s a connection, but a minute one that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-luck-be-a-landlord-win-pegi-ratings-appeals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even PEGI was able to overlook</a>.</p>



<p>It seems as though LocalThunk will need to go back on the warpath, this time against Google and YouTube, to potentially rectify this issue. It’s possible that some kind of AI-driven solution was employed to scan the platform and put an age restriction on content that matched a certain model, hence, Balatro got caught by the algorithm.</p>



<p>Have you played Balatro yet? Let me know what you think about the game in the comments.</p>

<p>Last night in the Call of Duty League, Toronto Ultra was forced to give up a series against Boston Breach because of server issues that caused them to ‘rubber band’ all over the map. During the round of Control on Vault, the team was visibly enraged on the face cams, and following a <span>long technical revi</span>ew, the match was chalked.</p>



<p>The team took to social media following the loss, with JoeDeceives especially getting vocal about dealing with this ‘time and time again’ and suggesting that, despite complaints, <strong>nothing ever changes</strong> with the League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-is-hilarious">‘This is Hilarious’</h2>



<p>After a break of around 30 minutes midway through Control on Vault, Toronto Ultra threw in the towel against Boston Breach, giving them the win with a 2-0 scoreline. Ultra has enjoyed some solid results in recent weeks, including a dominant win over Atlanta FaZe just one day before this debacle.</p>



<p>JoeDeceives summed up the situation perfectly on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>after all the bullshit we’ve (and other teams) been thru with online servers we are not doing that shit again with how bad we are rubber banding, ggs boston play lat next week.</p>



<p>we’ve brought it up to the league time and time again and nothing ever changes, if anything the responses get worse. this is hilarious</p>



<p>Had my own coach recording my pov from behind me and they still don’t believe us, fucking hilarious they have integrity cams behind us to see all of ours povs and they don’t do anything with it just a useless camera behind us for fun</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tempers flared as other pro players came out and made their accusations:</p>



<div><article><p><span>This is what happens when you use Exit Lag</span></p></article></div>







<p>Toronto Ultra’s next fixture will be against the LA Thieves on April 13 – hopefully, the network issues will be resolved by then.</p>

Also, it’s an ideal, ready-to-race package that will rev the engines of anybody who dreams less of shaving PBs on a track and more about shredding POS cars in Wreckfest 2.</p>That’s pretty much what I decided to throw my Moza R3 at. I took a lovely, metal-twisting holiday away from my usual MO of testing Direct Drive wheels with hypercars and perfect lines. Was that an unorthodox test bed? Kinda. But I maintain that the Wreckfest series is a low-barrier gateway racer that can create serious rally addicts eventually. <p data-cy="paragraph">Better than that, though, it’s just big gobs of fun with physics a-go-go and punchy force feedback aplenty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the 3.9Nm thrumming in this wheelbase doesn’t exactly redline with its peak power, it’s still a solid and stylish DD unit that hums along like a finely tuned machine. Unlike its clunkier, noisier gear-and-belt-driven rivals at the entry level, the R3 is whisper-quiet and ridiculously compact in comparison. Better yet, the bundle is extremely mod-friendly, so upgrading your ride down the road is a cinch—no need to swap out the whole chassis.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Moza R3 PC Bundle – Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Moza R3 – Design and Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is a full-throttle, plug-and-play racing system.

Believe you me, you’re going to need that last bit of kit once the FFB gets going. Nothing jerry-rigged or half-arsed is going to hold this sucker down when the cars start cartwheeling.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said clamp is made entirely of steel and is rigid as hell—quite sturdier than the plastic alternatives, and it has a generous 50mm of clamp space. Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money. Thanks to a beefy desk and a straightforward system of four mount holes to secure the R3 wheelbase, this setup holds up well under the stresses of force feedback. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Weighing in at just 2.29 kilos and measuring a compact 120mm high, 135mm wide, and only 93mm long (excluding the steering shaft), the R3 is a pocket rocket of a wheelbase. Its boxy, industrial design gives it a serious motorsport aesthetic—far more race-ready-looking than some of the older, plastic clamshells that are out there competing.</p><div catalogid="bc8e4b87-8511-42d5-b60f-ad814276dea7" id="218220"><div id="218220" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MOZA R3 Bundle for PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also like that the ports on the back are neatly arranged for easy access, with slots for pedals, a dash display, a shifter, a handbrake, and even an emergency stop device. Out of the box, the only one you’ll need is the pedal port, but expansion is as easy as adding aftermarket mods to a project car. There are also two threaded holes up top for mounting Moza’s dash display.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wheel-wise, the one you’re getting default here is a comfy D-shape affair with a grippy polyurethane wrapping. I like the feel of the clicky, short-throw paddle shifters that are crafted from sturdy black metal. And I dig that Moza allows for some customisation here—the brushed metal wheel rim is removable, and alternative rims are available to better serve your race discipline of choice.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/06/screenshot-526-1743902518354.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Size comparison between the R3 (top) and R9 wheelbases.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading below the equator, we have the R3’s pedal set, which is only an accelerator and a brake. If you’re searching for a clutch experience—and that’d make perfect sense for OG muscle cars in Wreckfest 2—you can make an extra pit lane purchase of a third pedal. Prices seem to be reasonable for that, and I know from experience that Moza’s ecosystem is all about easy installation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, these metal pedals feel a heck of a lot more robust than some of the plastic-heavy alternatives on the market. Resistance comes from springs rather than a load cell, so while they’re not championship-grade, they should be more than enough for entry-level sim racers. There’s also a surprising degree of adjustability, with pedal pads that can be repositioned higher or lower, and the entire pedal units can be moved left or right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Moza R3 x Wreckfest 2: Performance</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>With 3.9 Nm of peak torque, the R3 isn’t exactly a torque monster, but it’s right in the slipstream of other entry-level contenders with similar price pricepoints. It’s also perfect for some low-stakes, throw-around fun in a physics-heavy (yet nonetheless arcade-y) title like Wreckfest 2.</p><p>I’m not going to lie to you, though; I did need to do some tinkering to make Wreckfest 2 speak correctly with the R3, at least initially. However, thanks to the ever-changing landscape of Early Access, a few hotfixes meant I no longer had to constantly rebind/reverse my pedals in Moza’s (usually quite capable) Pit House software. Everything works pretty much as it should now, and, obviously, support will only get better as yet more fixes roll out.</p></div><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/wreckfest-2-early-access-blog-1742971666798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pictured: things rolling out that will <em>definitely need fixes</em>.</figcaption></figure></output></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>The R3’s FFB feels wonderful when you laterally thunk into other cars—typically when you’re using “dodgem cars” cornering logic to pinball past an apex while pinging some competitor off into a tree. Likewise, the feelings you get through the wheel when you’re on the receiving end of such tactics and are forced to shred through some random fence or tyre pile are nice and visceral.</p><p>Car-nage collisions aside, I’d also be remiss if I didn’t highlight how satisfying a stretch of clean racing can be—that basic yet intimate FFB conversation between balding tyres and terra firma. Obviously, with Wreckfest 2 having closer DNA to a rally experience than a staid, single-surface track racer, every lap can (literally) feel like a series of plot twists. You’d better believe your hands will notice the difference when you drift in and out of bitumen to gravel to mud and back again.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and it goes without saying that any time there’s a momentary lull in any and all force feedback followed by a wrist-rattling jolt, that is just…well, a chef’s kiss experience. I can furnish you with two memorable examples of this. One, whenever you get some sick Dukes of Hazzard air and land on something you shouldn't have. And two, reversing from a bad corner upset, flicking into neutral, and then getting utterly and unexpectedly blindsided by some AI trying to break the<em> land speedbump record through you</em>.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incidentally, I would like to say that POV racing in Wreckfest 2 with a decent FFB wheel such as this is the rough racing equivalent of a mini horror game. With your peripherals increasingly blinkered by the cabin of a crumpling car, every race is basically a series of untelegraphed jump scares that reach out and grab you through this wheel. Obviously this “driving on eggshells” sensation becomes more pronounced when you’re engaged in an actual demolition derby event, and some bastard has just bent your bonnet up over 80% of your windscreen.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/wreckfest2earlyaccessreleasedatetrailer-ign-blogroll-1738679001752.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tis but a scratch. It'll buff right out.</figcaption></figure></output></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>I honestly shudder to think what those unexpected crashes will feel like for any gamer gripping a Moza R12 or higher. Those impacts you’ll get with 12 or 16 Nm worth of grunt will surely be the stuff of warning label justification. Hell, even a surprise bash through the 3.9 Nm force of the R3 delivers a respectable hand rattle. As unthinkable as it may sound, you may actually find yourself turning it down.</p><p>All that being said, multiplying the Moza R3 Bundle with the Early Access antics of Wreckfest 2 is one of the funnest things I’ve done all year thus far. Even as a proud owner of a Moza R12 wheelbase and pretty much every fancy add-on that comes with it, I was impressed by the performance and value proposition of this younger brother bundle. If you have budget aspirations of joining the simming scene—or you just wanna <em>feel</em> stuff crash harder than a stock market after tariffs—I say turn the key on an R3.</p></div><p> Adam Mathew is our Aussie deals wrangler.

            <p>
Right, anybody fancy a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> update? Well, it's not ready just yet, but developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/deep-field-games">Deep Field Games</a> did share a look at the game's upcoming Cold Fusion update that looks like it'll be a beefy one. As you can probably guess by the title of the update, there's a bit of a chill coming, specifically in a new area called the Residence Sector. This new locale has "something" going on that's making it a bit too cold for anyone to hang out in, though the mystery behind it is something you'll likely have to play to discover.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Then there's the new upgrade system that'll come with this update. Once you reach a certain tier you'll be able to build a new station that'll let you improve your weapons, armour, "and a few other item types", which sounds like it'll make certain instances in the game a little less stressful. It also seems like you'll be able to reset your character, and the room you do it in definitely doesn't look cold and unwelcoming.
</p>
<p>
One big thing that will be changing is base assaults, because as Deep Field Games put it, they "kinda stink." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543352686106378315?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing the update explains that while portal storms are generally working as intended, there are "several cases, mostly non-Pest related assaults, where they will simply spawn inside your base or in the same spot over and over." As a result of this, some big changes have been made to how bases are detected, and Deep Field Games are hoping that assaults should feel "a lot more unique and varied."
</p>
<p>
On the smaller end of new additions in the update, and possibly my favourite of everything that's coming with it, is the fact that bins can be used as bins. Got something you don't want? Just chuck it in there! Gotta love it when a game has tiny little functions like this.
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when this update will arrive just yet, so we'll all just have to keep our eyes peeled in the meantime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/05/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-too-expensive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has spun the gaming world around this week, with excitement and joy mixed in with gasps of exasperation. Why the exasperation? Well, it’s partly because of the price. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is set to be the most expensive Nintendo hardware of all time, coming in at £395.99/$449.99/€469.99 for the console itself, or £429.99 / $449.99 /€509.99 for a bundle with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the reaction from certain parts of the internet and the wider world, it’s clear that people were hoping for it to be closer to the price of the original Switch, but there’s a variety of reasons why it’s not. In further bad news for price-sensitive gamers in the US, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-delayed-due-to-tariffs-but-release-still-set-for-june/">it might actually get worse</a>.</p>

<p>As a starting point, we need to talk about inflation. Inflation, rather than just being for balloons, is an economic effect wrapped up in the tracking of increases in average prices. They look at general goods – milk, bread, etc. – and see how much they were in the same month last year, with the percentage increase setting the inflation figure for that month. Inflation in the UK is 3% while it’s 2.8% in the US, so a pint of milk costs 3% more now than it did in April last year, and that impact is felt much stronger when compared over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>What drives inflation? This isn’t the place for an essay on economics, but increases to wages are the main driver, as this then affects every business and service, who then put their prices up to maintain their own growth and profits. So, in basic terms for milk’s case, the farm hands’ wages increase, the delivery drivers’ wages increase, the factory workers that package the milk wages increase, and then the workers in the shop that sell the milk wages increase. The result? The price of milk goes up.</p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that the price of things generally goes up. Electronics have often defied that upward trend over the past few decades, but the world-changing events of the last five years has put paid to that.&nbsp;On a baseline level, we shouldn’t expect the Switch 2 to cost the same price as the original Switch, which launched at £279.99/$299.99/€329.99 eight years ago – £280 in 2017 is now £367, when adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>On top of that, this is a wholly improved console. While we don’t know the specifics of the chipset or RAM yet, it’s clearly a much more powerful device, capable of running titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, along with the addition of a larger 7.9″ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, improved Joy-Con 2, 256GB storage, new microphone and chat functionality and an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">impressively useful mouse mode</a>. The Switch 2 is a natural and clear evolution of one of the most successful consoles of all time.</p>

<p>Alongside those technical improvements, the handheld landscape has changed in the past seven years, with the rise of Valve’s Steam Deck, and Windows portables like the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. While we can’t be sure of the Switch 2’s hardware, it seems to be more proficient than the current Steam Deck model, which starts at £349 in the UK, with a lower resolution and plainer 60Hz LCD screen, and where you’d have to then buy a separate £69 dock for TV play, and some kind of controller on top of that.</p>
<p>Where the Steam Deck has the clear edge is on game pricing. Steam, and PC gaming in general, has always had lower software costs, and that’s emphasised here with Nintendo making bumping up the price of their top tier games to £66.99/€79.99 for digital versions of games like Mario Kart World, while physical copies are even more expensive again at £75. Nintendo are far from the only company to have increased prices in the last few years. £70 is now the baseline for an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed</a>, an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC</a>, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Call of Duty</a>, and Nintendo are loosely matching that, and Sony has been all-in on double-dipping with PS5 remasters with paid upgrades from PS4, which Nintendo is now following with their Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Game prices languished in a £50-60 region for a long, long time, even if it often didn’t feel like that thanks to retailers like Amazon, supermarkets and others often chopping the price of games after a couple months or even a few weeks, and with deep cuts that we always eagerly await during sales. Even Game Pass and PlayStation Plus have changed the perceived value of games. We’ve been living in a golden age where you could likely afford, and gain access to, a heap of games to play – probably more than you physically have time for – but this might be another indication that it’s coming to an end.</p>
<p>By splitting the pricing, though, this is a clear push to get people to go digital. You can spin that as cutting out the cost of producing a physical cartridge, or note it as a shrewd way to disincentivise the second hand market.</p>
<p>All of this is made worse by the stagnation of wages, which, while increasing, haven’t kept in line with inflation. Fundamentally, you can afford less than you used to. Does it suck? Yes, and the increase of game pricing is a huge burden for people in this hobby, but those blaming Nintendo for all of this need to turn their attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s business model has always been not to lose money on their consoles and that’s clearly a policy that’s worked, when other manufacturers like Sega have fallen by the wayside. The increased price for the console and its games are nonetheless a bitter pill to swallow, especially when everything else in the world is also going up, from your weekly shopping to a pint down the pub.</p>
<p>US gamers will soon have to think about another thing on top of all that: tariffs. Donald Trump has gone to economic war with the rest of the world, placing or increasing tariffs on imports into North America. That’s caused such a huge wave in the global economy that Nintendo have postponed Switch 2 pre-orders in that territory. The genuine outcome could be that the Switch 2, and its physical games, cost even more than the announced price, and gamers are the ones who’ll likely end up out of pocket. This will affect PlayStation, Xbox and PC gamers just as much.</p>
<p>So, will I be getting a Switch 2? Yes. It feels like a natural competitor to the Steam Deck, and the pricing is in line with that. Nintendo also make amazing games that you can’t play elsewhere, and while I think the price of Mario Kart World is steep, the amount of playtime I’ll get out of it with my family and friends will still make it a sound investment. I totally understand anyone who isn’t going to make that jump quite yet. It hasn’t dimmed my excitement for a system that’s been talked and hypothesised about for a long time, but for some, it makes a Switch 2 a real luxury, and as a luxury it might not be as essential as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Will you be nabbing a Switch 2? Or do you think the prices too high?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>is, at the time of this publication, in pre-release, and with each clan getting its own preconstructed deck, we thought it only made sense to take a look at each one with some&nbsp;<em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> commander deck reviews. Unlike past commander deck overviews we've done like with Aetherdrift's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Aetherdrift Commander: Living Energy Review and Upgrades">Living Energy</a>, these are focused just on reviews, and not on upgrades as well.</p>

<h2>Jeskai Strikers Review</h2>

<p>The latest Spellslinger Commander preconstructed deck, Jeskai Strikers has plenty of potential power for <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Magic: The Gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> spellcasters everywhere.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jeskai-strikers-commanders.jpg?itok=LyMbDa_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jeskai-strikers-commanders.jpg?itok=uMPKy6QA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Its commander options are <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/7/shiko-and-narset-unified" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shiko and Narset, Unified">Shiko and Narset, Unified</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/2/elsha-threefold-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elsha, Threefold Mentor">Elsha, Threefold Mentor</a>, each of which wants the deck to go in somewhat different ways. Shiko and Narset want a mixture of cheap spells and larger payoffs that target to maximize the return from its ability, which doesn't require a focus on instants and sorceries unlike many cards like it. Meanwhile, Eisha wants lots of small spells and voltron type inclusions so that the number of tokens can be maximized, and then exploited by playing spells to pump them all.</p>

<p>There are two standouts in the new cards. Starting with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/40/will-of-the-jeskai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Jeskai">Will of the Jeskai</a> it is both a <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Wheel_effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wheel Effect in Magic: The Gathering">wheel</a> and a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/105/past-in-flames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Past in Flames">Past in Flames</a> effect for a lot of value in spellslinger and combo decks. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/16/tempest-technique" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tempest Technique">Tempest Technique</a> is the other allstar having the Storm Mechanic on it, and its pump getting exponentially larger as you get more of it on a creature.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jeskai-strikers-will-of-the-jeskai-and-tempest-technique.jpg?itok=ZEsL5HWQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jeskai-strikers-will-of-the-jeskai-and-tempest-technique.jpg?itok=D8q0IT6k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for reprint value, it’s a bit weak in the area. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/92/narsets-reversal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Narset's Reversal">Narset’s Reversal</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/157/lier-disciple-of-the-drowned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lier, Disciple of the Drowned">Lier, Disciple of the Drowned </a>lead a number of $5-$10 cards but the deck lacks a $10+ marquee reprint in it.</p>

<p>While lacking the raw power of last year’s Quick Draw Jeskai Strikers hit most of the expected marks for a spellslinger deck. Its largest flaw is how it is pulled in a few directions, which can show up in hiccups in gameplay, but provides lines in how to improve it. Others may also regret that it doesn’t significantly innovate on the spellslinger archetype in any way.</p>

<h2>Mardu Surge Review</h2>

<p>The Mardu clan take center stage with Mardu Surge, an aggressive WBR deck capturing the relentless spirit of the spirit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mardu-surge-commanders.jpg?itok=6o1LcKf1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mardu-surge-commanders.jpg?itok=79FPzpPp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/10/zurgo-stormrender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zurgo Stormrender">Zurgo Stormrender</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/6/neriv-crackling-vanguard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Neriv, Crackling Vanguard">Neriv, Crackling Vanguard</a>, the deck features a pair of aggressive aristocrats commanders. Zurgo makes you a token each attack, and provides payoffs when you kill tokens in the form of cards, or damage. Meanwhile, Neriv comes with bodies, and provides card draw that rewards the range of different tokens in the deck. Both synergize well, and work together, for an aggressive, token heavy plan.</p>

<p>Among the new cards two stand out to me quite clearly. The first is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/11/ainok-strike-leader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ainok Strike Leader">Ainok Strike Leader</a>, a bear who when it or your commander attack it creates a 1/1 goblin attacking each opponent. Beyond that 5 power attack force for 2 mana, it can also sacrifice to give your creature tokens indestructible for a turn, making it quite a powerful and flexible creature. The other one is this deck’s inclusion in the powerful Will cycle with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/17/will-of-the-mardu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Mardu">Will of the Mardu</a>. This one can serve almost as a pseudo-fog by giving you one creature for each an opponent of your choice has, while also being an army in a box. It pairs that with a burn for each creature you control to an opponent.</p>

Previously only printed in Streets of New Capenna Commander, this instant protects your creatures, and creates an army. It’s joined by some other solid value cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/181/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor</a>, and a number of other cards in the $5-$9 range.</p>

<p>Mardu Surge is a powerful go-wide deck with a lot of strong cards, and synergy in it. While it can, of course, be improved, out of the box this deck is worth buying both from a value and playability standpoint.</p>

<h2>Sultai Arisen Review</h2>

<p>Rise from the grave, or at least otherwise interact with there is the plan for the Sultai Arisen preconstructed deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultai-arisen-commanders.jpg?itok=E16-Nbzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultai-arisen-commanders.jpg?itok=dvrS0Mzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sultai Arisen’s commanders are a tale of two stories in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/5/kotis-sibsig-champion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kotis, Sibsig Champion">Kotis, Sibsig Champion</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/8/teval-the-balanced-scale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Teval, The Balanced Scale">Teval, the Balanced Scale</a>. Kotis is not a particularly interesting commander, as it’s an ability we’ve seen before, and better. The escape-esq cost of exiling cards to escape is notable, and the growing isn’t enough to redeem it. On the other hand, Teval is fire, and should be moved right into the command zone. A solid 4/4 for 4 flying, it mills 3 on attack, getting you a land back, and anytime you grab something from your grave, you get a zombie token. There’s a lot of things to do with the dragon, and it’s no surprise he’s an early leader for one of the most popular commanders.</p>

<p>Sultai Arisen’s new cards are tied to graveyard mechanics as you would expect. To highlight two cards I call attention to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/25/afterlife-from-the-loam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Afterlife from the Loam">Afterlife from the Loam</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/28/tevals-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Teval's Judgment">Teval’s Judgment</a>. Afterlife from the Loam can cost only BBB (with Delve 5) and gets you the best creature from each player’s graveyard. While that’s a powerful reanimator spell, Teval’s Judgment is a strong value piece for decks that want to play out of their graveyard, giving mana, cards, and creatures for doing so.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultai-arisen-afterlife-from-the-loam-and-tevals-judgment.jpg?itok=OmXIPajQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultai-arisen-afterlife-from-the-loam-and-tevals-judgment.jpg?itok=gOrdUe8M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are some solid reprints in the deck in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/192/ob-nixilis-the-fallen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ob Nixilis, The Fallen">Ob Nixilis, The Fallen</a> running over $15, and being a strong card. It’s joined by a series of $10ish reprints like the classic <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/96/life-from-the-loam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Life from the Loam">Life from the Loam</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/176/dauthi-voidwalker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dauthi Voidwalker">Dauthi Voidwalker</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/295/lord-of-extinction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lord of Extinction">Lord of Extinction</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/352/command-beacon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Command Beacon">Command Beacon</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/354/crypt-of-agadeem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Crypt of Agadeem ">Crypt of Agadeem </a>to give the deck a solid monetary value.</p>

<p>Overall Sultai Arisen brings a new marquee commander option in Teval, Balanced Scale, and provides a lot of useful cards for graveyard based decks in Sultai colors. It plays a bit lumpy, and its curve needs some smoothing, but there’s no denying the power here.</p>

<h2>Abzan Armor Review</h2>

<p>The tough Abzan come to play with a deck that’s all about toughness and making use of that toughness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abzan-armor-commanders.jpg?itok=MNvSdvy6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abzan-armor-commanders.jpg?itok=DBcPrFUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Commander options here are very split with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/4/felothar-the-steadfast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Felothar the Steadfast">Felothar the Steadfast</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/1/betor-ancestors-voice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Betor, Ancestor’s Voice">Betor, Ancestor’s Voice</a>. Felothar the Steadfast is a new toughness matters commander who allows defenders to attack, and will compete for one of the top spots in that archetype with Arcades, the Strategist due to it also having an explosive card draw ability. Betor, Ancestor’s Voice isn’t really fit to lead the deck - while an interesting commander, the deck lacks the life gain and loss support that it really needs to work.</p>

<p>Abzan’s new cards are weaker overall than many of the others I feel. That’s not to say though that you shouldn’t be interested in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/31/will-of-the-abzan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Abzan">Will of the Abzan </a>as a strictly better <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/187/zombify" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zombify">Zombify</a> with upside, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/27/jaws-of-defeat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jaws of Defeat">Jaws of Defeat</a> will become an archetype staple for toughness matters decks. The new cards here are pretty narrow though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abzan-armor-will-of-the-abzan-and-jaws-of-defeat.jpg?itok=4RMdpi2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abzan-armor-will-of-the-abzan-and-jaws-of-defeat.jpg?itok=v6UITLip 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Reprint wise the deck is led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/286/dragonlord-dromoka" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dragonlord Dromoka">Dragonlord Dromoka</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/268/seedborn-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Seedborn Muse">Seedborn Muse</a>, with the former often around $15, and the latter a green staple typically over $10. Other than those though, reprints here are very narrow like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/336/weathered-sentinels" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Weathered Sentinels">Weathered Sentinels</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/121/indomitable-ancients" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Indomitable Ancients">Indomitable Ancients</a>, or often not particularly desirable like the inevitable <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/142/zetalpa-primal-dawn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zetalpha, Primal Dawn">Zetalpha, Primal Dawn</a> printing.</p>

<p>I like some of what is going on in Abzan Armor, but the attempt to graft in a life-loss/life-gain theme with Betor and some of the cards interferes with the deck. It’s also light on card draw, relying on Felothar to carry that, making it fragile if it needs to restock.</p>

<h2>Temur Roar Review</h2>

<p>RAWR! Dragons Go RAWR! That in a nutshell encapsulated the Temur deck, as one of the most dragon forward decks we’ve ever seen from Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temur-roar-commanders.jpg?itok=SXMnWvLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temur-roar-commanders.jpg?itok=IL1K8Ot_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Led by your choice of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/3/eshki-temurs-roar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Eshki, Temur’s Roar ">Eshki, Temur’s Roar </a>or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/9/ureni-of-the-unwritten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ureni of the Unwritten">Ureni of the Unwritten</a>, you can see the focus here is on big creatures coming down fast. Eshki is a bit awkward as there are only a few creatures with power 6 or more to get the most from her ability. Ureni of the Unwritten is the more specific dragon focused commander and has a powerful ability that should have you put it in charge of this deck.</p>

<p>There are a fair number of new cards, including those from the main set. Exclusive to the Commander Deck I want to highlight <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/44/broodcaller-scourge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Broodcaller Scourge">Broodcaller Scourge</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/38/thundermane-dragon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thundermane Dragon">Thundermane Dragon</a>. The Broodcaller Scourge lets you cash in on the damage you’re doing with new permanents, synergizing particularly well with the <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=dragonstorm+set%3ATDM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dragonstorms">Dragonstorms </a>(especially <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/101/breaching-dragonstorm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Breaching Dragonstorm">Breaching Dragonstorm</a>) to get a lot of value out of your attack. Helping get you there is Thundermane Dragon, who lets you play creatures with power 4 or more from the top of your deck, and gives them haste.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temur-roar-broodcaller-scourge-and-thundermane-dragon.jpg?itok=VXfoQpUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temur-roar-broodcaller-scourge-and-thundermane-dragon.jpg?itok=CNS5mgUZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Temur Roar really stands out in terms of reprint value. The inclusion of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/218/hellkite-courser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hellkite Courser">Hellkite Courser</a>, a $20 card in its own right, is already a boon, but it’s accompanied by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/226/nogi-draco-zealot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nogi, Draco-Zealot">Nogi, Draco-Zealot </a>in that same price range due to previous scarcity. This is the first reprinting for Nogi since its very limited printing in Game Night 3, and the only non-foil version. They are joined by a number of other useful dragon related cards, and solid reprints, giving the deck the best monetary value of the bunch.</p>

<p>Temur Roar may not be a great Temur clan deck, but it is a good dragon pre-con. Become like Sarkhan Vol, and worship the dragons with this deck, and toss in whatever other dragons you have with it.</p>

<hr><p>What do you think is the best commander deck from the bunch?

            <p>
You know, I've always loved me a sky island in a video game. Can't really tell you why, I just think they're neat! So right from the get go I was pretty easily won over by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a>, another one of those open world survival crafting type games. It's a genre I'm not easily won over by, I don't care for building things all that much, but the pull of the open air is pretty alluring to me. And I won't even have very long to see if I'll bounce off of its craftiness or not, because developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bossa-studios">Bossa Studios</a> announced today that Lost Skies is releasing into early access later this month on April 18th.
</p>

<p>
Being one of those kinds of games, there's the usual kinds of things you can expect in terms of building things, though the main thing you'll be building is your skyship. It looks pretty intricate too, lots of different parts you can attach and wiggle around. You can then take your ship out on large scale dogfights, which look a bit intimidating to be honest, but I'm sure a seasoned enough crew will be fine.

Speaking of your crew, you can play with up to five friends (or enemies, I suppose, that just doesn't sound very fun) as you explore the game's first region, the Outskirts. Future updates will apparently expand this area, as well as add in more places to explore, alongside general bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and a few additional features.
</p>
<p>
One thing I quite like is the game's Island Creator, which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/">already download separately</a>. This is exactly what it sounds like, you can build and design your own islands, and in the main game you'll be able to download islands other people have made. Honestly this looks like enough of a game in its own right, kudos to Bossa Studios for fitting something like this in.
</p>
<p>
If you're not an early access person, Bossa Studios said they are currently planning to release it into 1.0 sometime this year, but otherwise, you can check it out April 18th.

<p>Hours ago, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that ‘talk of a Fortnite movie’ that was originally passed on would be rethought given the success of Minecraft, which is enjoying the highest opening weekend <strong>ever </strong>for a video game movie.</p>



<p>It wasn’t too long after the claim had surfaced on Twitter (X) that it was shot down unceremoniously with a single word from the CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nope">Nope.</h2>



<p>In a now-deleted post on Twitter, DanielRPK wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You just know Fortnite is next. There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interjected with a single word</a> reply: ‘False.’</p>



<p>DanielRPK has since <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1908582823256338548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">followed up</a> by addressing Sweeney directly, asking whether it’s true that Sony ‘passed on the opportunity to make a Fortnite movie a few years ago.’ Sweeney has yet to respond to this comment at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Minecraft has turned heads this weekend, scoring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a record of $58 million</a> on its first day at the box office. This has defied expectations, with many thinking the film would bomb because of it starring Jack Black and looking bizarre in early impressions and previews. </p>



<p>In recent years, live-action adaptations of video games have soared. The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us have dominated the charts and won prestigious awards, becoming known as some of the top titles in the space to make it to the silver screen.</p>



<p>It appears that Fortnite isn’t one of the games that’s set to get a movie adaptation any time soon, though.</p>



<p>Do you think Fortnite would work as a movie? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
