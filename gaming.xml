<p>As shared by company CEO Akihiro Hino on <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1991399440079552852">X</a>, Victory Road has already surpassed 500,000 sales worldwide. Sure, this is across <em>all</em> platforms (including PS4, PS5, Xbox Series and Steam), but that's no mean feat for a title that has been this long in the making.</p>
<p>"We will leverage the strengths of a download-only title to make the game even more enjoyable and add new content," Hino wrote in the accompanying tweet (via Google Translate), "so please look forward to it!".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owkmhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>And new content <em>is</em> inbound, it seems. In the blog post marking the sales milestone on the <a href="https://www.inazuma.jp/victory-road/topics/251120/">Inazuma Eleven website</a>, Level-5 mentions that it will be adding new "Galaxy", "Scales of Ares" and "Seal of Orion" routes (presumably based on the anime series of the same name) to the game's throwback Chronicle Mode, as well as an online tournament and additional free content in the future too.</p>
<p>We'll have our full review of Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road with you before long, so keep an eye out for that one!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With the Barbarians knocking at the gates, I’m sure that the Romans despaired at their lack of foresight in not building their great cities on wheels. Had they done that? Well, they could just roll off into the distance and away from those that menaced them. That’s pretty much the plan in Monsters Are Coming! Rock and Road, with the world beset by hordes of shadowy creatures and the distant promise of sanctuary at the Arch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Right from the opening moments, it’s clear that Rock and Road is a fun mash-‘em-up of roguelite, bullet heaven and tower defence. You start with the core building of your city, trundling downwards toward safety as monsters spawn around you, and a black fog follows. As the hero peon, you have to scurry around nearby, gathering wood, stone and gold while also chipping in with some of the defensive effort.</p>


<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, those resources don’t actually pay for city upgrades and new buildings in the moment. Wood increases the speed of your towers firing, stone repairs damage, and gold can be spent on buildings and upgrades at safe zones, but the main way you’ll earn buildings is through levelling up and getting a choice of three buildings to place. That comes from gathering the experience gems dropped by fallen monsters and levelling up.</p>


<p>There’s more of the Vampire Survivors structure and gameplay feel to this game than it appears on the surface. Your hero also controls in that bullet heaven fashion, so you just move them around and they’ll automatically attack nearby enemies and harvest from scenery that you push them into, gathering a long snake of resources that you need to then lead back and deposit at your city. That’s the point that everything is banked, often levelling you up in a single go early on, and kicking you into the building screen.</p>
<p>This is where it starts to feel like tower defence. Your city sits in the centre of a square grid, and you can build out from that point. Each building takes up just a single square, and doesn’t have to be adjacent to another building, just in line with one, so you can immediately start to strategise with your building placement. Shorter-ranged turrets can go to the edges, longer-ranged mortars and ballistae more centrally, and then minion generators, stat farms and special buffing buildings nearby. Given the direction of travel, it’s easy to load up the rear of your city, but that can hurt you when waves of enemies spawn from the front and sides, so you do often need a multi-sided approach. I’ve repeatedly leant into having a skinny column, which helps with the need to clear scenery that your city can get stuck on and be vulnerable.</p>

<p>You can get adjacency bonuses –&nbsp;there’s a really helpful +50% damage building that wants to be central to a bunch of towers, while stat farms give 5% boosts by default and an additional +1% for each one in a chain. It’s fun trying to get boosts and synergies to work together, like leaning in on having minions and then a turret that gains 10% damage for every minion currently alive, or a building that makes fire deal 50% bonus damage to frozen enemies.</p>
<p>In a typical roguelite fashion, you need to roll with what the game randomly offers you. You pick from 10 cities to start with, and that can bring some fundamental changes –&nbsp;a left-to-right mirror city that doubles your buildings, a city where XP comes from harvesting not enemies –&nbsp;and Hard difficulty on each biome starts to add further challenges, so you might have an initial plan, but if the unlocks given to you are all for fire and ice, instead of minions or gold generation, and you don’t have the cash to re-roll the options then you’ll have to pivot. The handful of safe zone checkpoints also give you a chance to adjust or enhance without pressure, giving you a choice of new weapons for your hero, a chance to get a stash of resources and the shop to sink all of your cash into.</p>
<p>The overarching progression naturally brings you new cities to play with (luring you into these different playstyles), and unlocks more buildings that broadens the options you might be presented. Even if you fail, each run also generates overarching progression points, largely depending on how far you’ve travelled, which you then spend to give percentage boosts to various city and hero traits. Success, however, immortalises that first city in the Arch, piecing together a new sanctuary and giving a little script about each one’s method.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciate about Rock and Road is how bitesized each run can be, coming in at under 30 minutes, with the spaces between checkpoints ramping up the pressure and building up to a randomised Kaiju-sized boss. They’ll generally just walk around your city alongside throngs of other enemies, while you scamper around and try to undo their abilities. One can make itself invulnerable by attaching to scenery that you need to destroy, another is a big spider queen where you need to race to destroy globs of enemies they spawn, and more.</p>
<p>Should you defeat them, it’s then a straight run to safety, and there’s a lot of joy to seeing the mass of arrows coming down from the Arch’s defensive walls, while your city fends off the chasing horde. But then that’s the end. You don’t roll through to the next biome and even greater challenges; your city is consigned to history and you start a new run. That makes it feel like you’ve seen all that the game has to offer by the time you’ve bested the standard difficulty – which I’d say isn’t that great a challenge. Playing on Hard is a big leap and requires that progression grind and more experimentation, but I feel this as a more casual option, compared to the more compulsive roguelites out there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Powered by NVIDIA technology, Nintendo Switch 2 games can leverage RTX tech like<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/"> NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing </a>to deliver better visuals and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">enhanced image quality at solid performance.</a> Since launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/">Nintendo's own titles had yet to take advantage of either,</a> but it seems like the ray tracing floodgates have been opened by the publisher's latest first-party title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>As confirmed by a screenshot of the game's license readme found in the Nintendo Switch 2's menu <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-is-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-support-ray-tracing-specifically-ray-traced-global-illumination.1358995/">shared on ResetERA</a>, Kirby Air Riders reportedly uses the RTXGI SDK, meaning that the racing game uses ray-traced global illumination in some capacity, making it the first proper Nintendo first-party game to do so.</p>



<p>While it's not yet known how Kirby Air Riders implements ray-traced global illumination, this is a very interesting find in light of how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the game. According to our own Nathan Birch, the game not only looks gorgeous, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">runs at a smooth 60 FPS even when the tracks become utterly chaotic</a>. As such, it will be interesting to see how this is achieved, and whether any upscaling technology, such as the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-nvidia-dlss-types-nintendo-switch-2/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, is also utilized to deliver the excellent image quality and solid performance the game exhibits at launch.</p>



<p>Although Kirby Air Riders is reportedly the first proper Nintendo game to use ray tracing in some capacity, this isn't the first time we could be witnessing ray tracing on Nintendo Switch 2. Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world game developed by Ubisoft based on the popular franchise, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">also makes ample use of ray tracing</a>. Future third-party releases, such as Resident Evil Requiem, will likely utilize ray tracing in some capacity as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">judging from currently available footage</a></p>

			<p>The price will be the critical factor that will determine the success of the Steam Machine, but those who expected the upcoming system to be priced in the same range as a console will likely be disappointed, judging from some new information shared online.</p>



<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnKy4UEdiyo&amp;t=2s">In the latest episode of Linus Tech Tips' WAN Show podcast</a>, Linus commented on the yet-to-be-revealed price for the system. While he doesn't know the price (as no one does yet), there are strong indications the system won't fall in the $500 price range of the current PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X systems, judging from the reaction of Valve's employees during a recent media event to show the system to press and creators.</p>



<p><em>"When I said I'm disappointed it isn't going to follow a console pricing model, where its subsided by the fact that manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product, they asked what I meant by console price and I said $500. Nobody said anything, but the energy in the room wasn't great,"</em> Linus said during the podcast.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Valve said that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Steam Machine will be priced competitively with a PC of similar specs</a>, expecting a gaming PC in a console form factor to cost as much as a console is definitely a little unreasonable. As such, what happened at Valve's headquarters, as reported by Linus, shouldn't surprise anyone, especially in light of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-rumored-memory-price-hike-could-be-a-catastrophe-for-pc-gamers/">now expected massive RAM price increase</a> that will impact a wide range of hardware, including gaming hardware.</p>



<p>However, despite Valve believing that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/">a bigger game library will ensure the Steam Machine is more successful than its predecessors</a> and that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/">it will offer a better gaming experience than 70% of current gaming rigs</a>, pricing still needs to be right for the system to be successful. While it is true <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">it may have a hard time delivering a 4K@60 FPS gaming experience even with AMD FSR</a>, those who want to have a hassle-free gaming experience in the vein of consoles won't look at the system twice if it's priced too high, especially in the current climate where the price of living continues to rise worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-is-going-nuts-selling-rog-strix-27%E2%80%B3-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-at-a-new-record-low.1359070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fact that this <strong>Asus ROG Strix 27-inch OLED gaming monitor</strong> has never been on sale before makes<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/"> this Black Friday drop to an all-time low of $549 (down from $699) on Amazon a big deal</a>. Asus usually sticks to its guns with MSRP on premium ROG monitors but Amazon’s opening day of Black Friday saw deep cuts across the board on everything from the larger 32 and 34-inch models that also reached new all-time lows.</p>
<p>Gaming monitors solve the fundamental problem of seeing what you’re shooting at before your opponent does, and OLED panels take that advantage to another level with instant pixel response and infinite contrast. The ROG Strix XG27AQDMG combines <strong>1440p resolution with 240Hz refresh rate and true 0.03ms response time</strong> in a package that makes everything else look washed out and sluggish.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED Technology Perfect for Gaming Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>26.5-inch WOLED panel offers a resolution of 2560 by 1440</strong>&nbsp;which hits a sweet spot between the lack of detail in 1080p and the demanding GPU of 4K. Third-generation WOLED technology results in brighter white windows and clearer text compared to previous generations of OLED that struggled with full-screen brightness. Each pixel emits its own light and turns fully off for true blacks, creating infinite contrast that makes dark scenes in games actually visible instead of turning into grey mush. The glossy coating maximizes color vibrancy and eliminates the haze that matte coatings introduce, though it does require some attention to room lighting to avoid reflections. The <strong>99% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage</strong> means colors look saturated and accurate without the oversaturation that cheap gaming monitors produce.</p>



<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms grey-to-grey response time</strong> eliminates the ghosting and motion blur that plagues slower panels. Your mouse cursor moves across the screen with zero trailing, and fast-paced shooters clearly display enemy movement without smearing, while racing games show track details even at high speeds. This combination of high refresh rate and instant pixel response creates the motion clarity that competitive gamers need to track targets accurately.</p>



<p>ROG’s exclusive OLED Anti-flicker technology <strong>reduces flicker during refresh rate fluctuations</strong> that can cause eye strain during extended gaming sessions. Conventionally, variable refresh rate displays would usually flicker when frame rates change rapidly, but Asus worked out algorithms that would smooth these transitions. The technology works invisibly behind the scenes, maintaining consistent image quality whether you’re getting 240fps or dropping to 120fps during intensive scenes.</p>
<p>Included in the purchase price is <strong>three months of Adobe Creative Cloud access</strong>&nbsp;which adds value if you do any photo editing, graphic design, or video work. The OLED’s perfect blacks and wide color gamut make it excellent for creative work beyond gaming, as it’s able to accurately display the full range of colors that content creators need to see. The 1440p resolution provides enough screen real estate for editing timelines or working with multiple windows without feeling cramped.</p>
<p>At $549, this is the first discount ever on the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG and brings OLED gaming down to prices that previously only got you mid-tier IPS panels. You’re getting third-generation WOLED technology with burn-in protections, 240Hz refresh and instant response times for $150 less than Asus’s asking price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GoPro should be looking over its shoulder because DJI has been closing the gap fast in the action camera market over the past few years. The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro</strong> goes head-to-head with GoPro’s latest Hero13 Black, and in several areas, it actually pulls ahead. This Black Friday deal on Amazon drops the <em>Essential combo</em> to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">a record low of $259, down from the usual $339</a>, which undercuts GoPro’s flagship by a decent margin.</p>
<p>Action cameras capture moments your phone can’t handle like mountain biking through trails, surfing big waves, or documenting motorcycle rides where stabilization and durability matter more than megapixels. DJI packed this camera with a massive sensor, advanced stabilization, and dual touchscreens that make it easier to use than the competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Sensor That Handles Low Light</h2>
<p>The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro features a 1/1.3-inch sensor</strong>, considerably larger than you’d find in most action cameras. It features 2.4-micrometer pixels that pull in more light per pixel to give you usable footage in conditions where other action cameras produce grainy messes. The 13.5-stop dynamic range means you can shoot into bright skies without losing detail in shadows or capture sunset scenes without blowing out the highlights. <strong>DJI’s processing handles 4K video at 120fps</strong> which gives you buttery slow-motion playback to analyze your technique or create dramatic highlight reels. In quick-changing lighting conditions such as moving between shaded forest trails and sunny clearings, this sensor does an excellent job of maintaining consistent exposure.</p>



<p>Subject tracking that actually works in the real world is powered by an advanced 4nm chip. You can set the <strong>camera to track yourself, friends, or even pets</strong> while <strong>shooting in either 16:9 or vertical 9:16 aspect ratios</strong>. Its tracking stays locked on moving subjects with remarkable accuracy, removing that perpetual anxiety of whether I am staying in frame or not. This feature transforms solo content creation because you simply don’t need someone behind the camera following you around.</p>
<p><strong>Voice control</strong> remains on and ready for response within about a meter radius so you can start recording, shoot photos, or stop recording from a distance without touching the camera. This makes sense when you’re skiing, climbing, or doing anything where reaching for buttons breaks your flow. Recognition accuracy handles commands reliably even in moderately noisy environments, though strong winds or loud motors can sometimes throw it off.</p>



<p>The <strong>dual OLED touchscreens on front and back</strong> eradicate that usual action camera frustration: composing shots blind. The front screen means you can frame yourself perfectly for vlogs or selfie shots without having to guess where you’re positioned. Both screens stay bright and readable in direct sunlight, which matters enormously when you try to adjust settings on a sunny beach or snowy mountain. The <strong>touchscreen interface responds quickly and logically,</strong> and makes adjustments of parameters feel natural rather than something you have to commit to memory, along with button combinations.</p>
<p>DJI’s 360° <em>HorizonSteady</em> <strong>stabilization keeps your horizon straight</strong>, no matter how much the camera rotates on the roll axis. You can mount this on your chest, helmet, or handlebars and get footage that’s like it was coming from a gimbal. The stabilization algorithm compensates for sudden jolts, vibrations, and continuous movement while maintaining natural-looking motion.</p>
<p>The 1950mAh battery provides <strong>up to four hours of continuous recording</strong> in normal conditions and impressively keeps 3.6 hours even at negative 20 degrees Celsius. That kind of cold-weather performance puts it ahead of most action cameras, which start dying quickly in freezing temperatures. The <strong>IP68 rating</strong> certifies the camera for depths up to 20 meters without any additional housing, so you can take it snorkeling, surfing, or kayaking without worry.</p>
<p>This Black Friday price of $259 makes the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro substantially cheaper than GoPro’s Hero13 Black with comparable or superior features in several key areas. The larger sensor alone justifies the purchase for anyone who shoots in challenging lighting conditions and the dual OLED screens eliminate the composition guesswork that plagues single-screen action cameras.</p>

<p>Major Fortnite leaks for Chapter 7 content have begun to flood social media following a creator preview event in Los Angeles, with standout details including driveable reboot vans and a dedicated bots mode.</p>



<p>Epic Games is gearing up for the major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour end-of-chapter event</a> next week, which will be followed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start of Chapter 7</a>, Season 1, and big changes are on the cards that will impact various core mechanics of the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode-amp-storm-size-changes-coming">Driveable Reboot Vans, Bots Mode &amp; Storm Size Changes Coming</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big changes afoot. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, some of the biggest gameplay changes coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7 include reboot vans being driveable, an overhaul to the gameplay UI, and a dedicated Solo vs Bots mode.</p>



<p>Bots are nothing new in Fortnite and are widely used to populate Battle Royale lobbies to reduce wait time, but introducing a dedicated mode where solo players go head-to-head with them is a big change. However, there is still plenty to be detailed about the game mode.</p>



<p>Driveable reboot vans align with previous hints towards a revamp of the reboot system in Fortnite, which will result in changes to gameplay tactically as reboot vans will be moveable, thus becoming a core resource later in games to revive fallen teammates, or prevent opponents from bringing back their squad.</p>



<p>Another big change, again leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991290054728159308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, shows that storm sizes are being adjusted in Chapter 7 away from the standard circle closing in, instead having a ‘seven’ shape. However, it’s mentioned that the sizes and timings are not final.</p>



<p>Epic Games will reveal all the major changes to Fortnite in Chapter 7 closer to the release date, likely sharing the full details in a pre-launch blog ahead of the start of the new chapter on December 30.</p>

And now, thanks to footage that has leaked from a preview event attended by media and influencers, Chapter 7's USA-style setting has been confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage now widely circulating on social media shows an arid area with palm trees. In the distance, the game's map references an area named Sandy Strip. Signage names Chapter 7's first season as being titled "Pacific Break."</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LEAKED CHAPTER 7 INFO FROM CREATOR EVENT 💀 </p><p>- Hot air balloons <br>- Driveable Reboot Vans<br>- Solo VS Bots mode <br>- Rift A Palooza events that spawn rifts<br>- Gameplay UI update<br>- Battle Pass has Marty McFly and The Bride <a href="https://t.co/l9lBrLZMIz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/l9lBrLZMIz</a></p></div>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other changes visible in the footage look to include driveable reboot vans, and the option for a new Solo vs Bots mode (although it's unclear if this was provided just for the preview event). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite has followed up the leaks with its own, official look at Chapter 7, via a top-down view of the game's new battle royale map that shows a more urban area, complete with wide city streets and homes with backyard pools. (The top-down view here is a bit GTA 1, isn't it?)</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A first look at the battleground to come. <br>Preparation = Victory <a href="https://t.co/4KO1whuy80" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4KO1whuy80</a></p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1991325705016340689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, Fortnite also publicly shared footage of Quentin Tarantino appearing at the aforementioned event, standing next to a Fortnite version of Kill Bill's infamous Pussy Wagon car. Here, the word "pussy" has been replaced by a picture of Meowscles, the game's fan-favorite swole cat. Leaked footage from the event, meanwhile, shows a new in-game skin for Uma Thurman's Kill Bill character The Bride. Oh, and also Marty McFly from Back to the Future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite typically works on its big annual map change around a year in advance, and it's fun to consider the idea that, 12 months ago, Chapter 7's USA-inspired setting was being planned with the expectation that a certain other big game with a USA-inspired setting would launch at the same time. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The one.

But up until May this year, Rockstar was still saying the game would arrive this week, around the time Epic Games has launched a fresh Chapter of Fortnite for the past few years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year, Fortnite will hold its big Chapter 6 finale event on Saturday, November 29. Chapter Seven will then launch imminently after, though some period of downtime is expected. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-event-trailer-teases-godzilla-and-kill-bill-appearances-as-chapter-seven-looms">teaser trailer for that in-game event released officially last night</a> and featured Fortnite going full Ready Player One and Avengers: Endgame with its plans, while tying up story threads from the past few years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent weeks, the secret bunkers in Fortnite's OG mode have been flashing messages in morse code, such as "Zero Hour", which we now know is the name of the upcoming event, and "Titans". After seeing that teaser trailer, fans think "Titans" refers to the game's current main antagonist, The Dark Presence, a towering demonic entity that rules Chapter 6's Spirit Realm, but also to the forces now squaring up against him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming battle, players look set to fight alongside a series of other looming figures: the returning Godzilla and King Kong, plus the newly giant-sized Homer Simpson. Is there a clue to a much longer story arc here too? Think back to Fortnite's Chapter 5, which introduced the current era of storytelling focused on blue-haired hero Hope, and you could also link in the mysterious giant hand that erupted from the ground holding Pandora's Box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are all of these Titans? And how will Fortnite wrap all of these things together (plus Star Wars' X-Wings, Uma Thurman, and Marty McFly) as it moves to its new USA-based home? We've just over a week to go until we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<header><section>
<p>This literally can't fit on a cartridge</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ac15c7c16a707"><a title="Aerith" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac15c7c16a707/aerith.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has just posted an update on the expected file size for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As we had perhaps expected, it's big, folks. Like, real big. Store listings on the eShop already have some pretty lofty numbers attached to them, but according to Square Enix, these actually aren't accurate.</p>
<p>As stated on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291">X</a>, the file size for the <strong>Standard Edition will be 90GB to 95GB</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>Limited Early Purchase Edition and Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Editions will be 93.8GB to 99GB</strong>.</p>

<p>Woof! This means, of course, that the game simply won't fit on a 64GB cartridge for its physical release, and so Square Enix has, like many others, opted for a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>It makes us wonder just how large <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a> will be alongside the untitled third entry. Is it possible that these three games combined simply won't fit on the Switch 2 without an additional microSD Express Card..?</p>
<p>Needless to say, if you've yet to invest in some extra storage space, now might be the time to do so. We suspect 2026 is going to be packed with some pretty sizeable ports, so you're going to want to have all the spare GBs you can get.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

            <p>The messy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">legal dispute</a> between publishers Krafton and three former lead developers on the game rumbles on. The lawyerly wranglings about Krafton's decision to delay Sub 2's early access, leaving a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">$250 million bonus to developers Unknown Worlds</a> up in the air, then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">fire Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill</a>, are still wrangling.</p>
<p>A pre-trial briefing released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publisher-krafton-allegedly-looked-to-chatgpt-to-figure-out-how-to-not-pay-that-250-million-bonus">earlier this week</a> saw the three leads claim Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han consulted ChatGPT about ways the company could get around paying the much-discussed $250 million bonus, which the leads claim they would have shared with the rest of Unknown Worlds. Krafton subsequently said in a statement to Kotaku that this allegation from the ex-leads was "simply a distraction from their own efforts to destroy evidence". Now, testimony from Chang-han has emerged, in which the exec concedes he did consult ChatGPT about aspects of the Subnautica 2 situation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon learning that Cleveland and McGuire weren't directly involved in Subnautica 2's development, Chang-han said "I started discussing this matter with various teams within the company to find - to figure out what we could do," in testimony spotted by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-krafton-denied-its-ceo-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess-krafton-ceo-says-he-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The CEO said he chatted to various teams within the company about this, then "searched on ChatGPT to get faster answers to figure out what kind of rights we have", adding that he used it "just like Google search". Lawyers for the former Unknown Worlds leads subsequently brought up a message Chang-han sent to Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park in June, in which he wrote: "Now, ChatGPT [is] start[ing] to answer that it is difficult to cancel the earn-out. If so, this is a contract under which we can only be dragged around."</p><p>Asked why that and another conversation the CEO had with ChatGPT about the situation were subsequently deleted, Chang-han cited concerns about what OpenAI might do with their contents, saying "what I learned is that - from OpenAI, is that if you use certain important information concerning your company, then that type of information can be used by OpenAI for learning purposes."</p>
<p>Basically, the exec's stance is that he was simply using ChatGPT in this scenario in the same way he now uses it "dozens" of times a day when dealing with Krafton's usual business, as he would a regular search engine. Krafton haven't been shy about sharing how much they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-and-inzoi-publishers-announce-voluntary-layoff-program-amid-the-era-of-ai-transformation">generally embracing the use of AI</a> as a business. The question is whether it's really appropriate for a CEO to be turning to an AI chatbot for help with a situation of this gravity.</p>
<p>As we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">depressingly often</a>, when company heads like Chang-han make bad decisions, lots of people suffer, making it rather terrifying to think that a technology still <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ai-factual-errors-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-b2867620.html">very prone</a> to churning out errors or  inaccuracies could now be relied on as part of that decision making. Meanwhile, the deletions obviously risk adding to the impression that Krafton aren't being transparent about their motivations. If Chang-han <em>is</em> being honest about the reasons for the deletion, it's also interesting to hear the CEO of a company this committed to generative AI as a tool expressing anxiety about what these tools do with our data.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Krafton for comment. In their latest statement on the case in general, the company said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are grateful to the court for its thorough commitment to understanding the facts, and we are confident we have demonstrated our commitment to delivering the best game possible to our fans. We made clear to the court that we were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority.</p>
<p>Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs. We look forward to receiving a decision. We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can almost certainly expect plenty more news to follow as this saga continues to get deeper and deeper into the legal waters.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-get-fooled-by-apple%E2%80%99s-official-charger-anker-20w-charger-costs-6x-less-and-works-just-as-well.1359040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple charges <strong>$19 for its official 20W USB-C charger with no cable included</strong> which makes this 2-pack look absolutely insane in comparison. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">Black Friday bundle on Amazon drops to an all-time low of $11 from the usual $18</a> and includes <strong>two 20W Anker chargers (and two ports on each) plus two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong>. You’re getting everything you need to fast charge two devices for less than what Apple charges for a single bare charger.</p>
<p>Anker earned its reputation by making products for charging that match or exceed official manufacturer specifications while costing a good deal less. The fact that Apple sells Anker products in their own retail stores tells you everything about the quality and reliability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Matches Apple’s Specs</h2>
<p>The<strong> 20W output provides the fastest charging speed available for the iPhone 15/16/17 series phones</strong> over USB-C Power Delivery. Your phone charges from zero to 50% in about 30 minutes which also happens to be exactly what you get from an Apple-issued charger. The charging speed behaves the same across all supported devices including iPads and even Samsung Galaxy phones, or whatever device utilizes USB-C PD charging. Anker uses the same charging protocols that Apple has put in place, so your device cannot tell any difference between this charger and an official Apple unit.</p>



<p>Each of <strong>these chargers includes both a USB-C and a USB-A port</strong> which work simultaneously for charging up to two devices from a single wall outlet. The dual-port design lets you fast-charge your iPhone via USB-C while topping up your AirPods or Apple Watch via the USB-A port. Both ports remain active at the same time without reducing charging speed on either device, eliminating the frustration of choosing which device charges first.</p>



<p>This compact form factor measures in smaller than Apple’s official charger while it outputs the same amount of power. Anker managed to shrink the size by using more efficient component layout and modern charging circuitry. When stored in bags or pockets, the folding prongs keep the profile slim, flipping out with ease when you need to plug in. It features a black finish that looks professional and fits well with most devices and surroundings.</p>
<p>The Anker <em>MultiProtect</em> safety system offers <strong>overvoltage protection, temperature control, current regulation, and short-circuit prevention</strong>. The safety features continuously monitor charging and automatically shut down in the event of an anomaly. Temperature control prevents overheating in case of long use, thus protecting both the charger and your devices. The overvoltage protection means that your devices never get more power than they can safely handle to avoid voltage spikes that result in battery damage.</p>
<p>The<strong> 18-month warranty is a back-up assurance for Anker’s confidence</strong>, and their customer service responds promptly to issues without requiring proof of receipts for purchases or complicated return processes.</p>
<p>For $11, this Black Friday bundle is less expensive than an individual official Apple charger without any cable. You get certified charging gear from a brand in good enough standing for Apple to sell the products in their own stores, including the same degree of safety and build quality as the official option.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-a-ps5-or-gaming-pc-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-and-pedals-is-now-selling-for-pennies-2000645663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-a-ps5-or-gaming-pc-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-and-pedals-is-now-selling-for-pennies.1359037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Racing games with a controller are like driving with oven mitts on and the <strong>Logitech G29</strong> just<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/"> dropped to its lowest price ever at $229 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $329</a>. This bundle<strong> includes the wheel and floor pedals</strong> which turns Gran Turismo, Forza, or F1 games from arcade button-mashing into something that feels like piloting a car.</p>
<p>The G29 has been the entry point into sim racing for years because it delivers<strong> force feedback and build quality</strong> that punches way above its price point. You get real resistance through the wheel, actual brake pressure sensitivity and paddle shifters that click with satisfying precision. Playing racing games without a wheel setup is like playing guitar on a keyboard, technically possible but completely missing the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Force Feedback That Means Something</h2>
<p>The G29 uses<strong> dual-motor force feedback to simulate road conditions</strong>, tire grip, and understeer through the wheel itself. You feel the wheels lose traction before you see it on screen, which gives you that split-second warning to correct your line. The helical gearing inside keeps operation smooth and relatively quiet compared to older gear-driven wheels that sounded like angry washing machines. When you clip a curb in Assetto Corsa or hit gravel in Dirt Rally, the wheel kicks back in your hands exactly like it would in a real car.</p>



<p>The <strong>900-degree rotation means you can turn the wheel two and a half times</strong> from lock to lock, just like an actual F1 car. Most racing titles automatically adjust for this range, meaning you get accurate steering ratios that are in line with what professional drivers actually experience. You can catch slides by feeding in opposite lock, make smooth wide turns with hand-over-hand steering, and feel the difference between car types based on their specific steering characteristics. Games with proper wheel support, like iRacing, ACC, or Gran Turismo 7, truly come alive with this level of input fidelity.</p>



<p>The<strong> pedal set includes a clutch pedal for manual transmission fans</strong>, though you can ignore it if you prefer sequential or automatic gearboxes. The brake pedal uses a progressive spring system that requires actual pressure to fully depress and mimicks the resistance you’d feel through a real brake system. This pressure sensitivity means you can trail-brake into corners and modulate braking force with precision instead of treating it like an on-off switch. The gas pedal has lighter resistance for smooth throttle control, which matters enormously when you’re trying to manage traction out of slow corners.</p>
<p>Logitech’s G HUB software provides granular control over force feedback strength, wheel sensitivity and button mapping on PC. You can create different profiles for different games, since each title responds to wheel settings differently. Some games need stronger force feedback to communicate properly, while others work better with subtler forces. The <strong>wheel connects via USB and draws power from your console or PC</strong>, so there’s no separate power brick to manage.</p>
<p>The <strong>G29 works natively with PS5, PS4, PC, and Mac</strong>, though game support varies by platform and title. Most major racing sims and simcades recognize the wheel immediately, without the need for driver installations or complicated configuration. The wheel includes a full complement of PlayStation buttons integrated into the face, so you can navigate menus and access game functions without reaching for a controller.</p>
<p>At $229, this Black Friday price makes the Logitech G29 more accessible than ever for people who’ve been curious about sim racing but couldn’t justify spending $400-plus on a pricey alternative. This hundred-dollar discount brings the entry cost down to where impulse purchases start making sense, especially if you’ve already got a racing game library waiting for proper hardware.</p>

<p>Another year in Fortnite is drawing to a close, and a new chapter is on the horizon. Insider Gaming has all the details about when Chapter 7, Season 1 kicks off in the game.</p>



<p>The past year in Fortnite has been full of huge collabs, including the likes of The Simpsons, Star Wars, Godzilla, and Power Rangers, and Chapter 7 is likely to follow in a similar trend with other huge crossovers.</p>



<p>For all the details about the launch of Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1, take a look at the guide below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date">What is The Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big updates. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chapter 7, Season 1 in Fortnite is due to kick off on Sunday, November 30, as confirmed by Epic Games themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games has begun to tease the new chapter, including a big collab with Quentin Tarantino’s <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1991280378355806501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kill Bill</a>, which is set to be one of the first major collabs of Chapter 7 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>The tease confirmed the release date for Fortnite Chapter 7, which comes the day after the big <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour live event</a>, bringing an end to Chapter 6, which is expected to be followed by downtime soon in the early hours of the morning on November 30 ahead of the season launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-start-time">Do We Know The Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>No official start time for Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 has been announced by Epic Games, nor is it expected that a precise time will be shared due to the maintenance length, but history provides an idea of how long downtime will be.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite’s Zero Hour live event takes place at 2 PM ET on November 29, and server downtime is expected to follow soon after. While it’s unlikely to be immediate, downtime should take place at the usual start time of around 2 AM ET on November 30, and they will be out of action for a while.</p>







<p>In 2024, downtime before the launch of Chapter 6 was seven hours, but a year earlier, the Big Bang event was followed by 11 hours of downtime—with the longer spell likely due to the variety of new modes that were launched, including LEGO Fortnite and Fortnite Festival.</p>



<p>In 2022, end-of-chapter downtime was 9 hours, while 2021 downtime was a staggering 18 hours. However, nothing compares to The End event in October 2019, which was followed by 36 hours of downtime.</p>



<p>Based on this, don’t expect Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 to be live until 9 AM ET at the very earliest, and the wait could be many hours longer. As usual, social media is the best place to keep track.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos guards its pricing religiously throughout the year and refuses to discount even when competitors slash their prices for random sales events. Black Friday on Amazon is<strong> the only time Sonos loosens its grip on retail prices</strong>, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Beam (second gen) soundbar just dropped to a new record low of $349, down from its usual $499</a>. Only 16 units remain in stock for the black color at the time of writing, which tells you how quickly people are grabbing this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos in a Compact Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>Beam soundbar packs Dolby Atmos processing into a soundbar that measures just 25.6 inches wide</strong>, which means it fits under most TVs without dominating your entertainment center. Atmos creates a three-dimensional sound effect that places audio above, around, and beside you instead of just firing sound from the front. The soundbar uses psychoacoustic processing to bounce sound off your ceiling and walls and creates the impression of height channels without installing speakers overhead. Explosions in action movies feel like they’re happening above you, rain sounds fall from the ceiling, and helicopters pass convincingly overhead.</p>



<p>Sonos engineered the Beam soundbar with <strong>dedicated drivers for different frequency ranges</strong> including a center tweeter that’s specifically responsible for crystal-clear dialogue reproduction. The clarity of the dialogue is enormously important in modern content, where mumbling actors and aggressive sound mixing often bury conversations under music and effects. The bass response is full of lively low-end that doesn’t require a separate subwoofer, although Sonos does let you add their Sub if you want room-shaking bass when watching movies or listening to music.</p>



<p><strong>Setup, from unboxing to content with better audio, takes about five minutes</strong>. You connect one HDMI cable from the soundbar to your TV’s eARC or ARC port, plug in the power cable, and the Sonos app will walk you through the rest. Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to analyze your room’s acoustics and then auto-adjusts the soundbar’s output to compensate for room size, furniture placement, and wall materials.</p>
<p>The Beam soundbar streams music, podcasts, radio, and audiobooks from just about every major service when your TV is off. You can use it as a dedicated music speaker throughout the day, then seamlessly switch to TV audio in the evening. AirPlay 2 support allows for direct streaming from an Apple device, while the Sonos app provides access to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens of other services. For voice control, you can use Alexa or Google Assistant built directly into the soundbar, adjusting volume, changing inputs, or controlling playback with ease and without the touch of a remote.</p>
<p>Because of HDMI-CEC, <strong>your TV remote controls the Beam soundbars’s volume automatically</strong> and saves you from having to juggle multiple remotes or programming universal controllers. The soundbar responds immediately to the volume buttons on your existing remote after you set it up, which makes the whole system feel integrated rather than cobbled together.</p>
<p>At $349, the latest Beam soundbar is $150 off its usual price and undercuts a number of competing soundbars that offer similar features but notably worse sound quality. Sonos rarely discounts its products because they’re worth their full value based on performance alone, but this Black Friday deal is a real doozy.</p>

              <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s partnership with Disney has brought it some extraordinary crossover events, not least <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142">the current chapter’s enormous&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em> tie-in</a>. But you haven’t seen anything yet: After Chapter 6 reaches its big finale at the end of this month, Chapter 7 is going to introduce the most unlikely property yet: Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill</em>. In fact, it seems like it might be going far further than that, filling in a gap in the legendary movie’s lore by recreating a lost scripted chapter, Yuki’s Revenge, that was never shot for the film. This is all right in time to promote the cinematic re-release of both movies in one, the four hour and 41 minute <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bill-whole-bloody-affair-return-theaters-december-4-hour-tarantino-2000631123"><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em></a>.</p> <p>Yuki’s Revenge was a chapter written in the original script for <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>, but was never shot for the movie. It was originally going to be Chapter 5 (I know, it’s confusing, both&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Kill Bill </em>use chapters), and <a href="https://kill-bill.livejournal.com/357796.html">you can read the original script here</a>. The scene would have starred Gogo Yubari’s sister, Yuki, who went entirely unmentioned in the released movie, and was originally going to hunt down The Bride to avenge her sister’s death. Well, now, as improbable as this feels to type, it seems the events could finally play out in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>?</p>

 <p>Chapter 7’s first promotional poster (above) has a picture of <em>Kill Bill</em> characters Gogo Yubari and The Bride, accompanied by a shades-wearing Fishstick, along with the words “The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge” before “Fortnite After Dark.” An <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRQXUuwgZjX/">official Instagram post</a> says the same, but this time has Yubari and Peely, because we officially live in the weirdest timeline.</p>   <p>Tarantino and The Bride actor Uma Thurman showed up to an event last night which <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15308673/Uma-Thurman-Kill-Bill-T-shirt-reunites-Quentin-Tarantino.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> confusingly describes as “the premiere” of <em>The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge</em>, and the pair were photographed in front of a huge <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>banner promoting the Chapter 7, alongside a model of the movie’s Pussy Wagon. Although exactly what this event really was is peculiarly unclear, with outlets like <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em> not even having articles about it. Have they filmed the scene? Will it be part of the new seven minute animated sequence that’s being added to the theatrical release of the movie double-bill? It’s all bewildering. We have, of course, reached out to Epic to try to find out more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino poses by the "P*ssy Wagon" at the "Fortnite Chapter 7" event in LA. <a href="https://t.co/reOwxBjUqH">pic.twitter.com/reOwxBjUqH</a></p> <p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1991302219904479362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Whether this recreation of the missing chapter will be a storyline event within the game, or some sort of live event taking place on the in-game big screens, is also unknown at this point. What seems fairly certain is that Chapter 7 will feature <em>Kill Bill</em> skins and characters, and we can only assume lots of long swords.</p> <p>However, it also seems The Bride will be showing up sooner than that, as part of Chapter 6’s big finale live event. A new trailer shows her arriving on her motorbike admidst the ludicrous confusion of King Kong, Godzilla, <em>Star Wars</em> X-Wings, and a mostly naked Homer Simpson throwing a giant donut. <em>Fortnite</em>, everyone! That’s all taking place November 29, 2 p.m. ET.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is currently enjoying a The Simpsons' themed season, with Homer, Marge and co all creating havoc on the streets of Springfield. Even the holier-than-thou Ned Flanders has been seen getting in on the action.</p>
<p>And now, a leak for the latest season has shown off a reported new skin for Homer Jay, and it looks like the Simpson patriarch will be getting his nips out. Should this be the case, it will be the first time nipples have appeared in Epic's shooter.</p>

<p>For a bit of context, the lack of Fortnite nipples on its shirtless characters famously began after a Travis Scott concert was held in-game, with the <a href="https://x.com/Fresh/status/1252792137143312384">singer sporting some very smooth pecs</a>. "We watched Travis Scott's Fortnite concert again and my son was like 'what the... where are his nipples?!?!' Lmaooo. I took a look and apparently Travis ain't got any nips," <a href="https://x.com/saturnsmercy6/status/1253698878265753600">reads one of many posts from that time</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Homer, who to be fair is a cartoon so perhaps this makes the inclusion of nipples easier. The images and video (see below) of the leak show Homer in his underwear. According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette">@DrCacahuette</a>, the set "will have skin, lego style, back bling, pickaxe". All I can say is, you go Homer! #freethenipple</p>
<p>So, are you looking forward to running about Fortnite as a topless Homer should these leaks be accurate?</p>

<p>As Connor reported earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">Fortnite saw a surge of players with the new Simpsons' themed season</a>. According to Epic Games, this surge hadn't been seen since the last holiday season.</p>

            <p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> patch has brought a lot of bug fixes, balance adjustments, and an overwhelming wave of displayable ducks for collectors out there. It's also taken down a titan, a weapon so strong in close-quarters it was dominating firefights.</p>
<p>What am I quacking on about? Well, after one collector of rubber ducks made a plea for the developers to allow them to show off their horde of little yellow guys in-game, it seems like Embark has taken the request to heart. Now, in your Raider Den, a massive number of rubber ducks will be displayed around the room.</p>
<p><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/duck-update-patch-notes-1-3-0">In the official patch notes</a>, this is simply explained with: "Your Raider Den has been ducked out." The limits of how far this goes, and the requirements to achieve this unique look to your personal room, remains unclear as of writing. It is, however, quite funny.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for the massive nerf this patch, the Venator has been knocked down a peg or two, hopefully removing it from its peak as a close range monster. The patch blog includes the following explanation: "The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We're re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter."</p><p>As for some of those smaller - but still important - balance adjustments there's been a lot of love given to the new map Stella Montis. Two spawn locations have been removed as they were too close to Arc enemies, and various collision issues have been fixed. The new Arc Shredder has been fixed so lure grenades work on them, and their navigation abilities have been improved, so good luck with that.</p>
<p>There are additional changes made which can be read in the full patch notes, but all in all it's a hefty and healthy patch that further improves the game. A game that,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"> aside from foundational issues you may have</a>, continues to truck along in a solid state. One wonders what surprises lie in store for Arc Raiders players as we near December.</p>

<p>Speaking via social media, the team stated that the delay would "help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver". Though a specific date has not been specified, we can currently expect to see it launch in March 2026.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Development Update for OPUS: Prism Peak</p>
<p>As we move into the final stages of development, we’ve taken a careful look at our schedule and decided to adjust the original release window to make sure the game reaches the level of quality we’re aiming for.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owkmhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>After revisiting our timeline, we can now confirm that OPUS: Prism Peak is planned for release in March 2026. Thank you so much for your continued support.</p>
<p>We’re truly sorry for the delay. We know this isn’t the news you were hoping for.</p>
<p>But we believe this extra time will help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver.</p>
<p>Everyone at SIGONO is giving their best, and we’re committed to bringing OPUS: Prism Peak to you in its strongest form when it arrives in March 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We covered OPUS: Prism Peak with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/opus-prism-peak-will-capture-your-heart-with-new-teaser">teaser trailer</a> all the way back in 2023, so it's safe to say that this game has been in the public eye for quite some time. Here's hoping it will satisfy fans of the series when it eventually launches in 2026.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new GeForce Hotfix display driver, version 581.94. This is based on the latest GeForce Game Ready driver, version 581.80, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched around two weeks ago</a> with day-one optimizations for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Europa Universalis V, and Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<p>Following that Game Ready driver, users reported lower performance in some PC games after updating to Windows 11 October 2025 KB5066835 [5561605]. This GeForce hotfix driver resolves the issue, so if you've experienced that, you should download it right away. Otherwise, the fix will be rolled into the next Game Ready driver, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Last year Qualcomm promised that games would “just work” on its Snapdragon X Elite laptops, but in my testing I found that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24215905/microsoft-windows-on-arm-gaming-laptops-notepad">far from the case</a>. Now, a year on, Windows on Arm is a lot more ready for gaming, thanks to emulator improvements, driver updates, a new Snapdragon Control Panel, and Qualcomm’s work on anti-cheat compatibility.</p><p>Qualcomm is releasing its <a href="https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/catalog/item/SnapdragonControlPanel">Snapdragon Control Panel</a> this week, which automatically detects games you’ve installed on a Snapdragon X Elite laptop and then optimizes them. It’s very similar to the apps that AMD and Nvidia use for their own GPUs, with settings for frame rate caps, anti-aliasing, texture filtering, and much more.</p><p>The Snapdragon Control Panel also allows you to install the latest Adreno GPU drivers, which are optimized for the latest games to improve stability and performance. Qualcomm says it has made fixes and improvements for more than 100 games since launch last year, with continued bug fixes for stability and performance.</p><p>Alongside the Snapdragon Control Panel release, both Microsoft and Qualcomm have also made some significant changes to help PC gaming on Windows on Arm. Microsoft’s Prism emulator now supports x86 Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), which are required by many games and creative apps. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X2 Elite chips also support AVX2 emulation, and existing Snapdragon X series devices “will also receive the update in coming weeks.”</p><p>Microsoft has also updated its Xbox app on Windows on Arm recently to add the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758828/microsoft-windows-on-arm-xbox-app-download-feature">ability to download ARM64 compatible games</a>. When Copilot Plus PCs launched last year, the Xbox app was simply a portal to Xbox Cloud Gaming. It didn’t have library or store options, so you couldn’t use it to install games from PC Game Pass. That’s all changed now.</p><p>Qualcomm has also been working with Epic Games to get <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite"><em>Fortnite </em>running on Windows on Arm</a>, with full kernel-level anti-cheat support. You’ll need the latest Adreno GPU driver to get <em>Fortnite </em>running, and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/11/windows-on-snapdragon-performance-boosts">Qualcomm says</a> it’s also working with other anti-cheat providers like Tencent’s Anti-Cheat Expert, Roblox’s Hyperion, Denuvo, InProtect GameGuard, Uncheater, and BattleEye to enable more multiplayer games on Windows on Arm.</p><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s arrival on Windows on Arm comes just as the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821177/fortnite-xbox-on-pc-app-store-epic-games-play-anywhere-crew-game-pass">debuts on the Xbox PC store</a>. It’s the first time Epic Games has released <em>Fortnite </em>on another PC store or launcher, and it’s part of a deal to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Fortnite Crew to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p></div><p>All of these improvements are a much better start for gaming on Windows on Arm than the launch last year, but performance and compatibility is still far from perfect.

Although he puts his all into communicating his work – which is perhaps evident in the lengthy Direct presentations for the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> – he nevertheless refrains from "trying to promote myself":</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adtyrxuh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>"I think I've always wanted to live an unassuming life. I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. Becoming a laughing stock on the internet would be problematic. That's why I frequently turn down requests for interviews. I think it's best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable to us! In addition to his games, Sakurai is also well-known for his work on YouTube. With the 'Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games' channel, he offloads a heap of information about the process of game development for would-be creators. His work proved such a success that he was even listed as a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/masahiro-sakurai-receives-award-from-japanese-government">Cultural Affairs' annual Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists</a> over in Japan.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders, meanwhile, is out now for the Switch 2. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">8/10 review</a>, we said that it's a "chaotic and frenzied racer", but one that's also "got depth for those who wish to learn".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The fight between Krafton, the Korean company behind games like TERA, PUBG, and inZOI, and the founders of Unknown Worlds Entertainment (developers of Subnautica) continues even outside of court.</p>



<p>This morning, Krafton shared two files with the press. One of them is the sworn testimony of Unknown Worlds founder Chris Cleveland in the Delaware court, and the other is a document written by Cleveland as 'litigation help' while he prepared for the legal battle. Cleveland himself submitted the document into evidence, and now Krafton has underlined that several of his comments demonstrated racist views toward Korea and its people, as well as the unwavering conviction that the Korean developer would ultimately be seen as the 'villain' of this story. Here are a few excerpts:</p>



<p><em>Korea - they are the Joe Pesci of countries. Charming until they're incredible nasty. It goes to 11 quickly. No filter.</em></p>



<p><em>It can be emotionally draining dealing with this, especially as male westerners. [<span>Korean, seems to be implied</span>] Males might be more problem-solvers and bring less emotion - they're biological reasons for this. Making games is about problem solving.</em></p>



<p><em>Korea has been surrounded by enemies who want to kill them. They are fighters. It's small and nasty. Every year some big film star commits suicide because of sex, drugs, or something, hounded by press.</em></p>



<p><em>Delaware will say this is a bunch of sadistic Korean assholes (like Samsung - John Pleasance). They've cast as out as villains and it's done.</em></p>



<p><em>Delaware? Oh, they're fucked. You don't even need a Korean lawyer. History will remember that Krafton was bad. Even the Reddit crowd hates them because of Dark and Darker.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re playing the house’s money and we’re the home team. We don’t need to worry about these guys or our reputation. History will remember that Krafton was bad.</em></p>



<p>In the testimony, Cleveland admitted to saying last year that Unknown Worlds was no longer a place he really wanted to work at, and also that he was 'semi-retired' and only working on the Subnautica movie in some capacity. For their part, Krafton noted that he is now instead looking at being reinstated, and Cleveland replied that he is 'fired up now'.</p>



<p>It all started on July 2, when Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the original Unknown Worlds studio leadership</a> (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire). The fired founders <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed the company purposely delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying them a $250 million bonus</a>, but the South Korean developer eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that it was them who wanted to rush an unfinished version of the game out to get the payment, after neglecting their duties.</p>



<p>Since then, accusations have flown left and right. Just two days ago, it came to light that Krafton CEO Changham Kim <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had asked ChatGPT</a> if there was some way to avoid paying the three their big bonus. This came just days after the South Korean developer announced its shift toward being an 'AI-first company'.</p>



<p>Today's is likely to be one of many chapters in this controversial story. Stay tuned as we continue to cover it. For the record, Krafton did share a tidbit today about Subnautica 2's ongoing development:</p>



<p><em>We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.</em></p>

            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> patch has come with a handful of fixes for the sci-fi FPS, including substantial adjustments to various camo challenges proving troublesome for the cosmetically-minded player base. This includes a few weapon camos in Zombies, which were three-times-harder to unlock than intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes">As explained on the official patch notes</a>, these troublemakers were some<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-camo-challenges"> Zombie camos</a>, though the specific weapons / camos aren't listed. There were other cosmetics made easier to collect across different modes. Zombies mutilate challenges were bugged too, which has now been fixed.</p>
<p>The XR-3 ION had its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges">multiplayer camo</a> requirements shifted to headshots rather than one-shot-kills, as the burst fire was making things a little hard. So all in all, if you're in the midst of the intense camo grind in Black Ops 7, some of its rougher edges have been smoothed out.</p>

<p>Crashing issues across all game modes have been addressed, which should hopefully improve overall stability. Especially given the amount of losable progress during endgame campaign runs, crashes have proven exceptionally frustrating to a slice of the playerbase in recent days.</p><p>In fact, one bug that would force boot some players from Endgame campaign matches if certain extraction conditions were met has also been fixed, another much-needed addition to the patch which will improve what is currently one of Black Ops 7's most daunting grinds.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has proven to be a lot of fun among those engulfed in its fast-paced action, but how popular it is remains a bit of a mystery. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">It seems to have underperformed compared to prior games, but accurate stats are hard to find</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-wake-of-battlefield-6-and-arc-radiers-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffered-a-much-smaller-launch-than-previous-cod-games">Activision has stated its pleasure at the game's reception in a public statement, hoping to reassure fans</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's review</a> covers the whole package. In it, reviewer Jeremy Peel remarks: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

            <p>The brilliant Dispatch has reached another well deserved milestone.</p>
<p>The episodic superhero workplace comedy has now managed to move 2m copies. While developer AdHoc has <em>technically</em> celebrated the number of "players", the game is not available on any subscription service, so I would say this number also equates to sales.</p>

<p>Sharing the figure on social media, the studio wrote: "We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the two million players that have joined us so far.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be here without you."</p>
<p>The team accompanied the post with an image of Robert's chonky dog, Beef, which you can see below. He is such a good boy (I have many Beef screenshots saved on my PlayStation). </p>
<p>Needless to say, I <em>loved </em>my time with Dispatch, so I am thrilled to see the game having such success. I am going to replay the last couple of chapters, though, because there is one bit of my ending I am not too happy about… but I won't spoil anything here (Bertie and Connor have been getting an earful, though).</p>

			<p>If we rated things based solely on looks, the Gioteck WX5+ would immediately score top marks. This wireless controller for Switch, Switch 2 and PC boasts Hall Effect sticks and triggers and a pair of pro back buttons, but it’s the visual design that immediately grabs you. The delightful ‘Crayons’ livery is tied to RGB lighting, making this one of the most visually appealing controllers we’ve seen in a very long time.</p>
<p>At £24.99, Gioteck has also made one of the cheapest wireless controllers out there, especially considering all the features that Gioteck have crammed in. In terms of value, you’re simply not getting Hall Effect, programmable back buttons, RGB, a 3.5mm headphone socket, gyro and vibration anywhere else at this price point.</p>
<p>That budget pricing isn’t even immediately obvious when you pick it up. It is quite light in the hand, but the plastic that’s been used feels solid, and the textured grips help to keep it set in place.</p>



<p>While the Crayons livery is my personal favourite – who doesn’t want their controller to look like melted cake? – the other options are equally eye-catching, especially the 60s-flavoured Spiral and the multi-coloured mess of Doodle. If you’re a more serious type – or a teenage boy – there’s Dark Camo which is much more understated. There’s probably more chance of losing it, though.</p>

<p>Each of the analogue sticks houses colourful RGB rings as well, but it’s the performance of these Hall Effect sticks that’s most impactful. They’re pleasingly taut, returning to centre with a reassuring certainty, and they feel excellent in use. The Hall Effect tech should also mean that they are exceedingly long-lasting, outperforming standard potentiometer-equipped controllers that are more likely to suffer from stick drift.</p>

<p>The triggers are also Hall Effect, meaning that they’re a touch more accurate, while also benefiting from the frictionless tech. You can also switch them between analogue and digital performance, potentially cutting out a few more milliseconds of reaction time when playing shooters and other competitive titles, even without physical lockouts, which are ultimately the only thing the WX5+ is really missing. If you’re playing on Switch or Switch 2, the whole analogue trigger thing will be lost on you, but in a multi-platform house it’s a nice thing to have.</p>
<p>The only component that I’m not entirely sold on here is the cross-shaped D-pad. It feels too large under your thumb, and the left and right response feels slightly different. It didn’t cause any problems while playing, but there’s something about it that doesn’t feel as well-made as the rest of the WX5+. The other face buttons, and the shoulder buttons too, are reliable and responsive, and it’s just a bit odd that the D-pad feels as different as it does.</p>

<p>Around the back of the controller, there’s two programmable ‘pro’ buttons. These sit well under your middle fingers when you’re naturally gripping the controller, but with enough resistance to ensure you don’t accidentally activate them when you’re getting increasingly frustrated with purple shells ruining your peerless driving in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>The Gioteck WX5+ is practically a no-brainer in a household that’s looking for a great-value second controller, and it even makes a compelling cost-effective argument against the official Switch 2 Pro Controller as a daily driver. In the hand, there is an obvious difference in terms of quality, particularly in the plastics used, but when you’re in the midst of the action, the WX5+ is a deeply reliable performer.</p>
