There's a new <strong>Momotaro Dentetsu</strong> game in town, and it's another smash hit.</p>
<p>The Japanese exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/momotaro_dentetsu_2_anata_no_machi_mo_kitto_aru_-_higashi_nihon_hen_plus_nishi_nihon_hen">Momotaro Dentetsu 2: Anata no Machi mo Kitto Aru – Higashi Nihon Hen + Nishi Nihon Hen</a> has arrived with a bang on Switch and Switch 2, snatching up first and third spots on the software charts with a combined first week total of 147,513 sales. <em>Oof</em>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2guxowk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've been following these charts for a while, you'll remember that Konami's first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/momotaro_dentetsu_showa_heisei_reiwa_mo_teiban">Momotaro Dentetsu</a> board game took Japan by storm back in late 2020, even beating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> to the top spot — these <strong>Hyrule Warriors</strong> games can't catch a break against the Japan-exclusive series, can they?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> managed to sneak in and grab second place, but this all means that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, last week's champion, has fallen to sixth.</p>
<p>Things are rounded out by newbies <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a>, which managed to nab the last three spots.</p>

<p>Of course, all of those Momotaro Dentetsu sales have to go somewhere, and the hardware chart has shown booming numbers for the Switch 2 — shifting over 100,000 units this week. The rest of the order remains unchanged, with the three Switch SKUs combining for 22,736 sales, while the trio of PS5 models total in at 5,855.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Spike Chunsoft has announced that upcoming visual novel remake&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the West in 2026, and the company has shown off some of the changes coming to the revamped version of the classic game as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.spike-chunsoft.com/news/sgr_title_announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Spike Chunsoft says that a North American and European release of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is on the cards for next year, although the publisher stops short of announcing a specific month.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>, will serve as an enhanced remake of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, a visual novel that made its debut on the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2009. It'll feature "updated visuals and new narrative content", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to brand new background art that aims to stay faithful to the way the game's Akihabara setting would have looked in 2010, "created using extensive reference materials", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>New locations have been added to&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>in order to "complement and enrich the story", and new scenes have been added to "further a sense of immersion". Event stills have been reworked from the game's original storyboards to "deliver greater dramatic impact".</p>

<p>As well as all of the above,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will also boast a reworked UI that should make navigating the game a little easier. All told, it sounds like Mages and Spike Chunsoft are angling to make this the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-prism-peak-delayed-march-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opus-prism-peak-delayed-to-march-2026.1359634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sigono and publisher Shueisha Games have announced that upcoming narrative adventure game&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed once again, but at least we now know in which month it'll be launching next year.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1947910/view/585033008523771918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>will now be arriving in March 2026. It was originally slated for a 2025 release, but Sigono says that more time is needed to ensure the game "reaches the level of quality [the studio is] aiming for".</p>

<p>Sigono says the extra development time will allow it to polish the game further and ensure it's in a fit state for launch. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-delayed-may-2026" rel="nofollow">pretty standard reason</a> for games to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>, but hey - what's that oft-misattributed quote about delayed games and rushed games, again?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/opus-prism-peak-delayed-2026-eugene.jpg?itok=SMntnFaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/opus-prism-peak-delayed-2026-eugene.jpg?itok=q91snEYu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again, but it's got a new release window, at least.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is the latest title in Sigono's&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>series of narrative adventure games, which began in 2016 with&nbsp;<em>Opus: The Day We Found Earth</em>, followed by 2018's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-rocket-of-whispers-cleared-for-takeoff-on-switch-22nd-march" rel="nofollow">Rocket of Whispers</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Echo of Starsong</em>.</p>

<p>The games are loosely connected to one another by theme and atmosphere, but they don't tell a continuous story, so you won't need to have played previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>games to get the most out of&nbsp;<em>Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>when it eventually arrives.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak</em>, you'll play as a photographer stranded in a place known as the Dusklands alongside a mysterious young girl who's lost her memories. As you find your way home, you'll uncover the mysteries of the Dusklands and of your companion as well.</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>entries, you shouldn't expect high-octane action from this one; it'll be a contemplative narrative-led experience with an emphasis on photography, dialogue, and exploration.</p>




<p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947910/OPUS_Prism_Peak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, Switch 2, and Switch in March next year. You can try out a demo for the game on Steam right now if you want to get a feel for what it'll be like.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-is-being-made-free-for-owners-of-the-first-two-games.1359628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have announced that owners of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer I&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>II&nbsp;</em>(or both, of course) will soon be able to play&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign for free.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/86" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official Creative Assembly website, the developer says that starting from December 4th, all owners of the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series will gain access to Immortal Empires and its The Lost God prologue campaign at no extra cost.</p>

<p>What's more, even if you don't own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, you can still buy Immortal Empires-related DLC to play extra factions in the campaign mode, since you'll access the campaign through a new listing in your library (assuming you don't own the third game, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=PzNJIsGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=gLiw2Ui8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign will soon be free to owners of the first two games.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, if you already own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, then nothing will change for you, but this should make it easier for you to recruit some friends to enjoy Immortal Empires alongside.</p>

<p>This update also doesn't include any of <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i>'s other content, so if you want to play the Realms of Chaos campaign or experience any of the Legendary Lords, you'll need to buy the Upgrade Pack, which contains the aforementioned features, plus a couple of extras.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Immortal Empires campaign for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>launched in beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-immortal-empires-coming-in-august" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a>, eventually releasing in full for owners of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-update-24-brings-immortal-empires-to-all-players" rel="nofollow">the following February</a>.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly describes Immortal Empires as a "vast sandbox campaign encompassing the entire&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>world" and "the culmination of the entire&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series, so it's not just an extra; it's essentially the flagship feature of the newest game.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign is available now to everyone who owns the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, and it's also coming to owners of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/Total_War_WARHAMMER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer I</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">II</a>&nbsp;</em>on December 4th.</p>

GeForce Now Fast Pass will allow Chromebook owners to stream over 2,000 games directly from an existing PC game library without ads, and new Chromebook purchases will include a year’s membership for free.</p><p>Fast Pass looks similar to GeForce Now’s existing free plan, which includes the ability to stream more than 2,000 “Ready-to-Play” titles from a user’s existing Steam, Epic, or Xbox libraries. Unlike that plan, <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/geforce-now-fast-pass">the companies say</a> Fast Pass “has no ads,” and “allows you to skip the queue,” compared to typical waits of two minutes or more to start playing on the free plan.</p><p>There are other restrictions, with Fast Pass users limited to 10 hours of cloud gaming each month. Up to five of those can roll over to the next month if you don’t use them up though. Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">other paid plans</a>, which start at $9.99 per month, support a variety of other features, including higher resolutions, faster frame rates, RTX ray-tracing, and access to a larger game library bolstered by a couple of thousand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming">“Install-to-Play”</a> titles that must be installed onto Nvidia’s servers before you can access them.</p><p>Google says that anyone who purchases a new Chromebook will now get one year of GeForce Now Fast Pass included.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-motion-controlled-gaming-console-the-nex-playground-is-under-200-at-amazon-2000634139</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nex-playground-motion-controlled-gaming-console-hits-an-all-time-low-as-amazon-clears-out-remaining-stock-after-selling-10k-last-month.1359616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 2000s had the EyeToy. The 2010s had the Kinect. And now the 2020s have the Nex Playground. This play system will get you and the whole family up from the couch, moving and grooving while you play a variety of awesome games. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/">Thanks to Amazon’s Black Friday, you can grab the Nex Playground on sale. It’s currently 20% off.</a> That brings the price down from $249 to just $199, saving you an even $50. That ends up being less than half the price of the new Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Up and Moving to Play</h2>
<p>The Nex Playground is a plug-and-play gaming console built around motion controls. No controller necessary because your body is the controller. Just connect it to your TV over HDMI with the front camera pointed toward a space you’ve cleared enough in front of it for you to move around in. Depending on the game, up to four players can be up and out of their seats to play along together.</p>
<p>Out of the box, you’ll have access to five fun games. This includes <em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Whac-a-Mole</em>, and <em>Starri</em>. This may be enough to keep you entertained, but you can dive into a huge library of even more games with the Nex Playground Play Pass. Yu’ll gain access to new games each month, some of which feature famous and beloved characters from Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda and more. The full catalog includes over 30 games.</p>



<p>The Play Pass can be purchased separately from you Nex Playground. The three-month pass can be acquired for $49 while a full-year pass is set at $89. That works out to just a little over $7 per month. That cheaper than most streaming services go for nowadays. One Play Pass can be used on up to two Nex Playgrounds in the same household. Great for if you have one in the living room and then one in either a finished basement or kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>The Nex Playground is safe for kids and families as all content is made to be appropriate for all ages. No mature content, no in-app purchases, but best of all the system has no ads. It’s nice to be able to boot up a smart device in the year 2025 without being bombarded with advertising.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one-2000645764</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one.1359613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Roborock Q10 S5+ became <strong>Roborock’s best-selling model within hours of Black Friday starting</strong>&nbsp;and that makes perfect sense when you see the pricing. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">robot vacuum and mop combo just dropped to a record low of $259 on Amazon, down from its usual $549 (53% off)</a>&nbsp;while most other Roborock models sit between $600 and $1,000 even with Black Friday discounts.</p>
<p>Roborock built its reputation as a premium brand that competes directly with high-end options from iRobot and Ecovacs and their performance typically commands premium pricing. Robot vacuums solve the eternal problem of maintaining clean floors without dedicating hours to manual vacuuming and mopping each week. The <strong>Q10 S5+ combines 10,000Pa suction, 70-day self-emptying capacity, sonic mopping</strong>, and intelligent obstacle avoidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>70 Days of Truly Hands-Free Floor Cleaning</h2>
<p>The<strong> self-emptying station holds a 2.7-liter dust bag that stores debris for as long as 70 days</strong> before needing replacement. This capacity eliminates the weekly ritual of emptying dustbins that plagues basic robot vacuums and standard self-emptying models with smaller bags. Pet owners, in particular, benefit from the extended capacity since pet hair builds up fast and fills smaller dust containers in days. The station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin after each cleaning session, so you never touch dust or allergens during normal operation.</p>



<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction is serious cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair from carpets, lifts crumbs from hardwood grooves, and extracts debris from tile grout lines. This is much stronger than many upright vacuums provide and means this robot can deeply clean rather than just lightly maintain surfaces. Power is automatically adjusted based on floor type and debris detection and rampus up on carpets and dialing it back on hard floors to balance cleaning performance against battery life. A dual anti-tangle system utilizes a JawScrapers comb on the main brush, combined with specialized side brush design to prevent hair wrapping that stops cheaper robots dead in their tracks mid-clean.</p>



<p>The <em>VibraRise</em> 2.0 mopping system scrubs floors with<strong> sonic vibration at 3,000 oscillations per minute</strong>&nbsp;which generates actual cleaning action rather than just dragging a damp cloth across surfaces. This type of sonic scrubbing picks up dried spills, sticky residue, and ground-in dirt that static mopping systems leave behind. When transitioning onto carpets,<strong> it lifts the mop pad up to 8 mm</strong> and saves wet mopping pads from soaking rugs or carpet edges.</p>
<p><em>ReactiveTech</em> obstacle avoidance uses structured light technology that detects objects in its path and navigates with precision around them. The system <strong>identifies shoes, cables, pet toys, and furniture legs without bumping into them</strong> or getting stuck. This obstacle detection works in low-light conditions where camera-based systems struggle, maintaining reliable navigation during nighttime cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation <strong>scans rooms 360 degrees to create detailed maps</strong> that enable efficient cleaning patterns. It also supports multi-level mapping, remembering layouts for different floors in multi-story homes. The robot will plan an optimal cleaning route that can minimize the area of repeated coverage and reduce cleaning time. <strong>You can set no-go zones, invisible walls, and schedules for specific rooms</strong> with the Roborock app, giving you granular control over where and when the robot cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, the Roborock Q10 S5+ is less than half price while delivering features and performance that usually require spending upwards of $600. The fact that this became Roborock’s Black Friday bestseller in a matter of hours proves that buyers recognize exceptional value when premium performance falls to mid-tier pricing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode, REDSEC, is getting an esports competition, the Elite Series, featuring a $1 million prize pool in the first season from December 10 to January 18. </p>



<p>The Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series will kick off on December 10, 2025. Alongside the Elite Series, we will also see the launch of Open Series on December 12, 2025. The Open Series will be a competition for players of all skill levels, whereas the Elite Series will be the best REDSEC has to offer in the competitive phase. All competitions will feature cross-platform and cross-input environments, with players able to use a controller or mouse &amp; keyboard on PC or console. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Work?</h2>



<p>The new Elite Series will feature weekly competitive cash cups divided across three regions: The Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). 50 team captains from each region will be invited, each with a squad of 4, for a total of 600 competitors. </p>



<p>These 50 squads will go through a series of six REDSEC Battle Royale matches, which will end with the top eight squads battling head-to-head in a gauntlet. The format will be repeated over three Qualifying Match Days, with squads earning Elite Series Points for their performance.&nbsp;After this period, the top-25 squads will progress to the regional Season Finals. </p>



<p>All matches will be online, streamed by all competitors, and Battlefield Studios will host the Season Finals broadcast for each region. The Americas region will have a $50,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, as well as a $500,000 USD prize pool split across all participating squads in the Finals Gauntlet.&nbsp;The APAC and EMEA regions will have a $20,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, and a $285,000 USD prize pool for the Finals Gauntlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-season-1-schedule">Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Season 1 Schedule</h2>



<p>The start time for each season will be announced closer to the Qualifying match day, but here are the Match Day and Season Finals dates: </p>



<ul>
<li>Match Day #1 – Wednesday, December 10, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #2 – Thursday, December 11, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #3 – Tuesday, December 16, 2025</li>



<li>Season Finals – Thursday, December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-open-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Open Series Work? </h2>



<p>The Open Series will also be held in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Players can register their squads on <a href="http://repeat.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Repeat.gg</a> (see the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec?utm_campaign=battlefield_hd_ww_ic_ic_twitter_&amp;utm_content=1763655670&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> for more details), and on each match day, they can find the tournament code in the Repeat App. Scoring will be based on the cumulative 10 best Battle Royale and the 10 best Gauntlet matches played across all three Match Days. The top 250 teams will qualify from each region for the Season Finals, and the top 8 teams will qualify for next season’s Elite Series. </p>



<p>Open Series will feature a $30,000 prize pool, with $10,000 reserved for each region. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-open-series-schedule">Battlefield REDSEC Open Series Schedule</h2>



<p>Just like the Elite Series, the Open Series start times will be announced close to the day, but here are the Match Day and Season Finals dates: </p>

                <p>If you've been playing Grand Theft Auto Online long enough, you should have a pretty hefty amount of cash on hand. Next month, you'll be able to put that money to good use as the new update--A Safehouse in the Hills--introduces mansions that you can claim as your own.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taD8vci4fGI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/taD8vci4fGI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>These multi-million estates are under the purview of the Prix Luxury Real Estate company, which promises "sprawling grounds, breathtaking views, and first-rate amenities--including the latest in personal assistance and business service technology."

<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2129530/view/613180506112000708">have announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>13th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The highly-anticipated spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> (which was also handled by Tarsier Studios before handing the reins over to Supermassive Games for the third entry) will also gain a free demo in the coming weeks, just in case you want to try it out yourself before opting for the full game.</p>
<p>A $59.99 Digital Deluxe Edition will be available on launch, and this will include the base game, Season Pass, and the exclusive Foxhead and Muttonhead masks. Tarsier has also stressed that while this is primarily a co-op experience, solo players can also experience the game, with an AI taking on the role of your companion.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and we genuinely can't wait to dive in. For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Horror With Hope</strong> – In this unsettling tale, the emphasis is on tension and thick atmosphere, as you join the two orphans on a desperate search for hope and redemption in the direst of circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>- Across a Dark and Twisted World</strong> – Traverse an intriguing but terrifying world, where the main path is only one part of the fragmented story. Discover all sorts of mysterious locations on your perilous journey, each with its own story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>- A Dread-Filled Adventure</strong> – Tarsier Studios is bringing their unique visual style to bear on a whole host of new twisted monsters and broken, yet resilient, child characters. Fragments of the children’s troubled past have been used as inspiration for their character design, and for the monsters that now torment them.</p>
<p><strong>- Share the Scare</strong> – Nobody should be forced to go through hell alone! Fully playable in single player and local and online cooperative play, <em>REANIMAL</em> has a shared, directed camera, designed to maximize claustrophobia and tension.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Welcome to the coolest show in town, <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint. This is our daily roundup of video game news and other interesting stuff you might care about. Squeeze in, find a seat, and get ready to be blown away by this morning’s showcase, which includes bad news for fans of <em>The Finals</em> on PS4, more layoffs, Sakurai wanting to live a chill life, and more.</p> <h2>Some games that sold a single physical copy in October</h2> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">According to data from Circana’s Matt Piscatella</a>, some odd, old games sold exactly one new physical copy in the United States during October. If you were the person out there who bought a physical copy of <em>Spore</em> in October, email me a photo of the receipt. I want to talk to you about your life. I hope things turn around for you. And if you are the person who bought <em>Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em> on GBA last month, you are a wild individual, and I respect it. Here’s the full list:</p>

 <ul> <li>360- <em>Burnout Paradise</em></li> <li>3DS-<em> Carnival Games: Wild West 3D</em></li> <li>GBA-<em> Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em></li> <li>NDS- <em>Imagine Fashion Stylist</em></li> <li>PC- <em>Spore</em></li> <li>PS2-<em> Backyard Baseball</em></li> <li>PS3- <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em></li> <li>PS4- <em>Cooking Mama Cookstar</em></li> <li>XBX- <em>Ultra Bust A Move</em></li> </ul> <h2>Avalanche Liverpool closes, 31 devs laid off</h2> <p>In September, Avalanche Liverpool, the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">canceled Xbox game <em>Contraband</em></a>, announced it would be shutting down. And now that has happened. On November 19, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">the studio announced via its official website</a> that it had completely closed its doors and 31 developers had been laid off as a result.</p>

 <p>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project. We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios&nbsp;Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avalanchers through the transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.”</p>

 <h2>Leave <em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai alone</h2> <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html"><u>Game*Spark,</u></a> <em>Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai talked about how he doesn’t consider his life all that interesting and wishes people would just focus on the games and not who made them. So he was surprised that people wanted to turn his story into a manga.</p>

 <p>“I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life,” Sakurai told the outlet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros-and-kirby-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-its-best-to-just-play-games-instead-of-looking-at-who-made-them-so-please-dont-perceive-him/">as translated by <em>Gamesradar.</em></a> “Even with [being contacted about creating the manga], I’m sure my response was something like ‘really?'”</p>

 <p>“I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life. I think it’s best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Finals</em> on PS4 will be shut down next year</h2> <p>Before Embark Studios released the massively popular <em>Arc Raiders</em> last month, the company published the destructive shooter <em>The Finals</em> across consoles and PC. It wasn’t as big of a hit, but it’s still kicking and getting updates. But not for much longer on PlayStation 4, <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592?t=swsOGicwN1vsbqWO-_CZjg&amp;s=19">as confirmed by the studio earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>“When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring <em>The Finals</em> on PlayStation 4 and focusing our support on current generation hardware,” posted Embark Studios. “From that point on, you’ll need to play there to keep enjoying the game. Your progress and purchases will be stored in your Embark ID and will transfer to anywhere you choose to play. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been part of the PS4 community.”</p> <h2>Huh, Panic Button handled some Switch 2 port upgrades for Nintendo</h2> <p>Remember how, when the Switch 2 launched, some popular OG Switch games published by Nintendo, like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, got upgrades to look and play a bit better on the new machine? Well, turns out that Switch port experts Panic Button were contracted by Nintendo to handle those upgrades.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.  Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games. <a href="https://t.co/5P96V9DFUq">pic.twitter.com/5P96V9DFUq</a></p> <p>— Panic Button (Official) (@PanicButtonGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanicButtonGame/status/1991264499676930507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I find this very interesting, as it seems like something Nintendo could have done internally. But instead, they trusted the folks at Panic to handle the upgrades. I bet Panic is feeling very good about that right now, and it will likely help the studio get even more work porting games to the new Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><em>Deadpool VR</em> is perfect…for fans of Deadpool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495">MrBeast’s new “theme park” looks…uh…not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412">Critics seem to mostly like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="158" data-end="922">For PlayStation 5 owners who regularly find themselves bumping up against the console’s limited storage, keep reading. In the lead-up to Black Friday, Crucial has cut the price of one of its PS5-compatible SSDs, making it easier and more affordable to expand your game library.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/"> The 2TB Crucial P510 Gen5 NVMe SSD normally priced around $210 has been discounted by 29%, bringing the cost down to $150.</a> That’s a meaningful $60 reduction on a high-performance SSD equipped with its own heatsink for seamless compatibility right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="158" data-end="922">PS5 &amp; PC Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="924" data-end="1686">One of the most common frustrations among early PS5 adopters is the reality of the console’s internal storage limitations. Even though Sony technically lists the system as having an 825GB SSD, the usable space is significantly smaller. After accounting for system files and required software, players are left with roughly 667GB for game installs—a number that feels increasingly cramped as modern titles frequently climb past 100GB each. For anyone with a growing collection, or for those who enjoy bouncing between several big releases at once, that space disappears almost immediately. Installing Crucial’s 2TB expansion effectively triples the amount of room you have to work with, reducing the need to delete old favorites just to make space for new ones.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="2423">Beyond the raw storage boost, the drive is built to meet the PS5’s demanding performance standards. With read and write speeds up of to 11,000 MB/s, the Crucial P510 far exceeds what’s needed to keep pace with Sony’s ultra-fast architecture. The included heatsink, which is required for PS5 internal installation, helps maintain stable temperatures and prevent thermal throttling during extended gaming sessions.</p>


<p data-start="2425" data-end="3119">If you’re planning to install the Crucial P510 SSD into a PC gaming desktop, you’ll be able to make the most of its insanely fast read and write speeds. Just make sure your motherboard supports Gen5 NVMe SSDs. A Gen4 slot will still work with it, just won’t be able to reach the maximum speeds supported by the P510. With optimal conditions, you’ll be able to experience lightning fast load times in your games as well as when working with high-intensive applications such as when video or photo editing. Plus with a full 2TB, you’ll have plenty of room for not just your games, but any important pictures or vids you want to hang onto.</p>
<p data-start="3121" data-end="3308" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its generous performance, significant storage increase, and a timely discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/">Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive stands out as one of the most practical PS5 upgrades you can grab this season.</a></p>

              <p><i><span>Kirby Air Riders </span></i><span>is out today, and it sounds like the chaotic kart racer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412"><span>exactly what fans of the GameCube original wanted</span></a><span> (and like it’s probably not for anyone else). One of the ways the Switch 2 game embraces disorder is in its vehicle customization, which lets you paint your hoverboard to look like pretty much whatever you want. Some players are using this feature to make cool karts to race around in, and others are seeing what monstrosities they can put on the market for other players to use.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo has held </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><span>multiple feature-length Direct showcases</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, so we’ve already known about its vehicle customization for a while. I wouldn’t be surprised if fans were planning some of their vehicular shitposts for some time and just needed the game in their Switch 2s to finally bring them to life.

<p>The first gameplay trailer for Hellraiser: Revival has dropped, and it’s absolutely not for the faint of heart. If you thought the debut trailer was wince-worthy, this is just as nasty and as vile as you’d expect. It’s heaven, in hell.</p>



<p>A pleasant (also unpleasant) surprise dropped in July 2025 with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellraiser-revival-trailer-revealed-saber-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellraiser: Revival Trailer, revealed by Saber Interactive</a>. It marks the first time the horror title has ever had its own standalone game, and the first gameplay trailer shows that you should expect every bit of the nastiness of the movies rolled into one.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellraiser-revival-has-some-cenobite">Hellraiser: Revival Has Some Cenobite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Raise hell, and leave. Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on Gamescom preview</a> tells you everything you need to know about Hellraiser: Revival.</p>



<p>An “hour-long theater of violence and sadism” was one of many lines we used. Now, you can see the evidence for yourself through the first Hellraiser: Revival gameplay trailer. It has everything a Hellraiser fan is looking for: Nudity, graphic violence, and a sprinkling of Pinhead.</p>



<p>There’s also a lot of visceral combat, a look into the game’s brand-new story, and you also get a look at the game’s insistence on going the extra length with platforming and puzzling.</p>



<p>You can check out the footage for yourself, if you dare. All jokes aside, <strong>viewer discretion is advised</strong>.</p>

<p>An insider has stated that Resident Evil Requiem is definitely getting at least one DLC, which is currently in development. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem doesn’t arrive until next year, and as we wait for the game’s launch, the only things getting us by are leaks. We recently saw the producer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address rumours</a> about the photo of Leon Kennedy with an eye patch that surfaced online. Now, an insider has revealed some details about the DLC. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-dlc-might-star-alyssa">Resident Evil Requiem DLC Might Star Alyssa</h2>



<p>The details about the Resident Evil Requiem DLC come from Dusk Golem (Aesthetic Gamer), known for RE leaks. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1991047135551500624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states, “There’s definitely at least one DLC for Resident Evil Requiem in development right now. I’ve heard about it a few times, believe it stars Alyssa.” The leaker had previously stated that Alyssa Ashcroft is also the giant monster following Grace in the trailer, and will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for a bit</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Dusk Golem was also asked on the same day whether Leon Kennedy is being considered the main character or a side character in the upcoming title. Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1991130594076696831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a> that they don’t have a blueprint for the game to give that answer, but they do know that Leon has “some very large levels, the biggest in the series to date”. Players should take both details with a grain of salt, as it does not come from an official source. </p>







<p>In other news, Capcom expects Resident Evil Requiem to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village. Additionally, the developers recently revealed why they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-reveals-why-multiplayer-was-ditched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched the multiplayer aspect</a> of the title.

In a desperate act, she descends into the spirit world to fight for a second chance.</p><p>Minimalist in presentation but unafraid of raw, harrowing themes, <em>Death Howl</em> unfolds as a metaphorical journey through sorrow, <a title="Genres > Survival [483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and acceptance. It’s a hunt where every step forward carries a cost—and every enemy demands a study worthy of a huntress.</p><p>True to soulslike tropes, defeat is not the end, but part of the learning path. Resting revives fallen foes, and understanding enemy behavior is crucial to progress. <em>Death Howl</em> enhances this structure with tactical, grid-based combat, deck-building systems, and action-RPG exploration across eerie, hostile biomes.</p><p>Each region introduces not just new enemies and active and passive abilities, but also new cards that offer deck-tailoring possibilities, allowing players to shape their tactical approach as they progress. Every fallen spirit adds to Ro’s strength in this quiet war of grief and resolve.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">Midnight expansion</a> is bringing sweeping changes to the MMORPG's transmog system, but they look to be far more expensive than players were led to believe.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year when Midnight was fully revealed, developer Blizzard announced it would be overhauling the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-finally-making-transmog-much-cheaper-and-more-convenient/1100-6534017/" data-ref-id="1100-6534017">cosmetic outfit system in a way that would save players gold</a>. Instead of having to pay gold to transmog individual gear pieces, players would instead transmog gear slots. That slot would then retain its appearance regardless of whatever item was equipped, useful as players level up and equip new gear over the course of an expansion or season.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Sounds good on paper. However, the system is now testable on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-beta-details-shared-by-blizzard/1100-6535837/" data-ref-id="1100-6535837">WoW: Midnight beta</a>, and as broken down by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/it-costs-5-700-gold-to-save-a-full-set-of-transmog-to-an-outfit-slot-in-midnight-379350" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, players are discovering these supposedly cost-saving changes are actually extremely expensive.</p><p dir="ltr">At Midnight's level cap of 90, equipping a full transmog gear outfit costs around 5,700 gold, over four times more expensive than it is to equip that same set in the game right now. That means that unless a player changes their full set of gear five times, the current system is actually cheaper.</p><p dir="ltr">Transmog costs actually scale with level as well, so players will want to save their transmogs at lower levels to save on gold costs. It should be noted that players can save an appearance set for free just as they currently do, but actually equipping that set is where the gold costs comes in.</p><p dir="ltr">Outfit slots, a new feature in Midnight, also cost money. These are essentially saved transmog sets where players can go ahead and pay the transmog fee and then save that outfit for later use without having to pay the gold cost again. While players will be given two slots for free, additional slots (up to 20) cost increasingly more gold. The first few are hardly noticeable, with slot three costing 100 gold, slot four costing 500, and slot 5 costing 1,000. From there the gold costs begin to increase rapidly, with the last three slots costing 100,000 gold each.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the costs is the fact that outfits slots aren't account-wide and are instead on a per-character basis. For players who want multiple outfits on multiple characters, the gold costs begin to add up rather quickly, potentially costing millions of gold for those who want all 20 slots on multiple characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Outfit slots are mostly for players who want to be able to jump between transmog outfits frequently, and will work with the game's new "Situations" system. In this new system, players can change between their saved outfits automatically depending on the circumstances, and have a different appearance based on specific activities, like a cozy outfit when they are at their house or a different one when out in the open world or doing dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who change outfits often, the new system does technically save players gold. But for others who use transmog more casually, it could actually be more expensive. It's also a far more confusing system--one where players will now need to weigh the costs of buying new outfit slots and saving transmog sets versus overriding an existing set in an effort to save gold.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that all these prices are on the Midnight beta and will likely change before the expansion launches early next year, especially given the negative reception from players. But considering this feature was pitched as saving fashion-forward players money, as opposed to costing more, this feels like Blizzard took an easy win and instead turned it into a loss.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">early access to the game's housing system</a> will arrive on December 2. Blizzard recently found itself in another controversy when it revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/" data-ref-id="1100-6536042">premium currency</a> that will be used just for housing items on WoW's in-game shop, despite other items like mounts and transmog sets having always been sold for real currency.</p>

Then, from 2014 to 2021, exit rates for video game firms were much lower than those for all other private employer firms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The conclusion by Statistics Canada is that studio closures in the Canadian video games industry are "relatively rare."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sadly, as we've seen in recent years, that metric appears to be changing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="984f7facfc1a1"><a title="Pokémon Forest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/984f7facfc1a1/pokemon-forest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you may already be aware, <strong>PokéPark Kanto</strong> is officially opening to the public on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. The Pokémon-branded theme park will be a permanent fixture in Yomiuriland in Tokyo's Tama Hills, and will be divided into two core areas: Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you have limited mobility, then you might not be allowed into the Pokémon Forest area at all. Yes, as covered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-you-walk-up-110-steps-without-help-the-pokmon-theme-park-in-japan-has-some-strict-safety-rules-that-could-exclude-many-visitors">IGN</a>, the <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/ticketInfo/type/index">official PokéPark website</a> states that those "unable to climb 110 steps without assistance" will not be allowed to enter. In addition, the Japanese site states that those who require the use of a wheelchair will also be restricted. Understandably, the site clarifies that this is "to ensure visitor safety".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftjskwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Of course, it's not entirely surprising given the nature of the attraction. The Pokémon Forest is described as a 500m long nature trail featuring steep hills, tunnels, and stairs, and the site even says that visitors should expect "grassy areas and uneven paths". Children under 5 will also not be allowed to take part, even if accompanied by an older guest. Inclement weather may also lead to the suspension of the attraction altogether.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals for which any of the following applies cannot enter:</p>
<p>Those under the influence of alcohol, with heart conditions, who are pregnant, with high or low blood pressure, who are feeling unwell, who are unable to climb 110 steps without assistance, and those with conditions or symptoms that may worsen by using the park.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sedge Town, meanwhile, will offer up a whole bunch of additional attractions, including rides, stores, and Sedge Gym, where attendees can watch Pokémon stage shows. You'll also have a chance to connect with other 'Pokémon Trainers' at the Primarina Fountain.</p>
<p>So it sounds like there's at something for everyone at PokéPark Kanto, even if you won't be able to access the Pokémon Forest. Tickets will be available for Japanese residents from 21st November and issued via a lottery system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest</em> has been having a renaissance with the recent releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>. These remakes garnered high praise among the masses for revitalizing three iconic classics for the modern era, and make no mistake—Square Enix has every intention of continuing to deliver amazing, creative remakes of timeless classics with the upcoming release of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>. This game is sure to stun audiences with its beautiful hand-crafted 3D art style, modern gameplay features, and heartwarming story.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is based on the original PlayStation title released in 2000 in Japan, then remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and focuses on the adventures of a group of childhood friends who leave their home of Estard Island to embark on a high-stakes adventure across the seas and through time itself to battle against unknown, evil forces and discover the mysteries of their world.</p>

<p>My one-hour hands-on experience with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>&nbsp;showed off a delightful game full of charm and mystique while also embodying the same fun, lighthearted spirit that made the original <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> such a well-revered title among fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=HhIbPh8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=jgVGCfKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I started my time in the demo in Wetlock, a small town playing host to a traveling musician named Old Man Riffer. When I entered the village, Old Man Riffer was entertaining the villagers with his torban before quickly trying to leave despite the villagers' protests. At night, while staying in the inn, a haunting melody began to play, opening portals that spirit away the villagers into the unknown, prompting the party to investigate the strange disappearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When traversing the continent in search of answers, I found myself stumbling across Spliton-on-Sea, an abandoned fishing village that exhibited signs of being plagued by the same mystery as Wetlock. While exploring the map and interacting with important locations, the playable characters would trigger opportunities to talk to certain characters to get their thoughts on current events and helpful hints on where to go next.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found my way to Highendreigh Tower and began uncovering the truth behind the disappearances in Wetlock and Spliton-on-Sea, which led to the sudden appearance of Gracos the Demon King, who submerged the entire small island continent in water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever played a <em>Dragon Quest</em> game before or if you’re new to the franchise, the mechanics are easy to catch on to. Players get four basic commands: Attack, which launches a basic attack with your equipped weapon; Skills, which allows players to chose from a variety of abilities and spells that can be used by each character based on their growth and class; Items that can be used to to heal and buff players or attack and debuff enemies; and Defend to reduce damage from incoming enemy attacks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=vhTcCOro 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=YR950owq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Let Loose ability has also been added to <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, which activates after a character has been worked up during combat to allow them to unleash a powerful attack or skill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> also introduces the brand-new feature called Moonlighting, where the player can assign an additional class to each playable character to gain special abilities and skills to the playable characters. These additional classes can be changed at-will while playing without having to go anywhere special, like a church, inn, or checkpoint to change that additional vocation, and I found it really fun to be able to switch them whenever to create different strategic combinations before heading into battle.</p>

<p>One of my favorite characters to utilize was Aishe, who had Destiny’s Dancer as one of her vocations, giving her access to M-Pathy, a powerful healing spell.</p>

<p>I also had her as a Troubadour, which allowed her to cast Divine Intervention to prevent the party from experiencing instant death from an attack. This combination made her a powerhouse healer while still being effective at offensive attacks with her sword. Ruff, Maribel, and the protagonist also had their own combination of unique spells and abilities in the demo, and being able to mix and match to address any combat situation helped to keep the game refreshing and engaging.</p>

<p>The second location available in the demo was Emberdale at an earlier part of the game, which allowed me the chance to play as Kiefer, the Prince of Estard, alongside Maribel and the protagonist. When the party arrived in Emberdale, the town had been experiencing strange tremors from the volcano near their town, so they started preparations for the Flaming Festival to give fire back to the volcano as a tribute in hopes of stopping it from erupting.</p>

At night, the townsfolk go to the volcano and begin feeding it their flames, but it slowly awakens the Glowering Inferno, a fire-based monster that had been living inside the volcano with plans to destroy the continent Emberdale sits on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle against the Glowering Inferno felt tense due to the limited abilities the party had access to in this demo, but it may also have to do with the fact that I sped down to the bottom of the volcano without fighting many enemies along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties of the battle, various vocational abilities aided in making the battle easier to progress through. The protagonist had the Fledgling Fisherman vocation, which allowed him to use Ocean’s Devotion, an ability that made it so each ally would neutralize the next attack that targeted them.</p>

<p>Maribel, as a Mini Mayoress, could use Shewrd Operator, which allowed her to see through enemy resistances to make elemental attacks more effective. Keifer with the Heir Apparent vocation would cast Royal Flush, which reduced his defense stats while significantly increasing his attack power and critical hit chances.&nbsp;</p>

The beautiful diorama-esque style makes it feel like the player is looking down on a miniature world while moving around living-breathing maquettes rather than just simple 3D models.</p>

<p>It makes sense given Square Enix scanned in hand-crafted, super-detailed dolls of all of the main playable characters to give the game its unique, distinct art style, differentiating it from other Dragon Quest games while still embodying the charm of the character designs illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>As I finished my time with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, I couldn’t help but wish I could have played even more because of how much fun I was having. There were also plenty of hidden mysteries within the demo that I wished I had the chance to find and experience, but that just means I have plenty to look forward to when the game comes out next year, and fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for a new turn-based RPG will also have plenty to enjoy and explore, too.</p>

              <p>Dedicating individual wall outlets to each device creates outlet scarcity and cable chaos, especially when you need to charge your laptop, phone and wireless earbuds simultaneously. The Baseus <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">2-pack 65W USB-C charger blocks just hit a record low of $29 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $49 price (42% off)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Each charger includes three ports</strong> that let you power multiple devices from a single outlet and getting two chargers for under $30 total makes this deal borderline ridiculous. These Baseus chargers use <strong>GaN technology to pack 65W of power into a compact form</strong> factor that’s 41% smaller than traditional chargers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Split Three Ways or Full Power to One Device</h2>
<p>This intelligent power distribution system <strong>delivers the full 65W to a single connected device or splits the total wattage across multiple ports</strong>, depending on the needs of each. You can fast-charge a MacBook Air at maximum speed when it’s the only device plugged in, reaching 50% battery in roughly an hour. Connect your laptop, phone, and AirPods simultaneously and the charger will apportion the right wattage to each device automatically. Using Power Delivery protocols, the system automatically negotiates with each device for optimal charging speeds without user intervention.</p>



<p>Each charger has<strong> two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong>, which covers modern devices and old gadgets that haven’t migrated to USB-C. The dual USB-C configuration will handle laptops, tablets, recent phones, and any other device that charges using USB-C Power Delivery. The USB-A accommodates older phones, wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and accessories still using the old USB connector.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride technology enables such compact sizes because it runs much cooler and more efficiently than traditional silicon-based chargers. As a result, the GaN chip realizes an impressive 92% energy conversion rate which means less power goes to waste as heat, and more directly into charging your devices. Improved thermal management allows Baseus to fit more power into a smaller package without overheating concerns. Even during three-port full-speed running, <strong>the charger remains cool to the touch</strong> and reduced heat generation prolongs the service life of the charger.</p>



<p>The <strong>compact design is 41% smaller than Apple’s original 61W MacBook charger</strong>, while it offers more total power across more ports. That size reduction makes a real difference when packing for trips or trying to cram chargers into crowded power strips. Foldable prongs collapse flat against the charger body, preventing them from snagging on bag contents or scratching other devices.</p>
<p>Built-in safety mechanisms <strong>protect against overcharge, overheating, short circuits, and power surges</strong>. Chargers constantly monitor temperature, voltage, and current, automatically shutting down when any of these becomes unsafe. These protect the batteries in your devices from being damaged and eliminate fire hazards caused by malfunctioning charging equipment.</p>
<p>At $29 for two complete 65W three-port chargers, this Black Friday deal brings the cost down to $14.50 per charger and undercuts single-port chargers from lesser-known brands. You get GaN efficiency, 65W total output, three-device simultaneous charging, universal protocol support, and compact travel-friendly design for 40% off.</p>
