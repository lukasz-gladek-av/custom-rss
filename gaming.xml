OhSnap, the company behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262221/this-40-magnetic-phone-grip-does-what-popsockets-cant-and-its-on-sale">the excellent magnetic PopSocket alternatives I showed you in October</a>, is now officially turning his design into the coolest looking gamepad attachment I’ve ever seen for a phone: </p></div><p>It’s no taller or wider than an iPhone, so it should slide into a pocket. It’s got a MagSafe pattern of magnets to attach it to your magnetic ring device. You don’t have to remove it to use your phone like a phone, because the whole gamepad retracts underneath<em>,</em> a little like the slide-out keyboard phones (or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452167/sony-xperia-play-2-playstation-phone-prototype-concept-leaked-images">PlayStation Phones</a>) of old — and now, it’s mounted on a spring-loaded arm that pops out at the push of a button and also slightly angles your device towards your face.</p><div><figcaption><em>The OhSnap Mcon’s hinge in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video by Josh King / OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>OhSnap even found room for a pair of Nintendo Switch-esque analog sticks, with drift-resistant Hall effect sensors, and pair of fold-out grips so you can (theoretically) hold it more like a full-size gamepad. The sticks are clickable buttons, and it’s got a full set of shoulder buttons and triggers as well.</p><div><figcaption><em>An illustration with the grips unfolded.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>Two months ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Retro Game Corps</a> came away <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3969hkkFSE">impressed with a prototype</a>, and it seems King has been <em>very</em> busy since then. As he explains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIgugX2gODE">on YouTube</a>, he initially tried to start his own company around the gamepad, even attracted a few investors, manufactured some boards and was working toward injection molding, before he started running out of money and reached out to OhSnap about a partnership.  </p><p>Speaking of money, we don’t have any idea how much it’ll cost, particularly at retail — OhSnap is planning to launch a Kickstarter on January 2nd to raise funds. <a href="https://ohsnap.com/pages/mcon-signup-page">It’s taking signups here for now</a>.</p><p>I should be getting my own hands on a prototype next month at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, and I’ll let you know how it feels. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(not pictured: Ira Crosby) <a href="https://t.co/snfI2KiM27" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/snfI2KiM27</a></p>— Erik Wolpaw (@Wolpaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wolpaw/status/1870213443221106918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Did you know the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was one hundred and ninety nine years late? Literally everyone alive when construction started was dead by the time it finished," The Team Fortress 2 team writes in a <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=235677" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post </a>announcing the new issue. A perhaps more extreme example of something taking a long time to complete than this comic, but an apt analogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans of Team Fortress 2, you'll find the gang all here including a newly married Soldier and even a maskless Spy. The issue also has a dedication to Rick May, the voice of Soldier who died in 2020 at the age of 79. The story itself concludes a long, winding journey that TF2 fans have been waiting a long time to see updated, so I won't spoil the rest of the comic here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comics have served as an invaluable tome to find out more about the different TF2 characters, especially background characters like Miss Pauling and The Administrator. The comics are very much worth a full read if you haven't checked them out already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve is continuing the trend of emerging from what seems like some kind of gaming hibernation, first with the release of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> and the testing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valve-steam-announcement-page">new hero shooter, Deadlock</a>. This new comic issue serves that Valve creatives are still tinkering in the background, working on new stories for our favorite games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we salvage a few diamonds from a whole mess of rough.</p><p>As we’ll be celebrating with our families next week, this one’s technically our last show of the year.

Oh, and we discuss Riley’s holiday gaming dilemmas, all of which would be solved if he just bought a Steam Deck.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can create a future in which the worst games media moment of the year is, like, “So-and-so published a kind of silly piece” and not “Everything’s on fire, and the fire got exponentially bigger while we were handing it its award.”</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I want to start with the best games media moment, and a moment that demonstrated the continued usefulness of the media even in its diminished state: Dr Disrespect. We had that <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outing</a> from a former Twitch employee of what he probably did [to get banned from Twitch in 2020], and then both Ash Parrish and Cecilia D’Anastasio <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaped into action and managed to verify it</a>. That’s what took it from being this bit of hearsay to a story that had actual ramifications that brought down what was at the time the Dr Disrespect empire.&nbsp;</p><p>He unfortunately <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-rumble-conor-mcgregor-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bounced back with a Rumble deal</a>, but we kinda all saw that coming. I even <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a piece</a> about how that was probably gonna happen. But his credibility in the eyes of any sort of mainstream establishment was obliterated – and justifiably so. He had inappropriate interactions with a minor. You should not be able to come back from that – at least not in any way where you get accepted by major brands and platforms.</p><p>It was impressive reporting, and it was good to see both of those reporters get their dues in some ways – though I’m sure people also came after them and were shitty because that’s the nature of being a reporter in the year 2024. But they did the thing. They made it happen.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I’ve got a good one. Was <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-creators-guild-union-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the IGN union</a> this year?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yes it was.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, that’s a good one.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The IGN union has been really cool, with the caveat that clearly management has been combative in certain ways. They did those <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ign-management-lays-off-three-union-members-in-massive-breach-of-trust-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird layoffs of a few union members</a>.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I was just explaining last night to a friend who isn’t in journalism the whole IGN <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying Gamer Network</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs and buyouts situation</a>, and they were like “What? How is that allowed that one company can own all the websites?” And I was like “Well, you see…” And as we’ve discussed a million times on this podcast, a union can’t do everything, but some folks are lucky to have that.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>And I will say, if you look at those buyouts [that management is offering to staff], the terms are pretty healthy. People are getting between four and six months of severance, as well as COBRA [insurance] coverage. It’s understandable why a lot of people are taking that buyout, and I would imagine the union – even just its existence, if nothing else – played a role in obtaining that buyout package. It’s not ideal, but it is something.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> We’ve done a lot of writing this year about the crappy <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conditions</a> at various websites, and those things might still exist even if those websites had unions, but unions can definitely fight them. As we go into 2025 – and as we were just talking about, who knows what the state of organized labor will be under Trump – but it’s definitely something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> OK so, now it’s time for the bad moments. There are plenty to choose from! I think I’m gonna say it’s a tie between <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer getting shut down</a> and kind of <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything that’s happened to Kotaku</a>, but especially when [editor-in-chief Jen Glennon] resigned over the editorial edict to produce exponentially more guides. I think that was kind of the flashpoint for pretty much everything that was to come.</p><p>With Game Informer, the immediate tragedy was obvious, and it had ripple effects in that, as I understand it, the Game Informer Vault – which contained a lot of material video game history – ended up becoming the plaything of one of these fucking GameStop execs.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I wrote <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gamestop-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a blog about that</a>.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>He has a bunch of their stuff in his office and whatnot, which is awful. What a waste. And of course, tons of people out of work very suddenly. Another publication bites the dust – one that was relatively well funded. They did some work that verged on being in the realm of advertorial, but nonetheless, they also did some really good work, some really interesting stuff. Game Informer was foundational for me; I read it all the time growing up. I have crystal clear memories of where I was when I was reading particular issues. It’s that much of a thing. So its demise was super tragic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The revival of former Vice properties is not great, but also it’s just kind of a bummer more than actively [bad for the world]. It’s embarrassing. Twenty percent of me was like “I get getting that paycheck, but that’s really <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad writing</a>.” Who is this for? Why are you doing this? What are you getting out of this? You’re just doing SEO manipulation at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>I kinda understand what would make someone think they could salvage an unsalvageable website, because it is such a brand that you were aware of. It’s not as bad as the Kotaku thing, because the Kotaku thing a) is personal, and b) is actively harming people now. Whereas I’ve heard the Remap folks talk about [Waypoint’s revival], and they’re kind of whatever about it. They got a good deal. They got to keep the feed. They got out.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s comical, more than anything. I’ve been looking at Shane Smith’s presence, because [Vice] brought him back. Again, who is that for? It’s like a more Gen X-y Bill Maher but with less of the appeal. The YouTube channel Vice had – which hundreds of people built; they sent people all over the world – is now just “Hot Ones” without [Sean Evans].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> They’re still making videos! I just watched one about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHCPMDLzIA4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Axie Infinity</em></a>. I was curious about what crypto games were doing about Trump being into crypto, and I found a Reddit post of the <em>Axie Infinity</em> people being really excited that search interest in<em> Axie Infinity</em> had spiked. I was trying to figure out why, and they had traced it back to a Vice YouTube from last month or something, and I was like “Vice still has a YouTube channel?”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, they do, and you should tune in if you’d like to see Shane Smith interview [noxious streaming personality] Destiny.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sandisk-logo-rebrand"><h3>Congratulations To Sandisk On A Rebranding That Rules</h3></a><p>More brands should look like they sell Laserdisc players</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silo-apple-tv-architecture-politics-world"><h3>I Want To Live In The Silo</h3></a><p>You can plot the entire course of a human life in this universe</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames"><h3>A Wheezy Indiana Jones Is Incredibly Relatable</h3></a><p>'Always knew someday you’d come unlocking, opening then walking back through my door'</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Although December is quickly coming to a close, the update adds more than enough winter-themed distractions to keep players preoccupied for weeks to come. Highlights include various Christmas decorations and maps, hidden presents to find, a new Gold Shop, and Leaderboard Season 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those hopping into Anime Defenders after the Christmas Update will first notice the snow, presents, and trees that now pollute the lobby. These are more than just festive trinkets, though, as the added clutter has been used to carefully hide presents that, once acquired, unlock some of those new maps. Completing additional Santa Claus quests can unlock even more goodies, with daily quests also gifting players with rewards should they continue to log in between now and December 26. There's also a limited Christmas Banner, which contains six new units to collect.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/anime-defenders-1734476101342.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Defenders Christmas Update is available now.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to every new holiday item added as part of the Anime Defenders Christmas Update, players can take advantage of a new trading currency: Emerald.

But like I've said before, the year also had its lows where even established franchises like Dune, Like a Dragon, Mario and plenty of others had a hard time sticking the landing between their multiple releases this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And like the content we consume, we as humans are also subject to ups and downs throughout the year, and we know everyone has their good and bad days. But it's time to recognize the most outstanding members of our community -- the users that more often than not exemplify the best parts of our community. We enjoy celebrating them for all they do to create a positive atmosphere here at IGN. From users who comment daily to those who visit sparingly, we are grateful for your passion for and dedication to having spirited conversations with your fellow community members.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They say good things come in threes, so to celebrate our third year of fostering a positive and inclusive environment for all members we're once again paying tribute to our top users based on their accounts and how they interact with others in the community. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/08/commentsoftheweek-blogroll-01-1649456618377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year we celebrated and rewarded 11 upstanding members of our community, with of a portion of them maintaining a perfect comment record. Those members were<strong> Midori85, 1track, wuzzgoodhommy, tenken8, ForceStream, CurryLova, Doctor_MG, NDWest14, McGarnicle, TAGibby4, and Real Frowns. </strong>To up the ante this<strong> </strong>year we will be celebrating 15 users! Check back next week when we unveil the best-performing members of the community that topped the comment charts.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The winners will all be receiving a gift of IGN Plus as a way of saying thank you, so keep an eye out for our update early next week, and for our winners an e-mail detailing how to redeem your gift. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">IGN Community Voted Awards</h2><p

In nine of the 13 categories, the winners garnered over 40% of the total votes, so while some of you may be prone to spirited debates, a large portion of you agreed on your 2024 favorites. We even have blowouts in a few categories: Silent Hill currently has over 80% of the votes for Best Horror Game, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has over 67% of the votes for the Best Xbox Game. The closest category you voted on was the Best Game of 2024, which was decided by less than 1500 votes, cementing Black Myth: Wukong as the IGN audience's favorite over Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, which are tied for second. And while Game of the Year was the most-voted category this year, the Best TV Show category was just behind it in total votes and, despite the resentment we often hear around recent Marvel projects, it was Agatha All Along that took the win with 27.5% of the votes, beating out popular shows like Shogun, Fallout, and The Penguin. Again, thank you to everyone who joined in on the fun; we look forward to seeing how 2025 turns out. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Keepin' It Clean</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, we have also been monitoring those on the opposite end of the spectrum who do not foster a positive experience. We remove the most problematic users regularly to improve everyone's overall experience. But we also use this time before the end of the year as an opportunity to remove those who were given more time to see if their infractions throughout the year created a pattern or were potentially just someone having a bad day or week. So, in addition to recognizing the users who uplifted our community, we have also removed several users who have consistently violated our community guidelines. These banned accounts are those who have engaged in hate speech, harassment, or other toxic behaviors. We know these actions are not always popular, but they are necessary in our commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone at IGN. With that being said we will be updating the ToS in 2025, so be sure to check them out once those go live in early January. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue to build upon our community, we will continue to monitor and address any problematic behavior to ensure that our community remains a positive and inclusive place for everyone. We can create a respectful, supportive, and enjoyable community by working together. Keep an eye out in 2025 as we have even more plans for the community to ensure we are fostering a welcoming space for everyone and hopefully a few surprises.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We appreciate our readers who regularly make us their home for gaming, entertainment, and more. We are excited to continue building and improving together in the coming months and years. Once again, thank you to all of you who regularly do your best to create a positive experience on IGN. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the live-action adaptation of Sega’s speedy platformer is entering a new era. With each subsequent movie, the <em>Sonic </em>films have sought to shed the generic “family” movie image for one that was more honest to the anime-inspired twists and turns of the long-running platformer series. And this latest film succeeds. <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of the most beloved stories in all of the series’ 30 years. While the film does tweak some things along the way, it doesn’t shy away from the otherworldly, supercharged melodrama that differentiated <em>Sonic </em>from its contemporaries in the early 2000s. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>still falls into the occasional trap of talking down to the all-ages audience with low-hanging jokes and some frankly groan-worthy segments, but more than ever, the third film earns the right to delve into the video game excess that made these characters so beloved in the first place.</p><p>While there are a few lapses in judgment, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s greatest strength is that it prioritizes its nonhuman characters, rather than sidelining them in service of the less-interesting humans. After the colossal letdown of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><em>Knuckles </em>series’ human-centric story</a></span>, I was relieved to see <em>Sonic 3</em> not only focus on the anthropomorphic aliens, but also give them some of their best material yet. Keanu Reeves’ Shadow is the heart of the film. Though his backstory differs slightly from the games, the same throughlines of grief and vengeance flows through him. Reeves’ performance in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-keanu-reeves-dlc-tokyo-stage-1851720674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-keanu-reeves-dlc-tokyo-stage-1851720674"><em>Shadow Generations </em>tie-in DLC</a></span> was rough, but his soulful delivery in the film carries the heavy weight Shadow bears in the darkest stories the movies have told.</p><p>Though the specifics are slightly different, <em>Sonic 3</em> draws heavily from the dueling character perspective of the game it draws most from, <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. The movie takes most of that game’s key components, effectively delineating the movie into two tones depending on which speedy hedgehog is at the center of any given scene. The moments when Shadow is the focus are as contemplative and evocative as the ones in his debut in the Dreamcast game two decades ago. Sonic’s scenes, meanwhile, are cheerful and optimistic, with the angst of Shadow’s darker story bleeding through as the movie attempts to examine both characters’ reactions to loss.</p><figure id="" data-id="a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-recommend-id="image://a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-recommend-id="image://a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The clear duality <em>Sonic 3 </em>draws between Sonic and Shadow is what makes the film a more intentional video game adaptation than the previous films. More than just bringing in familiar characters and lore, <em>Sonic 3</em> actively adapts the structure and symmetry of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> to great effect. Though the movie sadly is missing a key player, as Rouge the Bat doesn’t appear in <em>Sonic 3</em> as some speculated, the asymmetry between Sonic and Shadow, even as they appear to be equal in strength and skill, is the clearest sign of a directorial intent that was too nebulous before. <em>Sonic 3 </em>sheds most of the cheesy distractions from previous films, like <em>Sonic 2</em>’s wedding subplot or the inane pop culture references that have plagued these movies. Instead, the film is clearly in pursuit of something that feels true to the source material and doesn’t always talk down to the kids in the room. Surprisingly enough, the movie is one of the most poignant explorations of Sonic and Shadow’s contrast, coming off years of Shadow being treated like a bit player. It respects its characters enough to not water down the darkest parts of who they are. Well, it does so for the protagonists, at least.</p><p>While I loved Sonic and Shadow’s rivalry, I didn’t expect to come out of <em>Sonic 3</em> soured on Jim Carrey’s performance as Doctor Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik. Carrey plays two roles in the film, reprising his role as the eccentric mad scientist, and Eggman’s grandfather, Gerald Robotnik. Gerald has had an important but mostly posthumous role throughout the <em>Sonic </em>series, and I was wary of Carrey’s portrayal of him in the trailers as the movie seemed to be taking a more humorous approach to a character notoriously known for some of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLsYuzCkZo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLsYuzCkZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spine-chilling moments</a></span> in the franchise. Gerald is alive and well(?) in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and it gives Carrey the opportunity to mostly riff with himself. While both characters have their moments, most of these films’ greatest sins are on display while the Robotniks are on screen. These moments are where you’ll find the needle drops, an unexpected dance break, and all the unfunny bits that come off like an adult writing for children they don’t believe could grasp something even slightly sophisticated. Almost all of that falls under Carrey’s screen time and feels like a waste of his talents and the mad scientists he plays.</p><figure id="" data-id="29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-recommend-id="image://29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-recommend-id="image://29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Paramount’s overreliance on human characters has been one of the most glaring issues of the <em>Sonic </em>films. Capable actors playing Sonic’s human friends were often given the worst material in the script and it made even the shortest scenes feel excruciatingly long. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t innocent of this, as <em>Jessica Jones </em>actor Krysten Ritter joins the cast as GUN agent Director Rockwell who mostly exists as a temporary obstacle for everyone before being quickly shuffled off the board. The <em>Knuckles </em>series might as well have not been named as such, as Idris Elba’s take on the beloved Echnida was barely in the show. For two movies, it felt like Carrey’s unhinged, show-stealing performance as Eggman was immune to this, but the movie does such an otherwise good job of keeping the focus on Sonic and Shadow that those distracting, low-effort propensities funneled into his performance instead of elsewhere.</p><p>The best human interactions in <em>Sonic 3 </em>are the ones that come back to its two leads, such as Alyla Browne’s role as Shadow’s best friend Maria, or Sonic’s father/son relationship with James Marsden’s small-town cop Tom. Lee Majdoub also gives an earnest performance reprising his role as Agent Stone dealing with his toxic relationship with the ol’ Egghead. But so much of the job of distracting children with zany antics falls at Carrey’s feet. It robs him of the wit and comedic timing that he had in the first two films. I’m sure he was having a blast on set, but he deserved better than what he had to work with.</p><figure id="" data-id="934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-recommend-id="image://934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-recommend-id="image://934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of that friction only happens because Gerald is alive in this version of the tale, and it’s not the only difference even the most casually engaged <em>Sonic</em> fan will notice. There are a few key changes from game to film that long-time fans will notice, but overall, <em>Sonic 3</em> goes out of its way to preserve the AMV-bait vibes of the series’ early-00s angst, and pulls it off with something that is constantly entertaining, mostly respectful of its characters and audience, and the truest to the spirit of the franchise. Watching Sonic and Shadow clash with an edge and style that feels even more electric than anything the first two movies even attempted is a blast, and its final battle is especially raw, emotionally cathartic, and well-earned after three good, gradually improving movies and a bad TV show.</p><p>I think “earned” is the word my mind keeps wandering to as I think back on <em>Sonic 3</em>. These movies have come so far from when Paramount first revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">the horrifying gremlin</a></span> that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ugly-sonic-hedgehog-cameo-chip-dale-rescue-rangers-disn-1848955965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ugly-sonic-hedgehog-cameo-chip-dale-rescue-rangers-disn-1848955965">Ugly Sonic</a></span> in the first trailer it has since tried to wipe from the internet. Each movie has gradually tried to introduce more of the weird, earnest shit that has kept Sonic and Shadow in the hearts of millions even as the series has hit snags that would have ended most other big franchises. If you’d told me 20 years ago that a live-action adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>would one day hit the big screen I don’t think I would have believed you. If you’d told me it would be good, I would have believed you even less. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, Heavy has a sister and she eventually falls in love with Soldier! Anyway suddenly, nearly seven years after issue six, Valve has published the seventh installment in the main <em>TF2</em> comic series and finally revealed Spy’s face. </p><p><strong><em>And uh, yeah, minor spoilers below for issue seven. Take this as your last warning.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>After 17 years of playing <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, it’s very odd to finally be looking at Spy without his mask on.

Will we get more <em>TF2 </em>comics in the future? Maybe, but as for the main overarching plot of the franchise (yes, it eventually developed one), it seems done. And that’s nice. Maybe now, with this wrapped, Valve can bring closure to&nbsp;another franchise and its plotlines, too. I’m talking about<em> Half-Life 3</em>. I want to play <em>Half-Life 3</em>.

<p>So when Sony put out the recent "remaster" of <em>Zero Dawn</em>, I was cautiously optimistic. Any sort of non-half-assed PS5 reworking ought to reduce load times, right?</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Machines make it hard to enjoy the view.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>I meant to dip into the world of <em>Zero Dawn</em> only for a few hours, but I ended up playing through the whole game and its expansion, <em>The Frozen Wilds, </em>over the last few weeks. The arrow-based gameplay, complex story, and voice acting were still terrific, and the remastered elements were far more than a simple cash-in. Even little things, like the way the adaptive triggers on the PS5 controllers mimic the tension of a bowstring, felt perfect.</p>
<p>I didn't expect to get sucked back into the game's world for so many hours, but I had a great time doing it and wanted to spread the good word for those who might be looking for an engaging single-player experience over the holidays.</p>
<h2>Big changes</h2>
<p>When it comes to major changes, the remaster has three.</p>
<p>First, the game loads fast. It feels like a ground-up PS5 title. Death—and its attendant reloads—no longer makes me want to throw my controller across the room during difficult battles. It's great.</p>
<p>Second, the game looks unbelievable. This is not a case of just upping the resolution to 4K and calling it a day. Sony claims that the game features "over 10 hours of re-recorded conversation, mocap and countless graphical improvements that bring the game to the same visual fidelity as its critically acclaimed sequel." Also, the game's characters have "been upgraded, bringing them in line with current generation advances in character models and rendering."</p>
<p>This is not just marketing fluff. The faces look incredible, even in close-up cinematic interludes, but what really caught my eye was the lighting. From the moment a young Aloy spelunks into a cave and finds an electronic gadget attached to a skeleton lying peacefully in a sunbeam, the revamped lighting engine makes its presence clear. No, it's not "realistic"—everything looks like a postcard shot. But I found myself pausing the game just to look at the sunlight scattered by a snowstorm or dawn breaking over a mountain range. The lighting interacts with a volumetric set of effects that bring fog and dust devils to life like few other games I've seen. When Aloy tramps through a winter squall, leaving footsteps in the mountain snow as she walks, the effect is magical. (Until a Glinthawk swoops in, screaming, and attacks.)</p>

There are many who deserve praise, but to describe their impact, we must stare the flaws of this demographic dead in the eye.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When industry players sing the praises of UGC platforms they struggle to explain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they're so popular. For the most part Roblox Corporation has soaked up all the attention we'd normally heap on developers. It'd be like if we praised the App Store instead of Ustwo Games for the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There is some difference. Players move more fluidly between games in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ecosystem than they do on other app stores, but that fluidity leaves many developers making great games on the service on the sidelines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Praising this wide group of workers comes with complications. A minority of them are under the age of 18, caught in the Robux ecosystem that sells itself both as "baby's first game project" and "the ultimate way to self-monetize." People Make Games and other reporters have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_gXlauRB1EQ?si=jOsqy7cmLZIJy9W0">documented</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the stress these young folks have been through, and though the company promises ever-improving protections, they are still a part of the system powering its profits. Some might even say they're exploited.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And then we must turn our gaze further up the age range, because many successful developers on these platforms are the ones doing the exploiting. Some take advantage of young folks to underpay them for popular games; others steal their suddenly successful ideas and clone titles, blurring the line between inspiration and theft. And an absolutely vile lot of them are the ones behind the horrendous experiences like "Escape to Epstein Island" and "Diddy Party" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">spotted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Hindenburg research in its blistering report explaining why it is shorting Roblox Corporation.

As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">UEFN, and other platforms enjoyed notable growth in 2024, we'd like to recognize the positive—and where needed, negative—impact these workers made.

It's still set in the capitalist dystopia that is Night City, but in The Time of the Red, the literal nuclear fallout of a terrorist attack that devastated Arasaka Tower. Everyone still needs to deal with corpo scum, cyberpsychos, and brutal cops, but they also need to navigate dangerous storms and suffocating radiation.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> recognized its tabletop foundations. The Bonus Content in the game includes a PDF of the Cyberpunk 2020 Core Rulebook.</p>

<p>This is the second edition of the foundational TTRPG released in 1990. It contains crucial elements of lore such as the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, and is a snapshot of the game's design ethos of the era..</p>
