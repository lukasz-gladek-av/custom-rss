            <p>
Yooka-Laylee, the Banjo-Kazooie-inspired platform collect-'em-up from developer Playtonic Games, is getting a bit of a spruce-up for PC and unspecified consoles by way of a newly announced (and dubiously named) remaster, Yooka-Replaylee.
</p>
<p>
The original Yooka-Laylee launched back in 2017, garnering modest acclaim - Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee">called it</a> a "gentle, irreverent platformer let down by spotty handling and a slight shortage of genius" - and was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review-a-brilliant-and-better-follow-up">far superior side-scrolling sequel</a>, the Donkey Kong Country-inspired Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, two years later.
</p>
<p>
Yooka-Replaylee, though, revisits the colourful if occasionally cumbersome original with an eye to polishing things up for a new generation of players. To that end, Playtonic is implementing an improved camera, revised controls, a world map, a challenges tracker, and more.
</p>

<p>
There's an expansive art and animation overhaul (behold that thick, luscious grass, for instance), higher resolution support and performance enhancements, plus new and remixed challenges, a new collectible currency, fresh secrets, and new accessibility options. Yooka-Laylee's original soundtrack has also had a major makeover, now presented in arranged orchestral form.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Yooka-Replaylee yet, and no word on the consoles it's targeting, but Playtonic is holding a Q&amp;A session "soon", so hopefully we can expect more details then.
</p>

        <p>A 15-minute trailer arrives next week</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is no more. No, EA haven't once again taken Dragon Age 4 back to the drawing board; instead, they've just changed its name. The next entry in their trad-fantasy RPG series is now called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and we'll get a "first look at gameplay" next week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Without wishing to spoil anything, the name "Dreadwolf" refers to one of Dragon Age's antagonists. According to a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/">blog post from Gary McKay</a>, Dragon Age's executive producer, the name change is designed to reflect that "you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience." There are apparently seven companions you'll be bringing together over the course of the game to form the titular Veilguard.
</p>
<p>The now-former name Dreadwolf was announced back in 2022, but Dragon Age 4 has been in development since shortly after the release of Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. The blog post makes reference to this long development history, framing it as "an incredible opportunity".
</p>
<p>"We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us."
</p>
<p>I suppose that, in an industry that regularly death-marches developers to release a multiplayer game they're ill-prepared to produce, then shuts them down when the game is predictably flawed, it is ultimately to EA's credit that the swung back to letting BioWare make a singleplayer game. In this one instance.
</p>
<p>We'll finally get a proper look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard on June 11th at 8am PT/4pm BST when a fifteen minute trailer is released via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage">Dragon Age YouTube channel</a>.</p>

The patch includes various fixes and improvements, along with details about how the Iron Giant will be nerfed when he returns. </p><p>As noted in a new blog post, the <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/1-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiVersus 1.01 patch notes</a> first mention that Iron Gaint is still unplayable after the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-tournament-player-sees-their-main-character-pulled-from-the-game-mid-bracket-wins-anyway">previously pulled the character from the roster</a>. They also note that a status update will be shared sometime next week.</p><p>The Iron Giant was removed from the MultiVersus character roster after complaints that he was overpowered and was causing an unfair advantage. The patch notes mention that this next update should add changes that will "prevent Iron Giant from chaining certain sets of attack infinitely." Two things getting nerfed in Iron Giant's move set are the Ground Side Attack, which will get a "slightly smaller" hitbox, and his Rage Mode Up Special, which will decrease the final hit damage from 5 to 6. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/multiversusofficialgameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll-1657816935298-1717698402681.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>We now have more details on the specifics of how Iron Giant will be nerfed. (Image courtesy of Player First Games)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another noteworthy change coming to Patch 1.01 includes fixing an issue that was causing performance problems for the Xbox Series X/S version and addressing an issue where specific keyboard configurations caused phantom inputs during a match. </p><p>MultiVersus was fully released last May, after an early access and beta versions of the game were held from July 2022 until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-early-access-closing-in-june-full-release-window-confirmed">June 2023</a>. Upon its full release, MultiVersus received <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-relaunch-draws-many-players-and-many-complaints">a ton of compliments,</a> with one player saying the full release felt "more like a beta than the beta." </p><p>Below is the full list of patch notes for MultiVersus patch 1.01. </p><h2><strong>MultiVersus Patch 1.01 Notes</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>General <ul data-cy="list"><li>Lowered Hit Pause on all Hits by 10% in 1v1 modes</li><li>Players can now try all Fighters in Training Mode, including Fighters they do not own</li><li>Battlepass XP will now be granted after each PvP Match in addition to Events and Missions.</li></ul></li><li>Bug Fixes<ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete daily rewards in Rifts Mode</li><li>Fixed an issue that was impacting performance on Xbox Series X|S </li><li>Fixed an issue where beam visual effects were occasionally invisible on PlayStation consoles </li><li>Fixed an issue where certain keyboard configurations would cause phantom inputs in matches </li><li>Fixed an issue with pause input conflicts in Training</li></ul></li><li>Characters<ul data-cy="list"><li>Legend<ul data-cy="list"><li>+ = Buff </li><li>– = Nerf </li><li>~ = Change </li><li>* = Bugfix </li><li>Note: Attacks callouts reference default controls. </li></ul></li><li>Arya<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Dash Attack</strong></em> <ul data-cy="list"><li>(~) Reduced input buffer window for follow-up attacks</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Banana Guard<ul data-cy="list"><li>The goal of this change is to reduce the extreme kill power on Banana Guard’s side specials and bring it more in line with the damage of the rest of the cast. </li><li><em><strong>Aerial Side Special </strong></em><em> </em><ul data-cy="list"><li>(–) Reduced damage to 10 from 12 </li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Ground Side Special</strong></em><em> </em><ul data-cy="list"><li>(–) Reduced damage to 12 from 14 </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Bug Bunny<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Neutral Special</strong></em> </li><li>(*) Fixed an issue causing the Safe to hit repeatedly and rapidly in succession</li></ul></li><li>Garnet<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Down Special</strong></em>  <ul data-cy="list"><li>(*) Fixed an issue where Garnet and an enemy could be frozen at the end of her Star Grab</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Gizmo<ul data-cy="list"><li><em><strong>Up Special</strong></em> <ul data-cy="list"><li>(–) Ally attach cooldown now begins when Gizmo detaches from his ally, instead of beginning when Gizmo attaches to his ally. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Iron Giant<ul data-cy="list"><li>The goal of these changes is to prevent Iron Giant from chaining certain sets of attacks infinitely.

                <p>One of the most highly-requested features from the community since the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">Hogwarts Legacy</a> has been a Photo Mode. The ability to capture unique images of characters, locations, or scenes is an invaluable part of the open-world experience in gaming. While many fans thought the idea of a Photo Mode in Hogwarts Legacy was dead, the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hogwarts-legacy-everything-new-in-the-summer-update/2900-5457/" data-ref-id="2900-5457">summer update</a> changed that.</p><p>The summer update introduced a flurry of content into the game, including the long-awaited Photo Mode. You can now take professional screenshots in-game and share them with the world, but you'll first have to understand how to access and use Photo Mode.</p><h2>Accessing Photo Mode in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><p>Before you can start taking pictures, there's one requirement you need to meet. Photo Mode is only available after you complete the main mission where you unlock the Field Guide. Once that mission is complete, which occurs within the first hour or so of Hogwarts Legacy, you can start using Photo Mode.</p><p>To do that, press "Esc" on keyboard or "Options/Start" on controller. This brings you to the main menu where you can select Gear, Settings, and other menus. However, you don't need to click on any single menu. Instead, look at the bottom-right corner of the screen and find the "Enter Photo Mode" text. Next to that text, there will be a button, which you need to click to enter Photo Mode. For me on keyboard, the default button was "K."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4314218-hogwartslegacyscreenshot2024.06.06-11.28.27.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4314218" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4314218-hogwartslegacyscreenshot2024.06.06-11.28.27.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4314218"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4314218-hogwartslegacyscreenshot2024.06.06-11.28.27.18.png"></figure><p>Once you're in Photo Mode, you have several different options to tinker with. You can adjust the Tilt, Depth of Field, Exposure, Contrast, Saturation, and other image options. You also have the choice to select a specific season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter), add a new filter, and even change the time of day. Changing the time doesn't change the time in-game, though; it only impacts Photo Mode.</p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing Photo Mode option is changing your character's pose. You can choose from several different poses, including Standing, Sitting, Taunting, etc. If you don't want your character in the image at all, you're also able to remove them entirely. There's also the ability to zoom in past your character using either your mouse and keyboard or controller joysticks.</p><p>When you're ready to take a picture, look at the bottom of the screen to find the "Toggle UI" option. Press the button next to Toggle UI to get rid of all the menus and text on the screen. Then, take your pictures(s), press the Toggle UI button, and then hold Esc/Options to return to the main menu of Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>As time goes on, the developers might add new features to Photo Mode, but it's a solid addition already to Hogwarts Legacy.

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em>, developer Bungie is moving the game to a new model that will ditch seasons in favor of Episodes. These are narrative arcs that last longer than seasons and should pack in a lot more story set after the expansion’s conclusion. </p> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em> has had dozens of seasons, each one slowly moving the story forward between expansions. I’ve had my battles with this model because, at times, it felt to me like I couldn’t play anything else if I wanted to make the most of them. With <em>The Final Shape</em> being the last major expansion for the game, Bungie is moving away from seasons and offering players something new and different on a much less pressured time scale. </p>

I have final timing details on the first Episode, and using the six-week schedule, I’ve worked out roughly when the following Episodes and Acts should be released. I’ve outlined this below, alongside what each Episode should be about. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 1: Echoes</em></h3> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 1: Echoes</em> is scheduled for release on <strong>June 11, 2024</strong>. This Episode will focus on the Vex, which likely means it’ll entail some sort of world-ending problem they’re causing by going back or forward in time. The Acts release schedule for this Episode is roughly as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 1 Echoes</em> Act 1</strong> – June 11, 2024 to July 23, 2024</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 1 Echoes</em> Act 2</strong> – July 23, 2024 to September 3, 2024</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 1 Echoes</em> Act 3</strong> – September 3, 2024 to October 15, 2024</li> </ul>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 2: Revenant</em></h3> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 2: Revenant</em> is a Scorn-based Episode. This faction is one of the most annoying to fight in the game but also incredibly interesting because they’re effectively mutated Fallen zombies. It’ll be interesting to see what they’re up to when this Episode rolls around. The rough timings for the Episode are as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 2 Revenant</em> Act 1</strong> – October 15, 2024 to November 26, 2024</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 2 Revenant</em> Act 2</strong> – November 26, 2024 to January 7, 2025</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 2 Revenant</em> Act 3</strong> – January 7, 2025 to February 18, 2025</li> </ul>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2 Episode 3: Heresy</em></h3> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">To end the run of Episodes, we have <em>Destiny 2 Episode 3: Heresy</em>. This one will look at the Hive, though I have no idea which ones in particular. We’ve battled with the Hive pretty consistently since the original <em>Destiny</em> and have killed off or seriously injured most of their leaders. It’s hard to imagine what might pop up next. The rough timings for this Episode are outlined below. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 3 Heresy</em> Act 1</strong> – February 18, 2025 to April 1, 2025</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 3 Heresy</em> Act 2</strong> – April 1, 2025 to May 13, 2025</li> <li><strong><em>Destiny 2</em> <em>Episode 3 Heresy</em> Act 3</strong> – May 13, 2025 to June 24, 2025</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">This would take us up to just over a year after the release of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. However, the original timeline was just shy of a year, so I’d expect a few of these end and launch weeks to coincide or shift back to fall in line with the original plan. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What are Episodes in <em>Destiny 2</em>?</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-eliksni-playing-guitar.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Episodes are massive chunks of new content for <em>Destiny 2</em>. While seasons often added a new story you could play a part of each week, Dungeons, new activities, and new weapons, Episodes go further. They still have all the same content a season would add, but now more is added every six weeks. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">For example, the Echoes Episode begins with Act 1, then it’ll get Act 2 six weeks later, and Act 3 after another six weeks. Each Act adds new activities, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Exotics</a>, more story, and even more season pass ranks to climb through. They layer on top of each other until the Episode ends after three months, and the next one starts.</p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">My hope for this system is that it does away with the frantic need to play through everything in a season as fast as possible as soon as it drops. Instead, each Episode can feel like the smaller expansions of the past, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2-warmind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warmind</a></em>. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-guerrilla-collective-2024-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-guerrilla-collective-2024-announcement.891900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-guerrilla-collective-2024-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we hit the summer video game announcement season, we're kicking June off with a collection of indie devs in the Guerilla Collective event today. This is the fifth year that Guerilla Collective has hosted an event, and it generally showcases interesting games from a wide variety of developers that may not get attention at other showcases. If you want to see what your next favorite indie game may be, this is the spot to be, as we have all the announcements made.</p>

<h3>Wrekless - Free Range Games</h3>
<p>After a few minutes of opening, the Guerrilla Collective kicked off with an announcement of skateboarding mmo, <em>Wrekless</em>. The trailer for it emphasized the ability to build, share, and play together in this arcade skateboarding game. Featuring developers who worked on <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em>, this is another team attempting to bring the skating genre back, and into the multiplayer era of self-expression and shared regions.</p>

<p><em>Wrekless </em>is set for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931930/Wrekless/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wrekless">early access in Q3 2024 on Steam</a>.</p>
<h3>Yooka-Replaylee - Playtonic</h3>
<p><em>Yookla-Laylee</em> was one of the games that helped kick off the whole kickstarter spiritual successor thing, and while the game released to mixed reviews, it got a more acclaimed follow-up, and now the team at Playtonic is going back to their first game to improve it. As the definitive version of the game, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> will feature improved cameras and controls (including a tweaked move set), which will hopefully help many player's issues with the game, improved visuals, an orchestral soundtrack, and both new and improved challenges. There will also be a new collectible currency, a new world map and challenge tracker, and all new tonics, and mechandise at Vendi.</p>

<p><em>Yooka-Replayee</em> is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448020/YookaReplaylee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Yooka Replayee">wishlist on Steam</a> now, and will have a developer QnA next week.</p>
<h3>Deathbound - Trialforge Studio</h3>
<p>Another studio is trying their hands at the souls-like genre, with Trialforge's <em>Deathbound</em> having a unique party-based mechanic where you switch characters at the tap of a button. It had a passable demo back in Steam Next Fest, but left myself and others wondering how it would turn out. Well, they are releasing a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277130/Deathbound/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Deathbound">new <em>Deathbound</em> demo</a> so everyone can see what progress has come with the game, and if it interests them before the game releases later this year.</p>


<h3>Volgarr The Viking 2 - Crazy Viking Studios</h3>
<p>Following <em>Deathbound </em>is a return of a hard-as-hell action game, <em>Volgarr the Viking</em>, that takes its inspiration from 80s arcade action games with a sequel. While retaining its difficulty, <em>Volgarr the Viking 2</em> adds in modern conveniences like a practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and unlimited continues - though there is a bonus for purists who disdain these features as well.</p>

<p><em>Volgarr the Viking 2</em> will release August 26th, 2024 for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<h3>Knights in Tight Spaces - Ground Shatter</h3>

<p><em>Knights in Tight Spaces</em> has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Knights in Tight Places">demo available now on Steam</a>.</p>

More classes, and abilities are seen here, while retaining the core tactical focus of <em>Steamworld Heist</em>, including elements such as the richocheting bullets. We saw some submarine travel, and the equipment of a torpedo to use against your foes.</p>

<p><em>Steamworld Heist 2</em> releases August 8th</p>
<h3>Kiborg - Sobaka Studio</h3>
<p>Developer Sobaka Studio showcased their upcoming action rogue-lite <em>Kiborg</em> during the show, with a brand new trailer, and a new announcement: there will be a free prologue releasing this summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. <em>Kiborg: Arena</em> has you playing as protagonist Morgan Lee's clones fighting in Sigma's Coliseum, against other prisoners to raise cash to fund the resistance group he leads.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/l5r-river-of-gold-coming-to-retail-in-august<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For certain dedicated tabletop fans, Legend of the Five Rings is special. It began as a living card game published by Fantasy Flight Games, then spun off into a TTRPG. It even has a <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> conversion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adventures-in-rokugan-brings-l5r-to-dd-5e"><em>Adventures in Rokugan</em></a>. Now, players can make their fortune when a new board game, L5R River of Gold, comes to retail.</p>
<h2>The <em>L5R River of Gold</em> retail announcement</h2>
<p>The retail announcement of <em>L5R River of Gold</em> was covered by <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/57068/l5r-river-gold-board-game-heads-retail" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ICV2</a>. In the game, players travel through the East Asian-inspired fantasy world of Rokugan as a merchant on the titular golden river, delivering goods for their clan. In addition, they will invest in trade ports, markets, and shrines, and gain influence with manor houses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/l5r-river-of-gold-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8Jxepd-k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/l5r-river-of-gold-card-artwork.jpg?itok=mU_r4HDx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is it wise to trust a contract from the Scorpion Clan?</figcaption></figure><p>The goal is to build wealth and best the merchants from the rival clans. Doing this will require resource management and strategy as opposed to intense duels. This is notable since <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> is a setting driven by warring samurai clans, duels of passion, and supernatural demon attacks.</p>
<p><em>L5R River of Gold</em> was developed by Keith Piggott, the same creator behind <em>Drawn To Adventure</em> and <em>The Great Barrier Reef Card Game</em>. It will be published by Office Dog, a company launched in May 2022 under <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">Asmodee Group</a>,</p>
<p>This board game will be the first new tabletop experience released in the L5R setting in years. The foundational living card game received its last major expansions in May 2021. The TTRPG, currently on its fifth edition, is being supported by another Asmodee-owned company, Edge Studio.</p>
<p><em>L5R River of Gold</em> is for two to four players ages 14 and up. A single game can be completed in 90 minutes. It will be available at retail stores and hobby shops August 2 and will be sold at an MSRP of $49.99. Each copy will include the Patrons mini-expansion, which will improve replayability.</p>

            <p>It's a new month, which means Microsoft have detailed a new batch of games arriving on Game Pass. Not all of the games themselves are new, mind you: they include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, the HD-2D RPG released in 2018, and its sequel. 
</p><!--more--><p>

Here's the complete list coming in the first half of June 2024:

</p><ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler - Available now</li>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 - Available now</li>
<li>Depersonalization – June 12th</li>
<li>Isonzo – June 13th</li>
<li>The Callisto Protocol - June 13th</li>
<li>Still Wakes The Deep – June 18th</li>
</ul>
<p>The original Octopath Traveler came to Game Pass back in 2021 and left in March last year, and it returns now to coincide with its release on PS4 and PS5. Octopath Traveler 2 is a first-time addition to the subscription service. Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the sequel</a> when it released last year and found it extremely similar, and similarly flawed, to the original:
</p>
<blockquote>Despite knowing this moment is almost certainly in my future, and despite the slightly incredulous realisation that I’ll have spent another 80 hours playing almost exactly the same game I did four years ago, I've still had a good time with Octopath Traveler 2. There’s something innately enthralling about it, and while, deep down, there's still lots of things I dislike about it, cor, those battles are just the absolute business. It remains one of the most captivating combat systems in the entire JRPG genre, and it really does feel good to be back in its gorgeous HD-2D world again, reheated story leftovers and all (and I swear I’m not just saying that because we get another stonking Nishiki score to admire in the process, honest).</blockquote>
<p>Among the other new joiners, the most interesting to me is the launch day arrival of Still Wakes The Deep on June 18th. It's the new game from The Chinese Room, thems what made Everybody's Gone To The Rapture, and thems what are making Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. They're a very different studio from their indie days and I'm curious what they'll produce.
</p>
<p>As always, new joiners mean a similarly sized batch of leavers. The games departing Game Pass on June 15th are Bramble: The Mountain King, High On Life, Rune Factory 4 Special, Spacelines From The Far Out, and The Bookwalker.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-1-remaster-rumored-possibly-multiplatform-fable-gears-others-not-ps5-bound-yet.891891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-rumor-multiplatform-fable-gears-xbox-exclusive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft will be presenting their big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> this weekend, and there’s plenty of speculation about what might be next for Team Green. Will more games make their way to rival hardware after games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-april-release-date-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> went multiplatform earlier this year? And what’s going on troubled tentpole franchises like Halo?</p>
<p>Well, reliable Microsoft insider Tom Warren (<a href="https://subs.theverge.com/checkout?plan=108640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for his newsletter here</a>) has stepped up before the Microsoft’s big show to provide some details about what he’s heard is going on with Team Green. In addition to the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct</a>, Warren is expecting two big first-party reveals – <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-playstation-xbox-core-franchises-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Gears game</a>. Per Warren, Doom will be full multiplatform and Gears will not.</p>
<p>In his article, Warren runs down some of the games he’s heard are being considered for “Project Latitude” (Microsoft’s initiative to bring first-party games to other platforms) – in addition to Doom: The Dark Ages, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a>, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a> are under consideration. Games that are apparently <em>not </em>under consideration are the next Gears, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/south-of-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>Where things get particularly juicy is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halo</a>. According to Warren, a remaster of the original Halo: Combat Evolved is in the works and it<em> is</em> being considered for a multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Of course, take all of this with a grain of salt for now, but Warren has proven he has the goods in the past. As you can perhaps tell, it seems like a lot of things are up in the air at Team Green – while games like Fable and Gears aren't being considered for multiplatform releases now, if Halo can jump, anything can I reckon.</p>

<p id="pJcmZh">These trimmed-down PS5s are equipped with the very same hardware as the older models that will eventually be phased out, but they have a smaller footprint overall and are around two pounds lighter, depending on whether the disc drive is attached. Both consoles are aesthetically similar to the original design, but both feature a small black channel that cuts through both sides.</p>

An ode to some of your favorite games, from <em>Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Slime Rancher</em>, to timeless classics such as <em>Harvest Moon</em>, <em><a title="Series > Story of Seasons [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/story-of-seasons">Story of Seasons</a></em>, <em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > GRANDIA" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grandia">GRANDIA</a></em>, <em>Jade Cocoon</em>, and <em>Azure Dream</em>!</p><p>After moving to take care of a farmstead in a quaint little hamlet called Clover Town, you’re introduced to something that changes your life forever: Blobs! Blobs are cute, wobbly, and rotund creatures which hatch from eggs. Treat them with care and they can become your greatest companions! Coming in dozens of varieties (with all of them being cross-breedable!), Blobs can face off against rival blob trainers and help you out around the farm with their unique abilities.</p><p>As your relationship with the locals (some of whom you might choose to settle down with!) and town increases, the secrets of Clover Town start to unlock in front of you. And by secrets, we mean hidden temples, dungeons, and portals to exotic dimensions! These new worlds contain strange items and priceless artifacts that hold the key to the town’s—and your own—future.

In the world of <em>Ova Magica</em>, people live side by side with these cute creatures, and you can raise them to be strong, loyal friends and sidekicks! To make your blobs stronger, you must feed them well, pet them and use specific skills in battles.</li><li>Your blobs can also help you with your farm work. As your blobs become stronger and more skilled, you can ask them to perform certain scheduled tasks for you to increase your productivity! For example, you can ask the turtle blob to take care of a section of your farm to water it every day. But be careful! Don’t overwork them or take advantage of them… and if they get hungry, they won’t work!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Farming</strong> – You can grow everything from normal crops, berry bushes, and fruit trees, to heart fruit, weird herbs, and mushrooms from other dimensions!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-builds-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail.891861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-builds-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-builds-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="167" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Honkai: Star Rail’s </em>certified intergalactic cowboy, Boothill, has finally made his debut, and he comes with a unique kit strikingly different from standard DPS. </p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking to build up the Galaxy Ranger, here’s everything you need to know about Boothill, including some of the best Relic sets and team compositions for <em>Honkai : Star Rail’s</em> new DPS. </p> <h2 id="h-strongest-boothill-build-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Strongest Boothill Build in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Boothill is a <strong>Physical Hunt </strong>character whose main role is to dish out as much damage as he possibly can. He is the very definition of a ‘Hypercarry’ and investment into him turns him into one of the strongest single-target DPS characters in the game. However, what makes him stand out from his carry brethren is his focus on <strong>Break Damage</strong>, to dish out the pain.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">Boothill is <em>Honkai: Star Rail’s </em>first duelist character, which functions like a Taunt when he uses his Skill on a target. This <strong>Standoff </strong>state forces the target to only attack him, and he gains several bonuses against said target. When an enemy dies to him or has their Break Bar depleted during a Standoff, Boothill gains access to an Empowered Basic attack called <strong>Pocket Trickshot</strong> that deals increased Break damage, and bonus damage to broken targets. To close out his kit, his Ultimate and Technique apply <strong>Physical Weakness </strong>on the select target meaning Boothill is a universal carry and <strong>can face any enemy in the game</strong> without issue.</p>
 <p data-characters="643" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">Despite Boothill being a Hunt carry type of character, he uniquely does not care much for CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG. He is almost entirely focused on Break Effect and relies on Physical Breaks for most of his DPS. Thanks to his Trace, <strong>Ghost Load</strong>, he gains CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG just by stacking up his Break Effect, meaning he’s significantly easier to build than every other carry in the game. How much Break Effect does Boothill need? Well, as much as you can get. Even though his Ghost Load trace does cap out, Break Effect generally does not. With that understanding, let’s talk about how to build up this gunslinger’s gear.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-relics-for-boothill" data-injectable="false">Best Relics for Boothill</h3> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Boothill wants as much Break Effect as he can get, so his best Relic set is the <strong>Thief of Shooting Meteor. </strong>Both of its effects provide a significant increase to his Break Effect, making it the self-explanatory choice. You can farm out this set by running <strong>Cavern of Corrsion: Path of Jabbing Punch.</strong></p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">For his Sphere and Robe set, I highly recommend you run <strong>Talia: Kingdom of Banditry</strong>, as it provides yet another significant boost to his Break Effect stat, provided you can reach the required <strong>145 SPD</strong> to activate its secondary effects. You’ll need to farm the Simulated Universe to obtain this set, specifically<strong> World 4</strong>.</p>
 <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Boothill-Best-Build-Relics.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">Remember that Boothill needs all the Break Effect you can give him, so aim for substats with Break Effect as well. CRIT and CRIT DMG are not terrible on him, but far from ideal. ATK% is a moderately good choice of stat to get for him as well. Finally, as with any Hypercarry in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, you want to make sure you stack a ton of Speed so that he gets multiple turns per turn cycle.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-team-comp-boothill" data-injectable="false">Best Team Comp Boothill</h3> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">Boothill thrives off additional turns and characters that buff Breaks since he should be treated as the sole carry on his team. His greatest weakness is his focus on single target, which means you want to give him as many turns to act as possible to make up for this. With that in mind, his most favored teammates are characters that, naturally, support these two requirements of his. Ruan Mei, Bronya, and Gallagher are his best allies.</p>
 <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><strong>Ruan Mei </strong>is the ideal Break Harmony support for Boothill, as she helps him shred enemy Break Bars faster, and provides him increased up-time on enemies that are already broken. She also deals significant damage of her own, if built well, to enemies that are broken, which pairs exceptionally well with Boothill’s insane damage output. Finally, Ruan Mei flat out provides a massive damage buff through her Skill that remains helpful for Boothill as it does for any other carry.</p>

Bronya also provides a DMG Buff when she utilizes her Skill on Boothill, which helps a bit with his damage.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><strong>Gallagher </strong>is his ideal Abundance support of choice because he contributes a significant amount of Break damage to assist Boothill in shattering Break bars. He also has a debuff that amplifies the Break damage an enemy is dealt, further favoring Boothill.</p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">You can also run <strong>Harmony Trailblazer</strong>, in place of Bronya for the Super Break effect that is unique to them. However, you will be missing out on extra turns from Bronya, which I don’t think is worth the loss.</p>
 <h2 id="h-should-you-get-boothill-s-lightcone-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Should you get Boothill’s Lightcone in <em>Honkai: Star Rail?</em></h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Boothill-Best-Build-Lightcone.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">If you are planning on pulling Boothill, then I do recommend you pull his Lightcone, <strong>Sailing Towards a Second Life</strong>, as well. The difference between his signature Lightcone and the second-best option is honestly massive, and I cannot imagine making good use of Boothill without it. It provides Boothill with the colossal damage output he needs to do his job as a Hypercarry, and if you don’t get it, you’re better off focusing on other characters for the role. It is what it is.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-eidolons-for-boothill-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Best Eidolons for Boothill in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Boothill is a complete character at E0 as long as you have his Lightcone. However, if you’re interested in pulling some of his Eidolons to make him stronger, here’s an overview of them for your reference. E2 is the best stopping point if you’re planning on pulling.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Boothill-Best-Build-Eidolons.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Dust Trail’s Lone Star (E1)&nbsp;</strong>– When a battle starts, Boothill gains one stack of Pocket Trickshot. When he deals damage to an enemy, he ignores 16% of the enemy’s Defense. This is a rather strong E1, as it gives him a significant boost to his upfront Break and normal damage at the start of a fight. The faster Boothill can Break, the stronger he will be. Good Eidolon.</li> <li><strong>Milestonemonger (E2) </strong>– When in Standoff and gaining Pocket Trickshot, Boothill restores one Skill Point and increases his Break Effect by 30%. This effect lasts for two turns in total. This Eidolon is a massive increase to his overall performance (Break and Damage), as he gains an entire Relic’s worth of Break Damage. Oh, and here’s a free Skill Point back for that Skill you used. Insane. A good stopping point for Eidolons.</li> <li><strong>Marble Orchard’s Guard (E3) </strong>– Damage boost to Ultimate and Basic Attack. Boothill’s Ultimate hits like a tank shell and increased scaling on it is not a bad thing. Not required, however.</li> <li><strong>Cold Cuts Chef (E4) </strong>– Enemies caught in a Standoff with Boothill receive 12% increased damage. Boothill offsets 12% of damage taken from enemies in his Standoff. This is a decent strong Eidolon as it allows Boothill to amplify the damage a target takes from all sources. However, since Boothill favors being the lone carry on his team, it isn’t all that useful for team support. He, however, still gains the benefit, making it a solid E4.</li> <li><strong>Stump Speech (E5) </strong>– Damage boost to Skill and Talent. Considering that Boothill’s Skill and Talent is where a majority of his damage (outside of Break) comes from, this is a very strong Eidolon to have for him.</li> <li><strong>Crowbar Hotel’s Racoon (E6) </strong>– Basically, this makes the Break Damage caused by Boothill’s Talent deal an astronomical amount of additional damage beyond the standard effect. Literally broken. </li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clank-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Clank! is a deck-building adventure that's very much worth your consideration. The game is for 2-4 players, and while the recommendations say that it takes 30-60 minutes to complete, matches go about double that or more, especially with more players. So sit down and get ready, because it’s time to deck-build your way out of a dungeon before the monsters get you.</p><p>Clank!, made by Dire Wolf Digital and Renegade Game Studios, is a competitive game that integrates a base <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> with cards and tokens. Movement is pushed forward with cards gained in the deck-building portion of the game. As with any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building game</a>, you’ll start with a small collection of cards to start, but advancement will require more cards to be added through your turns. </p><p>You’ll take turns moving and exploring dungeon depths, collecting cards and artifacts, gaining mastery, and evading a boss, which in your starter game is, of course, everyone’s favorite medieval adversary: the dragon. Go through the dungeon's depths with rewards and you will score well. But wait, it’s not so simple.</p><p>When all players are knocked out of the dungeon (unless playing in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, where the first player to do this will make the game end), successfully exits on their own or with the help of townspeople (a few spaces on the game board above the depths of the dungeon), they will add up their accumulated scores. Scores are added on acquired treasures (artifacts and other tokens gained along your journey through the dungeon), the value of gold tokens, and cards with a green amount visible in the top right-hand corner. The amount on the cards includes everything you’ve had in your collected journey- not just the ones in your hand.</p><p>The game also has an optional companion app (available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.direwolfdigital.Renegade&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Android</u></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/renegade-games-companion/id1046548265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Apple</u></a> users) that can be integrated into play. With the app, you’ll add a further dimension to the experience. You can also play it as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> if you want to go deep alone. </p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Clank! A Deck-building Adventure</h3><div><div id="164688"><p><h3>Clank!</h3></p></div><div id="164694"><p><h3>Clank! Legacy: Acquisitions Incorporated</h3></p></div></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Two-sided game board, 180+ cards, 80+ tokens, 30 cubes, 4 player meeples in different colors, 24 dragon cubes, cloth dragon bag, dragon monster meeple</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65.00 USD2</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 Players (best with 3)</li><li>20-30 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>The original base game of assorted dungeon hijinx is needed to start your adventure through what may be a series of dungeon exploits. It will guide your adventure through a simple dungeon with obstacles, even at the base game. Future expansions and packs can be added to the game to enhance the difficulty and boss monsters that seek to end your trek to defeat.</p><h2>Expansions</h2><p>Clank! has two types of expansions. The original expansions follow a similar medieval approach to the base game. They add obstacles and other medieval and fantasy-type bosses. The other expansion type goes a different route, which is more geared toward players with a deeper understanding of the game. Those expansions are broken up into space-themed dungeons and legacy playing. Space-themed editions have an expanded board and have space as their fantasy direction. Legacy editions of games are intensive versions which incorporate multiple versions of the game. They will involve numerous playthroughs to complete. As a standard, you won’t finish a legacy game version of really any game on one game night, regardless of which game it is. That’s no different with Clank!’s versions. You’ll have to sit through multiple nights of dungeon-crawling gaming for those. </p><h3>Standard Fantasy Style Expansions</h3><h3>Sunken Treasures</h3><div id="201702"><p><h3>Clank! Sunken Treasures</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Two new maps, a marketplace board, more dungeon cards, Treasure rooms added to the board, room challenges from environments, and card effects brought on by discarding cards. Two-sided game board, 36 cards, market board, 5 tokens</p><p><strong>(Base Game Required)</strong></p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players</li><li>20-30 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>This first expansion adds new sunken depths to your dungeon experience. The addition of water and environmental elements can force players to incorporate new strategies involving timing and skill. Will you sink to the bottom in defeat or will you tread water and escape to the surface unscathed?</p><h3>The Mummy's Curse</h3><div id="201703"><p><h3>Clank! The Mummy's Curse</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Mummy monster in addition to the dragon, a mummy curse die, additional cards and rewards tokens, artifact changes. Two-sided game board, 41 cards, 31 tokens, market board, dragon meeple, mummy meeple, pyramid die</p><p><strong>(Base Game Required)</strong></p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 12+</li></ul><p>Think a dragon was a tough enough adversary for your dungeon crawl? The addition of the mummy monster will add further challenges to the dungeon. It works with curses that change the dynamic, causing havoc and frustrating the dragon. As mentioned in the contents portion, the Mummy's Curse also changes the route to acquiring artifacts in the game. The artifact changes made in this second edition of the game where a player can use an action to gain an artifact in the room (the first two editions didn’t allow for that), become a mainstay approach for all subsequent game versions.</p><h3>Expeditions: Gold and Silk</h3><div id="201704"><p><h3>Clank! Expeditions: Gold and Silk</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Double-sided game board, 8-point artifact, 3 mining bonus tokens, market board, 4 player meeples, 12 web tokens, 3 mining bonus tokens, spider meeple character monster </p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $25.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 12+</li></ul><p>Two additional boards with a gold mine are key to this treacherous Gold &amp; Silk expansion dungeon. A spider opponent adds danger as you explore gold mines filled with gold veins and treasures. Webbed rooms create further danger. Successfully navigating the mine may result in additional treasures hidden in a section the spider has placed in its secret lair. Will you get through the spun silk before the spider gets you? </p><h3>Temple of the Ape Lords</h3><div id="201705"><p><h3>Clank! Expeditions - Temple of the Ape Lords</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 1 two-sided game board, 1 Ape boss meeple, 4 player meeples</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $25.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-4 Players</li><li>30-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>This version of the game adds several elements which may make players go bananas. It integrates apes into the dungeon, bringing a barrel full of assorted shenanigans. Movement on the board can be rotated in some spaces. This version also allows for a mini-campaign mode for playing two different versions of the game- each on their side</p><h3>Clank Adventuring Party</h3><div id="201706"><p><h3>Clank! Adventuring Party</h3></p></div><p><strong>Contents</strong>: side board used for 5-6 players, 30 cubes in 2 additional colors, 6 player meeples, 6 character boards, 127 cards (including 6 starter decks each with 10 cards), 90+ tokens, Hexavultus boss meeple, rules</p><p>(The base game is required, but this expansion is also compatible with Clank! Legacy.)</p><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2-6 Players</li><li>60-120 minutes</li><li>Ages 13+</li></ul><p>In Clank! Adventuring Party, you’ll gain six new adventures to choose from to guide you through the dungeon. Each adventurer in this edition will wield its own connected powers. Most are typical magic and fantasy types characters such as the dwarf, orc, elf, and mage. However, there are also a couple of animals too. You can play as a robot monkey or a cute kitten with some bite to it. This version also adds a new villain: Hexavultus. Which party will you choose to go into the depths this time? Choose wisely.</p><h2>More Expansions &amp; Add Ons</h2><p>There are multiple versions of space-type expansions in the series. The game operates a bit differently with a changeable spaceship-type board. There are three space versions of the game available. Clank in Space is the first in the series. Others in the space edition of expansions are <a href="https://zdcs.link/W0qy6" target="_blank"><u>Clank in Space: Apocalypse</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdwy5" target="_blank"><u>Clank in Space: Cyber Station 11</u></a>.</p><p>A legacy version of the game based on a comic and podcast was created. That version is called <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV3yJ" target="_blank"><u>Clank! Legacy Acquisitions Incorporated</u></a>. </p><p>There are also character Packs (to be used in the legacy after they’ve completed the legacy version of the game: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRBbv" target="_blank"><u>Upper Management Pack</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVnyN" target="_blank"><u>The C Team Pack</u></a>.</p><p>Several promo cards can be added to the game. <br>
<strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>With a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808/clank-a-deck-building-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>7.8 rating on Board Game Geek</u></a> and multiple dungeons to unlock, Clank! is a solid choice for your gaming adventures. The base game is tons of fun to play on its own accord, but each expansion adds an assortment of new adventures. My main complaint is that, sadly, despite the irony of the game being made by a company with “digital” in their name, Clank! isn’t available to play digitally. Their side companion app is a great addition to things, but I wish there were more ways to play. Clank! And its expansions are massive games with tons of pieces. Older kids will love this, but families, especially those with younger kids in the house, will dread when pieces go missing. Moving past those two items, the game is a highly enjoyable adventure in fantasy dungeons with enough challenges to keep folks entertained for a long time.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duckside-hands-on-preview-dayz-and-rust-inspired-open-world-survivalbut-youre-a-duck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Survival games like DayZ or Rust remain hard to beat, but Duckside presents an interesting challenger. Developed by tinyBuild Riga in Unreal Engine 5 with producers from Hello Neighbor, Duckside is a new persistent open-world survival game where ducks have become combat-trained. Taking the fight to both humans and fellow mallards, I recently went hands-on with the beta. So far, it's a quacking good time.</p><p>I respect that Duckside doesn't justify its unusual premise. There are currently no flimsy narratives or ridiculous origin stories explaining why ducks can suddenly wield weapons or craft tools. All we know is that they've become tired of being hunted and began fighting for freedom. Unfortunately, these new birds of prey can't shake those territorial instincts between each other. This island has become a fierce battleground, offering 50-person servers and PvE against human NPCs across a day and night cycle.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Duckside - IGN Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Using ducks over humans provides unique perks, and the flight mechanics feel great. Some issues with draw distance are noticeable, though tinyBuild confirmed this will be addressed as development progresses. Regardless, taking to the skies feels like a breeze. The stamina system ensures you can't reach unreasonable heights. Landings are usually smooth, yet even fliers can take fall damage, so this requires some precision. Sure, flying makes you an easier target and you could take evasive action. Getting the drop on enemies is considerably more fun, and shooting others when flying is surprisingly entertaining.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shooting others when flying is surprisingly entertaining.</p></div><p>Arming yourself should be your first priority since leaving the nest unprepared can have dire consequences. Crude options like a crossbow work in a pinch, though ducks have arguably never been more terrifying than seeing one with a sawed-off shotgun. Shelter is another essential consideration when everyone wants to kill you, and location is just as crucial as building quality. While flying across the map is both quick and convenient, being on the island's fringes isn't ideal but neither is making yourself an easy target. Crafting a nest secures a respawn point within your base.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Basic materials are fittingly obtained by pecking objects like trees or rocks alongside abandoned storage cans. I enjoyed how Duckside incentivises moderation as over mining a tree can cause it to collapse, alert other ducks of your presence. Item blueprints can also teach you new recipes for item crafting, but researching new items comes at a cost, so you must use your resources wisely. Key items can be obtained by raiding human outposts like the port area or an abandoned swimming pool, a risky proposition that feels suitably rewarding when you succeed. If you get complacent, well. As the old saying goes, duck around and find out. Since intruders could storm your base at any point, keeping these materials hidden is essential for long-term survival. I learned the hard way that death empties your inventory. </p><p>Of course, you can't stay hidden forever like a lonely duckling. Fortune favors the bold, and I appreciate how Duckside stops you from becoming too comfortable. Alongside a hunger meter, bases eventually deteriorate, though they can be upgraded for increased longevity. Using a persistent server means anything you have could be gone when you next return. Some might scream fowl play, though it's a welcome challenge. Getting too greedy could turn you into someone else's golden goose, so put those materials to good use while you have them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Duckside - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>One of Duckside's more enjoyable server-wide objectives involves the shrine. You can initiate a sacrifice using white feathers collected by killing other ducks or by offering hunters licenses obtained from humans. That creates a parachute airdrop filled with supplies that everyone can see across the map to effectively encourage a risk vs. reward situation, though I never saw this directly.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Basic materials are fittingly obtained by pecking objects like trees or rocks alongside abandoned storage cans.</p></div><p>You could go it alone but Duckside's a game best experienced with others. Squadding up and working towards a loosely defined common goal, likely involving resource gathering and raiding someone's base, is highly entertaining. My session with the developers ended on an explosive notepad and despite a successful base infiltration, my celebration was brief. To my amusement and despair, I completely forgot about nests allowing respawns and immediately paid the price. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Alone, that likely would've been frustrating. As a team effort, it was hilarious and tinyBuild's take on open-world survival has teeth. Even though it's an early bird, Duckside shows considerable potential and I'm keen to see how this premise expands.

<p data-characters="328" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I was watching the Guerilla Collective Stream today when <em>W.I.L.D. Tactics’</em> trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/V6-rr6Lfbfw?si=s_yCj1Iw6fczRXRj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the air</a>. It seemed familiar. I was certain I hadn’t seen it before and didn’t recognize the art style, but there was something familiar. Then the Wild Gentlemen logo flashed on screen, and I knew. This is a <em>Chicken Police </em>spin-off.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="WILD Tactics | Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6-rr6Lfbfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true"><em>Chicken Police</em> is something that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/indie-spotlight-chicken-police/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I always hover around</a>. I named the next mainline game in the series, <em>Chicken Police: Into the Hive</em> my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoids-most-anticipated-games-of-2024/">most anticipated game of 2024</a>. What draws me to these games is the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/zipps-cafe-is-a-short-form-prologue-game-with-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obvious passion behind their world-building</a>. It doesn’t necessarily matter what form the games take, but that storytelling is just delectable. I’d make a finger-lickin’ reference there, but I’ve done that enough in other articles.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">While the trailer for <em>W.I.L.D. Tactics</em> is entirely a flashy animated teaser with no gameplay, screenshots and information have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384640/WILD_Tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived elsewhere</a>. It’s a turn-based strategy game made in the vein of <em>XCOM</em> but with the series’ noir stylings and anthropomorphic characters. It promises 15 story-focused missions that range from stealth to all-out assault, and 12 characters to carry them out.</p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">While press material pushes the “story-focused” angle, there is squad and base management, upgrades, and a social system between the characters to keep things dynamic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">They had me at “World of Wilderness.”</p> <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false"><em>W.I.L.D. Tactics </em>currently doesn’t have a release window, but will be coming to PC. Other platforms will be announced later.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a successful open beta earlier this year, TinyBuild has announced that a second open beta for <em>Duckside</em> is now live. More than 150,000 players jumped into the first beta and the developer is expecting many more to take up the call to arms now.</p> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><em>Duckside</em> is a PvP, PvE base building and crafting title set in a persistent open world where players can form groups, create a base of operations, and then head out on missions to raid others, attack marked locations on the map, and cause all kinds of Mallard mayhem. The game is a lot like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a></em>, with regular server wipes to keep things interesting and help avoid any single group becoming overpowered or allowing players to collect and hoard everything on the map. </p>
 <h2 id="h-duckside-s-second-open-beta-brings-meaningful-changes-and-a-fun-new-hat" data-injectable="false"><em>Duckside</em>‘s second open beta brings meaningful changes and a fun new hat</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="DUCKSIDE Demo Trailer | Play Now | Rust-like survival with PVP and Base Building but you're a DUCK!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbaNL8rvkMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">The second open beta for <em>Duckside</em> will be live from <strong>June 6, 2024, until around June 17, 2024</strong>, though it could go on for longer, depending on how many players try it out. TinyBuid has implemented a slew of new features to keep this beta interesting, even for those who played hours of the first one. </p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">For example, two new defensive structures have been added, both of which should be on every player’s radar for raiding. These are the ship port and the missile silo, both of which will require you to tackle a group of humans to enter. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">You can take advantage of new explosive ammo that will make short work of your enemies, build stronger bases with roof hatches for quick escapes, locate mysterious duck-shaped obelisks for in-game buffs, and try out the PvP or PvE-focused servers if you want worlds with or without fellow players. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Note that you’ll need to build quickly if you want to see everything the game has to offer with regular server wipes every Mondy and Thursday. By using the command “/GetHatForBeta” in-game, you can get yourself a Rubber Ducky Hat free of charge every time you log in, so there’s no need to stash it. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="false">In <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></em>, players must gather resources and build bases so they can eke out an existence in a world filled with other potentially hostile ducks. It’s up to you whether you band together with others to create a utopian society or become a warring group that destroys any signs of life. I love the communities that band together in <em>Rust</em> and can’t wait to see what sort of societies emerge after a few weeks in <em>Duckside</em>‘s servers. </p>

<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-clorinde-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clor</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-clorinde-builds-in-genshin-impact/">inde</a> is a 5-star <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-clorinde-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electro DPS</a> in <em>Genshin Impact</em> who synergizes well with Dendro teammates. Here are the best teams for Clorinde focusing on two of her best reactions: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggravate and Hyperbloom</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-teams-for-quicken-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Teams for Quicken Clorinde</h2> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Aggravate is the easiest reaction for Clorinde to trigger consistently. All you need is an off-field Dendro teammate to apply the occasional hit of Dendro. Clorinde’s best Dendro teammates are <strong>Nahida, Dendro Traveler, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a>.</strong> Kirara and Collei can also work, but they’re harder to recommend. Pick one or two of these Dendro teammates to trigger Quicken, which will enable Clorinde to trigger Aggravate.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Once you have your Dendro teammate(s) picked out, you can fill in with some flex units of your choice. I recommend an Anemo unit like <strong>Sucrose </strong>or <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> to amplify Clorinde’s Electro damage. Alternatively, <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli’s</a></strong> shield provides some defensive utility while making enemies weaker to all elements. You can also double up on Electro units with <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-beidou-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beidou</a>, Yae Miko, </strong>or <strong>Kujou Sara. </strong>Mix and match as you like!</p>
 <h3 id="h-example-teams-for-quicken-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Quicken Clorinde</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Baizhu – Zhongli</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Sucrose – Beidou</li> <li>Clorinde – Yaoyao – Sucrose – Fischl</li> <li>Clorinde – Yaoyao – Kazuha – Kujou Sara</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-teams-for-hyperbloom-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Teams for Hyperbloom Clorinde</h2> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Hyperbloom teams are similar to Quicken teams, but with added Hydro. When Hydro reacts with Dendro, it creates a Dendro Core on the ground. When Clorinde hits a Dendro Core with an attack, she will trigger Hyperbloom, dealing Dendro damage to enemies.</p> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Since Hydro can remove the Quicken status from enemies, having constant Dendro application becomes more important. This increases the value of <strong>Nahida</strong> and <strong>Dendro Traveler</strong>, since these characters are better at applying Dendro from off-field. As with Quicken teams, pick one or two Dendro teammates, making sure you have at least one who can provide consistent off-field Dendro application.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Then, pick a Hydro teammate. My recommendations are <strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-furina-builds-weapons-teams-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Furina</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yelan-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a>, </strong>or<strong> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kokomi-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kokomi</a>.</strong> These characters are all capable of applying Hydro from off-field. Make sure you only have one Hydro unit, though, since too much Hydro can reduce Clorinde’s damage by interfering with Quicken.</p> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">If you still have an open team slot, and you have your Dendro and Hydro needs covered, feel free to add a flex unit of your choice. <strong>Fischl</strong> is still good, since Oz won’t target Dendro Cores, letting Clorinde trigger most of the Hyperblooms. Anemo units like <strong>Sucrose</strong> or <strong>Kazuha</strong> are great too. <strong>Zhongli</strong> makes for a good shielder, since he will increase both Clorinde’s Electro damage and Hyperbloom damage.</p>
 <h3 id="h-example-teams-for-hyperbloom-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Example teams for Hyperbloom Clorinde</h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Baizhu – Furina</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Xingqiu – Zhongli</li> <li>Clorinde – Nahida – Kokomi – Fischl</li> <li>Clorinde – Dendro Traveler – Yelan – Sucrose</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="171" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Treyarch started sprinkling in breadcrumbs of clues ahead of the upcoming <em>Black Ops 6 </em>direct, including easter eggs in <em>Warzone</em> that players have been tasked with solving. </p> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Since its inception, solving mysteries has been a staple of the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise. Whether in campaign missions, zombies, multiplayer, or Warzone, the development teams enjoy including Easter eggs and leaving the rest to players. In Season 4, Raven Software spread bunkers around Urzikstan. Players need an access card to access each bunker, but some bunkers are unaccessible with an access card and require extra problem-solving skills. </p>
