<p>Takeshi Ichikawa, the producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-quest-7-reimagined/" id="3414">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, reflects on preserving the spirit of Akira Toriyama’s designs in the remade video game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest 7 was originally released back in 2000 on the Sony PlayStation. However, over a quarter-century later, the game has been reimagined in a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/square-enix/" id="87637">Square Enix</a> release. Not only have some major gameplay mechanics been overhauled, but the 2D visuals have been overhauled as well.</p>



<p>The original game featured art by the legendary Akira Toriyama, and it was important to the 2026 development team that the spirit of that art style be preserved to remain faithful to the original drawings.</p>







<h2 id="h-preserving-the-spirit-of-toriyama-s-original-work-on-dragon-quest-7-was-essential">Preserving the Spirit of Toriyama’s Original Work on Dragon Quest 7 Was Essential</h2>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-producer-says-square-enix-tried-to-convey-the-cuteness-of-legendary-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyamas-original-designs-without-compromising-the-jrpgs-unique-atmosphere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Takeshi Ichikawa discussed the importance of preserving the cuteness of Toriyama’s designs while still capturing the game’s atmosphere for a modern audience. As for the direction of modern art, Ichikawa noted that current movies and games featuring doll designs had been well received, so they chose to combine that with Toriyama’s original designs.</p>



<p>“We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to our decision to move forward with the hand-crafted aesthetic,” he said.</p>







<p>The remake has been well-received. It currently has an 83 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic </a>score and a 7.6 user score on the platform.</p>



<p>Akira Toriyama also worked on an upcoming Dragon Ball video game project before his passing. Learn more about that upcoming game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">here</a>.</p>

              <p><span>The most memorable experience I’ve ever had with a captcha, those li’l online tests you have to complete to prove you aren’t a bot trying to DDOS someone’s blog, was being shown a puzzle grid that used images of the building I was currently sitting in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" id="741">Dead by Daylight</a>, the popular co-op survival horror game from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/behaviour-interactive/" id="1742">Behaviour Interactive</a>, is being adapted into a film. The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dead-by-daylight-movie-adaptation-writers-1236505104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a> has confirmed that Blumhouse-Atomic Monster has selected David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, known for his work on The Conjuring series, and Alexandre Aja as writers for the upcoming adaptation.</p>



<p>Alexandre Aja has writing credits, including 2006’s “The Hills Have Eyes,” but he’s also known for his directorial work. According to the report, he’s not directing this film because he’s slated to direct Under Paris 2 at Netflix. Therefore, Dead by Daylight is still looking for a director.</p>







<h2 id="h-blumhouse-founder-is-confident-in-choice-for-dead-by-daylight-writers">Blumhouse Founder Is Confident in Choice For Dead by Daylight Writers</h2>



<p>Jason Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse, praised Aja and McGoldrick in a statement. He said the pair offers a rare balance of character-focused storytelling and genre intensity. He also dubbed the pairing an excellent blueprint for attracting prospective directors.</p>



<p>“Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale,” said Blum.</p>







<h2 id="h-video-game-adaptations-are-all-the-rage">Video Game Adaptations Are All the Rage</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight is just one of many video games currently being adapted for film and TV. Sega’s House of the Dead franchise is slated for a new movie release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/house-of-the-dead-movie-casts-isabela-merced-in-lead-role/" id="174954">starring Isabela Merced</a>. Additionally, the God of War franchise is being adapted into a TV show on Prime Video. That series has already been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" id="161464">greenlit for a second season.</a></p>



<p>Also, Sega has announced that many of its classic franchises, including Streets of Rage and Shinobi, will receive animated adaptations. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/streets-of-rage-shinobi-outrun-getting-animated-adaptations/" id="176639">this link.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sega-genesis-hideki-sato-dies-dreamcast-2000668977</link>
            <guid>1436335</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>“We knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development,” </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/"><span>Hideki Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> in an oral history of Sega. “They sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes.” Sato was a steward to Sega’s biggest consoles, from the original SG-1000 right through to the Dreamcast. The storied engineer passed away this Friday, February 13, 2026, at age 77.</span></p> <p><span>Joining Sega back in 1971, Sato saw the company go through every transformation firsthand, from a U.S.-based electronics enterprise to a Japanese gaming power-house, and from a titan of the arcade hall to one of the fiercest competitors of the home console wars. While involved in the original SG series and the Master System, Sato’s star ascended in 1989 when he was promoted to director of Sega’s Research and Development department. There he and his team were tasked with a herculean feat: take down Nintendo.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>The Nintendo Entertainment System crushed Sega’s Master System. The NES rose from the ashes of the early ‘80s crash and dominated markets around the world. Sega wanted to get revenge in the second round. For the 16-bit era, they’d introduce something that synthesized their arcade strengths with what was possible at home with new, budget-friendly microchips. Sato wanted a home console with the visual appeal of an up-scale sound system, making it sleek, rounded and black with contrasted gold lettering. “That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive,” Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The result was the Mega Drive, known as the Genesis in North America. With a two-year head start on the Super Nintendo, the console was a massive hit even before the debut of </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sato oversaw all of Sega’s classic systems. The Mega Drive made Sega a household name, showing off what they did that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7nsBoqJ6s8"><span>‘Nintendon’t.’</span></a><span> The uncanny Sega Saturn was the world’s peek at the true potential of a dedicated 3D, CD-based console. And of course Sega’s swan song, the Dreamcast, ended up being a beloved underdog whose hard shake didn’t stop it from hosting the loudest, most uncompromising games of the era.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even beyond the heat of the console wars, Sato’s influence on the gaming world was felt in immeasurable ways. Magazine </span><i><span>Beep21</span></i><span> had already been compiling a new book about </span><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/1924655482024952281"><span>Sato and Sega’s hardware legacy</span></a><span>. Just last December, Sega co-founder David Rosen also </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies"><span>passed away at 95</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In Rainbow Six esports fashion, Ubisoft has used the biggest stage in the space, at the Six Invitational, to announce the setting for <strong>the next Six Invitational</strong>. As the action unfolds in Paris, France, the team took it upon themselves to declare <strong>Brazil</strong> the spot for next year’s Six Invitational, one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>This will be the <strong>second </strong>Six Invitational to hit Brazil in three years, with the 2024 event taking place in Sao Paolo and setting a record as one of the most-viewed events in the game’s history.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-goes-back-to-brazil">Six Invitational Goes Back to Brazil</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is wrapping up in Paris, France, tomorrow, and it has been one hell of a tournament thus far. It’s the first Six Invitational to land in Paris since 2021, and the European fans have been <strong>very </strong>receptive to the power of the event.</p>



<p>In a new press release, Ubisoft and BLAST unveiled a reinvigorated, three-year partnership, pushing further into an alignment that has proved fruitful over the last few years. BLAST will host the next Rainbow Six Major events, which were <strong>also </strong>revealed today:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salt Lake City R6 Major: May 8 – 17, 2026</li>



<li>Japan R6 Major: November 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>Speaking on the announcement, the CEO of BLAST, Robbie Douek, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past three years, BLAST and Ubisoft have worked side-by-side to elevate Rainbow Six esports on a global scale, from unforgettable live events to a more competitive and connected ecosystem. Renewing this partnership was a natural next step and sends a strong positive message to fans of BLAST Rainbow 6, and the competitive entertainment industry. </p>



<p>With incredible destinations confirmed for the 2026/27 season and exciting plans ahead for the ecosystem, we’re excited to continue in our mission to elevate and improve BLAST Rainbow Six Esports for fans, players, teams and brands.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, Francois-Xavier Deniele, the VP of Marketing &amp; Esports (Rainbow Six) at Ubisoft, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Renewing our partnership with BLAST is a strong vote of confidence in what we’ve built together over the past three years, and in where we want to take Rainbow Six esports next. With a unified global structure for 2026, new event destinations across the US, Japan, and Brazil, and the CNL joining as a fully integrated region, we’re creating a clearer competitive journey for teams and a stronger, more consistent experience for fans. </p>



<p>We’re excited to keep innovating, investing in the live product, and growing the ecosystem sustainably for the long term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, Deniele went on record talking about the immense success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/" id="1507">Rainbow Six Siege</a> as an esports game. He was part of the crew suggesting there’s a <strong>very long </strong>and lucrative road ahead for the game, which Ubisoft wants to become an ‘annual billionaire’ franchise.</p>

<p>Another week draws to a close, but how was it for you? Did you enjoy Valentine’s Day? Or did you miss a day of the NYT Connections puzzle and now your streak is lost, and you’re inconsolable? Whatever happened, I’m back again with another round of NYT Connections hints to help you wrap things up quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers and tips.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia Looks To Extend Death Grip Over Game Industry With New $6 Billion Acquisition]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saudi-arabia-bytedance-moonton-acecraft-mobile-ea-2000668972</link>
            <guid>1436317</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Saudi Arabia’s appetite for gaming consolidation is reportedly unsated. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Its leveraged buyout to take over <em>Battlefield 6</em> publisher Electronic Arts</a> isn’t even complete yet and it’s already eyeing other major deals, according <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/">to <em>Reuters</em></a>. This time the target is TikTok owner ByteDance’s gaming subsidiary Moonton which could sell for as much as $7 billion.</p> <p><em>Reuters</em> reports that the “broad terms” of the transaction are already agreed upon, with the official deal possibly getting announced as early as March (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-biggest-gaming-buyouts-in-history-is-reportedly-underway/1100-6538177/"><em>GameSpot</em></a>). ByteDance purchased Moonton back in 2021 for $4 billion and Saudi Arabia, through its game investment vehicle Savvy Games Group, is apparently willing to pay over 50 percent more than that just a few years later.</p>

 <p>So what the hell does Moonton make to justify that spiking valuation at a time when so many other parts of the game industry are financially plateauing? The Shanghai-based subsidiary’s biggest game is the 2016 MOBA <i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</i> which has been downloaded over a billion times. Last year it also launched the auto battler <em>Magic Chess: Go Go</em>, the RPG <em>Silver and Blood</em>, and the coop vertical shooter <em>Acecraft</em>.</p>   <p>That last game is a thinly-veiled remix of <em>Cuphead</em> and features cartoon icons like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tom, and Jerry as fighter pilots. Some players feel like it’s essentially a microtransaction casino dressed up in the retro animation stylings of Studio MDHR’s hit 2017 indie action platformer. Weirdly, the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acecraft/comments/1qgxfrw/acecraft_temporarily_suspended_in_us/">randomly went offline</a> for all U.S. players starting last month. Moonton promised make-up rewards once it returns but it’s still mysteriously MIA.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia corners the mobile gaming market</h2> <p>A $6-$7 billion sale price would make Moonton one of the top-10 biggest gaming acquisitions in history, but it’s hardly the only mobile titan Saudi Arabia has sought to gobble up in recent years. Savvy Games Group also purchased Monopoly Go maker Scopely in 2023 for $4.9 billion and Pokémon Go maker Niantic in 2025 for $3.5 billion.</p>

 <p>The EA acquisition still dwarfs those, but won’t be complete until sometime over the summer. While the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Sims</em> publisher’s board of directors and shareholders overwhelmingly approved a historic $55 billion deal to take EA private, unions and Democrats in Congress have called for investigations and regulatory due diligence before one of the largest American gaming companies is sold to a foreign government.</p> <p>Given Saudi Arabia’s direct line to the White House via President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who reportedly helped broker the deal and has a personal stake in it via <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">his own Saudi-backed investment group</a>, that seems unlikely to happen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon EUIC takes place in London this weekend, and just like previous events, the closing ceremony will provide some big indications of future events, and potentially more.</p>



<p>EUIC is another big one in 2026, with attention starting to turn towards Worlds in San Francisco in August, and players will be able to book their spot based on their performances. More importantly, however, is the move to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-champions/" id="2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Champions</a> for VGC, and release details could be imminent.</p>



<p>If you want all the details on when the closing ceremony for Pokémon EUIC 2026 takes place and how to watch it, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-euic-2026-closing-ceremony">When is The Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Showtime. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The closing ceremony for the 2026 Pokémon</strong> <strong>EUIC takes place at 11 am PT on Sunday, February 16, following the conclusion of the competitive events.</strong></p>



<p>Sunday is the final day of EUIC, and is reserved for finals, and the closing ceremony takes place after the last of the events comes to a close, so the times are subject to change. </p>



<p>The starting time for the Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony in major regions worldwide is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">7 PM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 16</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-the-pokemon-euic-2026-closing-ceremony">How to Watch The Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The closing ceremony for the EUIC 2026 will be livestreamed on both Twitch and YouTube, so you can watch all the announcements wherever you are in the world.</strong></p>



<p>Co-streaming is also supported across the entirety of the EUIC weekend, so you can also watch the closing ceremony alongside your favorite creators.</p>



<p>All major headlines and clips will also be shared across Pokémon’s social media accounts, so it will be easy to catch up on anything you might have missed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-euic-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon EUIC Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>EUIC 2026 closing ceremony is likely to feature some big news about the competitive scene of the franchise, including upcoming events.</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s closing ceremony provided details on the Road to Worlds VGC events, alongside details of the finals in San Francisco, and similar details are expected to be shared this year.</p>



<p>Most important, however, is news surrounding the release of Pokémon Champions, which is set to replace Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as the format for VGC competitions this year. It has already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be the format for Worlds this year, but there is still no concrete release window.</p>



<p>While there is still the NAIC to take place in June, it has been widely expected that EUIC will be the final major event using Scarlet &amp; Violet for competitive tournaments, and the closing ceremony could provide key details.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gtfo/" id="3598">GTFO </a>developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/10-chambers/" id="3597">10 Chambers</a> has confirmed a large number of layoffs as part of a significant restructuring.</p>



<p>Several staff members began sharing news of the restructuring on their LinkedIn profiles. Even Hjalmar Vikström, co-founder and former chief development officer, announced that he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">entering a new chapter in his career</a>, one in which he will focus on developing smaller, independent games and prioritizing his health.</p>







<h2 id="h-10-chambers-remains-focused-on-den-of-wolves">10 Chambers Remains Focused on Den of Wolves</h2>



<p>The studio then confirmed in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> that a large number of individuals were “impacted” by the restructuring. In their statement, they stated this move is to ultimately ensure that the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/den-of-wolves/" id="3599">Den of Wolves</a> game becomes what it “deserves to be.”</p>



<p>“We remain focused on the vision of Den of Wolves. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels,” they stated.</p>



<p>The studio was formed in 2015 by former Payday designers. Den of Wolves is to be the return to the heist genre for many on the team. In 2025, they announced plans to develop a documentary video series. Titled “Do the Game,” the documentary will explore the behind-the-scenes development of Den of Wolves.</p>







<h2 id="h-mass-layoffs-continue-in-gaming">Mass Layoffs Continue in Gaming</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, discussions of major layoffs and restructuring are becoming far too common in gaming. Less than a month after the release of Highguard, Wildlight Entertainment announced it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994">downsizing the development team of that game</a>. Riot Games recently shared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">a similar announcement</a> concerning the 2XKO fighting game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is perhaps the most well-known studio undergoing a restructuring. A decision that has resulted in several games being canceled. Learn more about the canceled titles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to report the latest news concerning development studios.</p>

            <p>UK Discord users have raised concerns about the company's new age verification processes, claiming that while it had originally promised that "video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device", a change in service provider allegedly now suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Discord announced its new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-mandatory-age-verification-sensitive-content-teen-by-default">revealing that age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe</a> in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content." Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features.</p>
<p>Building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK, without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands, speak on Discord server stages, or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know.</p>
<p>Originally, Discord said that video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" – "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation".</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, however, users in the UK have noted that Discord's FAQ advises British users that they <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">"may be part of an experiment"</a> where your information will be processed by age-assurance vendor, Persona. Instead of your selfie "never leaving your device", the information you submit will now "be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted". It does, however, insist that "all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used".</p><p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PC Gamer</a> posits, we're not entirely sure why Discord deviated from its initial plan, but suggested it may be due to the fact that users have worked out how to cheese its other age verification partner, k-ID. But while explicit assurances are given that Discord and k-ID "do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device," no such assurances can be given to users funnelled into the Persona "experiment".</p>

<p>That's not all, though; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r49346/oh_good_discords_age_verification_rollout_has/">some users are also unhappy</a> not just with the age verification process itself and the security of their data, but also the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">people bankrolling Persona</a>, which includes the investment fund of Palantir founder, Peter Thiel. Palantir is the data and surveillance company currently used by US federal agencies, <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/">including ICE</a>, and Thiel's name appears 2000+ times <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/tech-leaders-epstein-records-silicon-valley-sergey-brin-thiel-sinofsky-reid-hoffman-musk-gates.html">in the Epstein files</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Discord for comment.</p>
<p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-customer-service-system-breached-by-authorised-party-gaining-access-to-a-small-number-of-government-id-images">a third-party customer service system used by Discord's support teams was hacked</a>, compromising some user personal data, including government IDs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/den-wolves-layoffs-gtfo-game-awards-cyberpunk-2000668953</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Den of Wolves</em> was revealed at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2023-tga-trailers-game-previews-1851082729">The Game Awards 2023</a> with a brutal cinematic trailer teasing bloody cyberpunk heists. Developer 10 Chambers didn’t reveal any gameplay or a release date but it got the shooter on people’s radars. Over two years later it’s still not out and the studio behind prior Steam hit <em>GTFO</em> is already facing layoffs.</p> <p>News of the cuts broke first on LinkedIn on February 13 when individual developers started sharing their layoff stories. “<span data-testid="content-text">This wasn’t on my 2026 bingo card, but here we are wearing the green LinkedIn banner for a while,” wrote one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filipblom_opentowork-gamingindustry-activity-7424851079118495745-vIEU?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affected employee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. 10 Chambers later confirmed the layoffs in a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff">to <em>Game Developer</em></a> and others.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“We can confirm that we’re taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be,” it read. “This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio’s co-founders.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It continued, “We remain focused on the vision of<em> Den of Wolves</em>. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels.”</span></p> <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">From horror shooter to cyberpunk heists</h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">One person who isn’t still committed to the upcoming multiplayer shooter is 10 Chambers co-founder Hjalmar Vikström. He revealed his departure from the studio after a decade of working there earlier in the week. “Next up for me is going indie–making way smaller games, focusing on health and family, and just enjoying game development,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/">wrote on LinkedIn</a>.</p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">10 Chambers released <em>GTFO</em> in Early Access in 2019 and it immediately gripped players with its grime-y and claustrophobic coop horror gameplay. It revolved around prisoners fighting mutants and avoiding hazards while completing opaque objectives in an underground complex. It was uncompromisingly brutal and gained a devoted following as a result, occasionally spiking to nearly 20,000 concurrents on Steam and acquiring thousands of positive reviews in the process.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><em> Den of Wolves</em> applies a similarly harsh formula to sci-fi heists, but with much more ambitious trappings. It combines the smash-and-grab break-ins of a <em>Payday</em> with a second layer of nightmare-fueled gameplay where teams hack into fleshy human mind vaults to retrieve the valuable data stored in them. It’s a neat concept that received decent previews in early 2025 but there’s still no launch date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">Buying more time for <em>Den of Wolves&nbsp;</em></h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><i>“</i>I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for <em>Den of Wolves</em> in the trailer–but no,” 10 Chambers comms director Robin Björkell said alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818140?emclan=103582791474302810&amp;emgid=499465877188510087">new community gameplay trailer in December</a>. “They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">The cuts at 10 Chambers come as many game companies struggle in an ultra-completive release environment where development schedules are taking longer and investment dollars are drying up. Wildlight Entertainment, the team behind January’s new PVP shooter <em>Highguard</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">recently underwent mass layoffs</a> just weeks after launch and months after a splashy Game Awards 2025 reveal.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph">“If you know me you’ve heard this before: Making games is hard,” 10 Chamber’s outgoing cofounder wrote on LinkedIn. “And these past years have taken their toll. But thinking back I’m proud of how we managed to punch above our weight and deliver GTFO. Both the Early Access release from a team of 9, and also the releases culminating with GTFO 1.0 from the bigger 10 Chambers team. I’m grateful for the friends I’ve made and everything I’ve learned.”</p>

They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage.

It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358">stumbling to do so was Discord</a>, whose system is not only </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/someone-has-already-made-a-free-in-browser-3d-model-to-bypass-discord-age-verification-that-works-on-any-potato-computer/"><span>easy to game</span></a><span> but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos"><span>exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after</span></a><span>. Now Discord is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884"><span>looking to enforce age verification globally</span></a><span>. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.</span></p> <p><span>While the roll-out is aimed for March, </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span> reports</span></a><span> that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">managed to catch it <a href="https://t.co/Yyu0FaoDJ7">pic.twitter.com/Yyu0FaoDJ7</a></p> <p>— Folf (@itsfolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsfolf/status/2021749585111069152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of Persona’s biggest investors is the Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.5 billion and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>rallying $150 million towards it in 2021</span></a><span>. The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><i><span>404</span></i><span> uncovered</span></a><span> how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>reoccurring correspondence</span></a><span> between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">end</a> </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><i><span>Gawker</span></i></a><span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"> and how to best balkanize the planet</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Having the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, </span><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/12/discord-uk-age-verification-persona-vendor-shift/"><span>has made users a little itchy</span></a><span>. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/discord-clarifies-it-is-not-requiring-everyone-to-complete-a-face-scan-or-upload-an-id-and-will-confirm-your-age-group-using-information-we-already-have/"><span>using existing user data to guesstimate</span></a><span> if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through </span><i><span>Simpsons</span></i><span> quotes). </span></p>

 <p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord"><span>In an official update</span></a><span>, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told <em>Kotaku</em> its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, I will see you on the forums.</span></p>

<p>"We can confirm that we're taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be. This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio's co-founders," the studio stated.</p>
<p>"We recognise these changes are difficult, and we're approaching them thoughtfully. Out of respect for everyone involved, we won't comment on individual situations.</p>
<p>"We remain focused on the vision of Den of Wolves. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we'll do it through our official channels."</p>
<p>It's unclear which, if any, of the team's original nine-member team remain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/den-of-wolves-gameplay-trailer-pc-gaming-show">We last had an update on Den of Wolves back in December</a>. A teaser showcased a little bit of the pre-heist stealth gameplay, as well as live firefights and mechanical Sentinels wiping out the squad.</p>

That's three whole decades of exploring many and various regions to find monsters, battle monsters, and pocket monsters - and we've all got our personal favourites.</p>
<p>And they're not <em>always</em> just our starter, either! Sure, you build up a special relationship with your first Pokémon each generation, but there are usually a half-dozen winners who work their way into your good books as well as your team - and maybe even your <em>heart</em>, assuming you're not a cold Rock-type (and they can be awesome, too!).</p>
<p>In honour of this momentous anniversary, we'll be running a series of polls leading up to the big day where we get your votes for your favourite Pokémon from each generation. Then, we'll pit the winners against each other in a final nine-generation showdown to find out Nintendo Life readers' very favourite Pokémon from the <del>7 million</del> 1,025 discovered thus far.</p>
<p>We'll be covering a generation every day for the next nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown between the top 'mons at the end of the month. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days after going live.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/feature_best_pokemon_starters_from_all_gens_as_voted_by_you">We've looked at starters before</a>, and they're bound to poll well.

<p>While the choice is yours and we certainly don't wish to influence your decision, we feel a duty to remind you of some less obvious picks from each gen. So let's quickly ask Team NL for some underdog candidates they'll consider before casting their vote. Team?</p>




<hr>
<p>Okay, that's more than enough ado - here's the poll featuring all 151 Gen 1 Pokémon in National Dex order. Remember, you can only choose one, so pick wisely!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ashes-creation-investor-alleges-140-million-fraud/</link>
            <guid>1436206</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p id="h-">Earlier this month, the developer behind the crowdfunded fantasy MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, <strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmorpg-ashes-of-creation-suddenly-implodes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly <strong>collapsed</strong></a>, leaving backers and fans baffled <strong>less than two months after the game's launch on Steam Early Access</strong>.</p>



<p id="h-">As it turns out, though, the project <strong>had been teetering on the brink of collapse for a very long time</strong>. YouTuber <strong>NefasQS</strong>, AKA Casper, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQOTjfCIS3g&amp;pp=ygUHbmVmYXNxcw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has managed to interview one of the game's main investors</a>, <strong>Jason Caramanis</strong>, who has come forward to reveal what he alleges is a massive, years-long fraud perpetrated by <strong>Steven Sharif</strong>, founder and creative director of Intrepid Studios. Caramanis is a 57-year-old <strong>multi-level marketing (MLM) entrepreneur</strong> who made his fortune primarily through <strong>Jeunesse Global</strong>, a Florida-based anti-aging skincare and supplements MLM company, where he achieved the rank of Imperial Diamond Director. He has also joined other MLM companies over the years, and in the video, acknowledges being "at the top of the pyramids". Caramanis <strong>claims to have lost $12.5 million of his own money</strong> by investing in Ashes of Creation and believing in Sharif's empty promises.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-web-of-deception">A Web of Deception</h2>



<p>At the heart of his allegations is a key devastating claim: Steven Sharif <strong>never invested a penny of his own money into Intrepid Studios</strong>, despite publicly claiming to have contributed between <strong>$30 million</strong> and <strong>$60 million</strong> over the years. According to QuickBooks records recently obtained by Caramanis, not only did Sharif fail to invest personal capital despite claims to the contrary, but he and his partner, <strong>John Moore</strong>, who was listed as the company's Chief Financial Officer, <strong>systematically withdrew $500,000 per year in salary payments</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-money-trail">The Money Trail</h2>



<p>While public reports suggested the company had raised between <strong>$109 million</strong> and <strong>$115 million</strong>, Caramanis claims the actual figure approaches <strong>$140 million</strong> when accounting for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Ashes%20of%20Creation&amp;total_hits=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter funds</a>, Commerce Bank loans, PPP loans, and various private investments. including $2 million from <strong>Tom Alkazin</strong>, a 70-something family friend. Those were Alkazin's and his wife's life savings, which Caramanis says he regrets. It should be noted that Alkazin is also an MLM entrepreneur <strong>who made his fortune via pyramid schemes</strong>; unlike Caramanis, who was never found liable in lawsuits, Alkazin <strong><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/161222_vemma_274-_stipulated_final_order_alkazin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">settled with the Federal Trade Commission to pay $1.2 million</a></strong> (with a larger judgment of over <strong>$6.7 million</strong> partially suspended), alongside a forfeiture of 1.61 acres in San Marcos, California. Alkazin <strong>was also permanently banned from engaging in pyramid schemes</strong> and any future MLM activities.</p>



<p>But the single largest victim of Intrepid Studios and the whole Ashes of Creation project is apparently <strong>Robert Dawson</strong>, a wealthy investor whom Caramanis introduced to Sharif several years ago in Las Vegas. According to Caramanis, between 2022 and 2025, <strong>Dawson injected approximately $80 million of his own capital into the failing company</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-transparency-no-governance">No Transparency, No Governance</h2>



<p>Despite contractual obligations and investor demands, Sharif allegedly refused to provide books and records, tax returns, or QuickBooks files for 9 years. Caramanis claims he was promised a board seat in 2019 but <strong>never attended a single board meeting</strong> for a straightforward reason: because <strong>none were ever called</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Do you know how many board meetings I've been to? Zero. Do you know how many board meetings he's ever called? Zero. The only thing that guy's good at is bullshitting people. And he might be a good creative director. He might be a good gamer, but everything else is full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;].</em></p>



<p>Even a lawsuit filed by Caramanis demanding access to company records yielded nothing. He allegedly obtained the QuickBooks files <strong>only three days before the livestream</strong>, provided by Dawson's accountant, <strong>Ryan Ogden</strong>, after months of forensic review.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-mansion-and-the-lies">The Mansion and the Lies</h2>



<p>The California mansion from which Sharif regularly livestreamed updates on Ashes of Creation's development <strong>became a symbol of the alleged deception</strong>. Caramanis claims Sharif and John were originally renting the property, not owning it as many assumed. When they eventually purchased it, the down payment allegedly came from company funds, or rather, the very salaries they were paying themselves while claiming to be "losing everything" on the game.</p>



<p>The house drama reached a crisis point in 2024 when the original owner's mortgage came due and Sharif couldn't refinance due to Commerce Bank holding a second position as collateral for company loans. Facing foreclosure, Sharif <strong>turned to his investors once more</strong>, and Caramanis and Dawson came to his rescue again by contributing another $2 million to save the house.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-company-burning-money">A Company Burning Money</h2>



<p>By 2025, Intrepid Studios was <strong>hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate</strong>. The company's monthly operating expenses exceeded $2.5 million, while revenue from in-game purchases ranged from $150,000 to $200,000, resulting in a monthly loss of around $2.3 million. At this burn rate, <strong>even Dawson's massive capital infusions couldn't sustain the operation indefinitely</strong>.</p>



<p>The situation became dire in late 2024. Multiple payrolls were missed around the Alpha 2 release, which, as those who followed the game already know, got delayed by several weeks. Moreover, Alpha 2 bonuses, which had been promised to employees three months in advance, <strong>were delayed indefinitely</strong>.</p>



<p>The financial crisis affected more than just employees, though. In December 2025, cloud services provider <strong>SADA Systems</strong> <a href="https://allaboutlawyer.com/ashes-of-creation-lawsuit-game-studio-shuts-down-after-850k-breach-of-contract-claim-mass-layoffs-hit-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit with the <strong>New York Supreme Court</strong></a>, seeking <strong>$852,630</strong> for nearly three years of unpaid Google Cloud Platform services dating back to September 2022. The services were cancelled in April 2025 due to non-payment.</p>



<p>When confronted about the lawsuit on Reddit in December 2025, Sharif <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1pjobvr/comment/nth5pe9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed it as 'peanuts'</a>, claiming that '<strong>$800k is a week's worth of opex for the studio</strong>' and suggesting that such disputes were fairly common and would be resolved in a similar manner to other disputes Intrepid had seen before. Yet, mere weeks later, the company was unable to process payroll and had to shut down entirely. The SADA case revealed that Intrepid <strong>had been technically insolvent for years</strong>, unable to pay even basic infrastructure bills for cloud services, yet still kept raising millions from new investors, including most of Dawson's $80 million between 2022 and 2025, according to Caramanis's testimony.</p>



<p>Under the light of this new information, <strong>the timing of the December 2025 Steam Early Access launch now appears even more strategic</strong>. The release technically satisfied the Kickstarter promises, as we had postulated in our previous report, blocked refund claims, and generated an estimated $3 to 5 million in revenue based on 220K-320K copies sold. It also <strong>provided the final pool of money that Sharif would seize</strong> through Commerce Bank just two months later.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-final-betrayal">The Final Betrayal</h2>



<p>By January 2026, Robert Dawson had reached his breaking point. Having invested $80 million <strong>with no return and facing continued operational losses</strong>, he initiated what Caramanis describes as a reasonable restructuring plan. The proposal <strong>called for 60-70% staff layoffs to make the company financially sustainable</strong>, a new funding round requiring all existing investors to contribute 25% of their previous investment to maintain equity, and a new role for Sharif as Creative Director with earnout-based equity tied to company performance rather than immediate ownership.</p>



<p><strong>Sharif, however, flat-out refused</strong>. Caramanis revealed that he demanded immediate equity despite having contributed no capital. When negotiations failed, Sharif allegedly <strong>took action that would destroy the company entirely</strong>.</p>



<p>Between approximately January 26 and 31, Sharif resigned as Creative Director and <strong>executed what Caramanis calls an act of sabotage</strong>. He had Commerce Bank send a letter to <strong>Valve</strong> claiming the Steam revenue from the December early access launch, approximately <strong>$3.7 million</strong>, that had been earmarked for the February 1st payroll. This money <strong>was instead used to pay off Commerce Bank's loan secured by Sharif's house</strong>, releasing $1.5 to $1.6 million in escrow to him personally. The seizure of funds left the company <strong>unable to make payroll and effectively bankrupted it</strong>. Caramanis portrays Steven's seizure of the Steam revenue as a <strong>deliberate act of sabotage</strong>, thus destroying the company rather than accepting the performance-based compensation proposed by main investor Robert Dawson.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-human-cost">The Human Cost</h2>



<p>Beyond the staggering financial losses, the human toll is immeasurable. As mentioned earlier, Tom and Bethany Alkazin, now in their seventies, <strong>lost their $2 million life savings</strong> and face financial problems they'll likely "never come back from," according to Caramanis. He himself <strong>admits to crying at night</strong> and breaking down during a dinner with Dawson in Beverly Hills, when the weight of the losses and betrayal finally overwhelmed him.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Caramanis can bounce back from this, but others won't be able to. The company's employees, many of whom believed in the project and worked tirelessly to bring it to fruition, <strong>found themselves unpaid and betrayed</strong>. The gaming community, which had invested not just money but years of hope and anticipation, <strong>could just watch as their dream of a promising new MMORPG collapsed</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-next">What Comes Next</h2>



<p><strong>Robert Dawson now controls the Ashes of Creation intellectual property</strong> through foreclosure proceedings and his position as a secured creditor. Caramanis holds first-position UCC filings that predate Commerce Bank's involvement. Multiple lawsuits are reportedly imminent, including from TFE Games (which invested $5 million), Commerce Bank (which Caramanis claims was defrauded with false revenue reports), and numerous other investors. <strong>Caramanis alleges that Sharif committed federal crimes by booking investor loans as revenue on tax returns</strong>. It's a claim he says he can prove with documentation, including <strong>380 pages of text messages</strong>, emails demanding financial records, UCC filings, contracts, QuickBooks files showing cash flows, and correspondence with Commerce Bank. He has offered to share these materials with content creators and the community to substantiate his claims:</p>



<p><em>There's nothing I'm saying that is slanderous or libelous about Stephen. He's a pathological nutcase liar. And guess what? You're going to see numerous lawsuits come out against him for fraud, for whatever else.</em> <em>All this is going to come out in litigation.</em></p>



<p>Caramanis believes that <strong>the rest of Intrepid's employees were also victims of Sharif's alleged deceptions</strong>. His anger is directed solely at Sharif, his partner John, and Sharif's mother, all of whom he accuses of being complicit in the fraud.</p>



<p>As for the actual game, <strong>Dawson is reportedly exploring options to continue developing Ashes of Creation</strong>, but key technical staff allegedly refuse to communicate with him, having been "poisoned" against investors by Sharif, claimed Caramanis. Meanwhile, Sharif reportedly continues to moderate the official Discord server, timing out critics and maintaining his connection to the community. Throughout the interview, Caramanis painted a picture of systematic psychological manipulation:</p>



<p><em>Go look up NPD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It describes him to a T. He's the most narcissistic tool I've ever met in my entire life.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-a-dream">The End of a Dream</h2>



<p>For the thousands of Ashes of Creation supporters who dreamed of playing a polished, final version of the ambitious MMORPG, which sought to bring about "<strong>the rebirth of the genre</strong>", and for the investors who lost millions believing in that dream, <strong>the allegations paint a cautionary tale about trust, transparency, and the devastating consequences when both are absent</strong>. The truth of these allegations will ultimately be determined in courtrooms, but regardless of the legal outcomes, <strong>the collapse of Intrepid Studios may enter the history books as one of the most spectacular failures in the gaming industry</strong>.</p>



<p>Steven Sharif hasn't publicly responded yet to the allegations shared by Caramanis. On Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Steven_AoC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he hasn't been active since Friday, January 23</a>; on Discord, he posted the now-infamous statement on January 31, revealing to the community that he resigned because he '<strong>could not ethically agree with or carry out</strong>' the board's directions. Of course, should he provide his side of the story, we'll update this report accordingly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>My ongoing quest to turn my iPhone into one of my favorite consoles of all time has led me to a curiously named controller. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir’s Pocket Taco</a> is only barely pocketable, and distinctly lacking in taco fillings, <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-pocket-taco">but for $35</a>, it’s an excellent and easy way to turn your phone into a Game Boy-inspired handheld for playing retro games that don’t require a pair of thumbsticks.</p><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth">Abxylute M4 mobile controller</a> that attaches to phones using magnets, or the Backbone Pro that sandwiches your device between a split gamepad, the Pocket Taco uses a hinged mechanism that, for lack of a better description, bites onto the bottom half of your smartphone.</p><div id=":R1hir6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>Inside the Pocket Taco are soft silicone pads on either side that grip your phone without damaging it.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The ergonomics aren’t as good as standalone controllers, but the Pocket Taco is quite comfortable to play with.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Inside the Pocket Taco, you’ll find soft silicone pads on either side that securely grip your device without scratching it or leaving any bite marks. The hold feels satisfyingly secure, and while my iPhone could slightly shift from side to side while inside the Pocket Taco, at no point did it ever feel at risk of falling out on its own.</p><p>The Pocket Taco’s hinge expands wide enough to attach to smartphones still inside bulky cases, and its open sides can accommodate phones and devices wider than the controller itself. You could use it with an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review">iPad Mini,</a> for example, although I didn’t have the chance to test the ergonomics of such a setup.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo announced a similar Game Boy-style controller</a> for smartphones at CES 2026, featuring a front panel that can fully flip down. I couldn’t understand why anyone would want that feature, but after playing with the Pocket Taco for a week, I now understand why 8BitDo took that approach.</p><p>The front panel on the Pocket Taco can only hinge outward about 45 degrees, blocking the lower part of your smartphone’s screen while attached to your device. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854303/8bitdo-mobile-smartphone-controller-ios-android-flippad-game-boy">8BitDo’s FlipPad</a> gives you full access to your smartphone’s screen and UI while it’s attached, but I frequently found myself having to completely remove the Pocket Taco if I wanted to flip over to another app, or even just unlock my phone.</p><div id=":R1k2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>A passthrough hole on the bottom of the Pocket Taco lets you plug in a power cable, assuming your device’s charging port is centered.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>A hard plastic carrying case is included, but the Pocket Taco is a bit too thick to be comfortably pocketed.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I haven’t tested the USB-C 8BitDo FlipPad yet, but a big advantage of the larger Pocket Taco is that it connects to your device over Bluetooth and has its own 600mAh rechargeable battery that won’t drain your phone. Opening the Pocket Taco powers it on and automatically pairs the controller with the last device you used — in my case, an iPhone 16 Pro. GameSir doesn’t list iOS as being officially supported, only Android, but I was able to connect to the Pocket Taco and my iPhone recognized it as a “DualShock 4 Wireless Controller.”</p><p>The Pocket Taco turns off automatically when you remove it from your phone. It powers up and reconnects quickly, though, so having to occasionally remove the controller to access your phone’s screen isn’t a huge inconvenience.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Pocket Taco turns on automatically when attached to a phone, but it can also be powered on manually and used as a portable standalone wireless gamepad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Pocket Taco’s home button can also be used to manually power it on and off when it isn’t attached to a device, allowing it to be used as a standalone rechargeable Bluetooth controller. It was easy to pair with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>.</p><div id=":R1mir6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Pocket Taco’s controls look and feel very similar to the original Game Boy’s, but with a few more buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Two sets of shoulder buttons can be found on the back of the Pocket Taco, with a USB-C charging port in between them.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four face buttons and D-pad all feel good with a solid click when pressed, and despite it being a little narrower than the original Game Boy, my large hands found the Pocket Taco extremely comfortable to play with. The double pair of shoulder buttons on the back were easy to reach, and the rounded edges on the bottom of the Pocket Taco didn’t dig into the fingers I was using to support the controller and my phone.</p><p>There are just a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when choosing what games to play, or how to play them. Unlike the Abxylute M4 or the Backbone controllers, GameSir made no attempt to squeeze thumbsticks or sliding joysticks onto the Pocket Taco. So it’s better suited for playing retro games from the 16-bit era and earlier that don’t have 3D environments with a camera to control.</p><div id=":R1o2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The GameSir mobile app shrinks to half screen with the Pocket Taco attached, and lets you update firmware and remap the controller’s buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>You may need to make some adjustments if an app or emulator centers a game vertically onscreen, as it will be partially blocked with the Pocket Taco attached.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I primarily tested the Pocket Taco with Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and GBA games played through the Delta emulator and RetroArch on iOS. The Pocket Taco worked great with both, but you’ll want to make sure you’re using an app with skins or layout options that can position the game closer to the top of your device’s screen. When I first tested the Pocket Taco with Delta, I turned off the emulator’s default skin to remove on-screen controls. That resulted in the game being vertically centered on my iPhone and partially covered by the Pocket Taco. It was easy to fix, but note that the controller can only be used in a vertical orientation.</p><p>8BitDo hasn’t announced pricing or a release date for its FlipPad yet, so I’m still curious how effective that smaller accessory will be at turning my smartphone into a handheld console, given its limitations. The <a href="https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-pocket-taco">Pocket Taco isn’t expected to ship until March 2026</a>, but for $35, you get excellent controls, solid ergonomics, reliable Bluetooth connectivity, nearly universal smartphone compatibility, and the ability to use it as a standalone wireless gamepad.</p><p><em>Photography by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/877491/gamesir-pocket-taco-wireless-bluetooth-controller-clamp-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

The biggest surprise is when they prove to be all practical.</span></p> <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-iv-blood-pc-contest-interview/"><span>Over at </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span>, journalist Nathan Grayson has been bothered by a blood-fueled gaming PC, which apparently uses real-deal human plasma for liquid coolant, ever since Blizzard gave it away to <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">promote </a></span><i><span>Diablo IV</span></i><span> in 2023. Grayson tried to shake down PR reps and hardware experts hoping to uncover how much blood was in there, whose blood it was, and whether such an unholy contraption is at all practical. No dice.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, Grayson did succeed in tracking down the original winner of this infernal machine, a streamer by the name of </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/storms888"><span>Storms888</span></a><span>. While it didn’t solve the gross mysteries that got under his skin, Grayson did learn something just as shocking: the damn thing still works. Two years later the rig continues pumping its blood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I haven’t seen any drops in performance since the day I got it,” Storms888 tells Grayson. “Did leak a ton though.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The streamer says that he believes the liquid coolant to be a cocktail of human blood and more conventional ingredients. But there is some amount of blood. Blizzard sent him replacement vials and documentational slips confirming the red stuff came from human donors. Storms888 said it’s an incredible rig for his purposes, which include livestreaming “</span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> at ultra settings.” And with RAM prices through the roof, who can blame him for not upgrading.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is hardly the first time the deep red stuff has been used in a promotional stunt, nor the first time it was batched to accomplish it. In 1977, Marvel Comics mixed their ink with blood donated from each member of KISS for their funny book debut. Lil Nas X did something similar, drawing blood for </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kiss-used-band-members-blood-in-marvel-comic-book-2021-3"><span>a custom pair of Nikes</span></a><span> to promote 2021’s </span><i><span>Montero</span></i><span>. Blood, it turns out, is in you to give. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If Blizzard, Activision or Microsoft were to pull this stunt again, or cram any other body parts into giveaway hardware, it wouldn’t even make </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473"><span>the list of the most</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-files-bobby-kotick-activision-ghislaine-maxwell-2000665456"><span>nauseating things</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"><span>to come out of them</span></a><span> in recent history.</span></p>

 <p><span>Storms888 remains chuffed by his useful, practical, even, gross-out gift.

            <p>Valve is testing the ability to permit Steam reviewers to include hardware specs in their reviews.</p>
<p>Though only available to participants in Steam's Client Beta for now, reviewers will be able to "attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page".</p>
<p>If it rolls out to all, it'll help players identify if any performance issues are restricted to certain specs or configurations, and if anyone else with a similar rig is having the same problems.</p>
<p>The patch also fixes an issue wherein streaming could throttle downloads even after you've finished streaming, and adds the option to provide anonymised framerate data.</p>
<p>"When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on," Valve explains in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962">beta client patch notes</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-reviews-set-to-show-a-players-specs-so-its-easier-to-know-if-youll-share-their-experience-or-they-misread-the-minimum/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS."</p>
<p>Here's the full patch note:</p>
<blockquote><p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the option to attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page</li>
<li>Added the option to provide anonymised framerate data. When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on. This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Families</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved setting layout and navigation on desktop, deck and mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Streaming</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where streaming could leave downloads throttled even after the stream stopped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in Proton games showing up as "Not valid on current platform" for users with very large libraries when using offline mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Deck</p>
<ul>
<li>When submitting feedback on whether you agree with a Deck Verified rating, if you disagree we'll now ask for the reason. Providing a reason is optional.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Talking of Steam, a couple of weeks ago, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-steam-users-could-receive-compensation-after-uk-rules-valve-case-can-proceed">meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Colonialism is not merely about occupying nations. It’s a project of mass violence, part of which involves total erasure and the widespread theft of some of the most culturally significant artifacts in the world. Even today, colonizing nations proudly display stolen artifacts, acting as peacocking robbers under the guise of tourism. See, for example, the British Museum’s continual hold of the Egyptian Rosetta Stone, the so-called Benin Bronzes, and the Ethiopian Maqdala collection. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/12/restitution-row-how-nigerias-new-home-for-the-benin-bronzes-ended-up-with-clay-replicas">Colonized nations have sought to reclaim their stolen culture</a>.</p><p>But what happens when kind requests and diplomatic maneuvers are not only insufficient but undeserving of the ongoing crime? This is where the fantasy of the moral heist comes in — and no game has done it better than <em>Relooted</em>.</p><p>Developed by South African studio Nyamakop, <em>Relooted</em> focuses on a group of lovable, albeit unprofessional, Johannesburg-based thieves from different African countries. They have a singular goal: Reclaim from colonizer nations what was stolen from Africa. Playing as the frontwoman Nomali, a world-class parkour athlete, you help start this ragtag group inspired by her grandmother, a history professor. The game is an Africanfuturist (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nyamakop_some-screenshots-from-relooted-and-why-we-activity-7343997849002565632-0RKq">as opposed to Afrofuturist</a>) 2.5D heist-’em-up platformer, sending Nomali and her team around the Global North, infiltrating museums, private collections, and banks to take back legendary but stolen artifacts.</p><p>Once acquired, the team anonymously seeks to deposit them in the the Museum of Black Civilisations in Senegal. What I found surprising was that the museum, like every artifact, is in fact entirely real.</p><p>In mission briefings in your Batcave-like base, you get a genuine short history lesson on the artifact and, through it, Africa’s colonized past. For example, did you know the modern Republic of Benin, a West African nation, and the historical and powerful Kingdom of Benin (which reached its peak in the 15th century), located in what is now Nigeria, are different? Legendary masks of this kingdom were looted by colonizers and not returned, held by, among others, the British Museum.</p><p>In the fictional world of <em>Relooted</em>, this is precisely where Nomali and her crew come in. If the nations that profited off theft and stolen labor won’t return the artifacts, then Nomali and co. will simply take them back. They’re benevolent thieves; the team doesn’t make a profit and only will only steal what was previously stolen. As a lawyer, I have qualms, since in most legal systems theft of even your own property is still theft — you cannot break into your robber’s home to reclaim your phone, for example. But as someone whose ancestors were colonized by the British in India before moving to a British-occupied South Africa, this was deeply fulfilling and morally wholesome.</p><p>Every mission sees you scouting the level for robot guards, exits, and additional artifacts. You discuss this with your team, each of whom provides a different skill that is itself a mechanic in the game: Your brother is a locksmith who can break into doors or safes, while another team member is a professional acrobat who can use Batman-like skills to reach impossible areas. After scouting, Nomali is then tasked with retrieval of the artifact(s).</p><p>However, you must also make sure of your exit. This is the most exciting part for me, as it requires you to plan your escape route before setting off the alarm. After Nomali snags the object, you must then follow a perfect route out without getting caught by chasing drones. You can also plan to steal a few artifacts, meaning you need to be clever about which item to steal first; it could be that the item closest to the entrance is in fact <em>not</em> the best first option, as it is awkwardly placed. Careful planning and running through the route, placing your teammates in the right areas, all leads to a clockwork-like heist that would make Arsène Lupin proud.</p><p>The game is a cerebral platformer, a satisfying mixture of brains and twitch responses. You feel the exhilaration of a fast chase, as well as the satisfaction of a well-considered exit plan with the coordinated efforts of your teammates, when executed properly and all artifacts are in tow.</p><p>The stages are varied, sometimes not using the names as we know them now. For instance, the US is known as “the Shiny Place,” depicted as a mixture of Las Vegas and New York, with more cyberpunk aesthetics. Another is a European mansion, home of a “collector,” depicted in dark, rain-drenched cobblestone streets and with creepy paintings haunting cold brick walls. Stages usually last between five to 10 minutes, unless you repeat them due to a faulty plan or execution.</p><p>Repetition does set in, despite a wider story eventually unfolding. There’s only so much variety when dealing with 2D stages and limited mechanics, but the game does not wear out its welcome. The graphics are quite dated; though it is attempting to look like a Pixar film or other modern animation productions, character faces are flat and dialogue animations look stiff and basic.</p><p>However, parkour animations are fluid, and the colors and world are vibrant. Nomali felt great to control, especially when you get into a “flow” of parkour movement. This is heightened by an incredible soundtrack from composers Nick Horsten and Dustin van Wyk, which is able to both soothe as ambience and pump up for the action set pieces. Using a mixture of electronic and traditional instruments, the soundscapes capture the Africanfuturistic theme as well as the ’80s James Bond espionage aesthetics for our sneaky thieves.</p><p><em>Relooted</em> is very special to me as a South African. Not only is it made by South Africans, but it centres on a <em>pan</em>-African group, working together for a common goal of reclaiming what was stolen by colonial occupiers. Ugandan scholar <a href="https://roape.net/2022/12/02/surrounded-an-ethnography-of-new-colonialism/#:~:text=A%20recent%20study%20put%20the,the%20old%20form%20of%20colonialism.">Yusuf Serunkuma cites one calculation</a> that puts the loss Africa experienced through colonization between 1960–2010 at an estimated $152 trillion. To think of where my country and continent would be today were it not for the enormous theft and exploitation makes me continually angry. Even today, African citizens still have to visit former colonizer nations to view their own history.</p><p><em>Relooted</em> serves as a fine and righteous outlet for the moral rage at the unfairness and unjust occupation and horror experienced by this continent, and fulfills double roles as a history lesson and fun heist platformer. Here’s hoping more people discover just how bloody and unfair African history really was — and how wonderful, beautiful, and inspiring our continent and its people remain.</p><p><sub>Relooted <em>is available now on the Xbox and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAwNTg="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tauriq Moosa</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/878121/relooted-review-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>
