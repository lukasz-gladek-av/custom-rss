			<p>SEGA and developer Sports Interactive have announced Football Manager 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS, and Android. It will officially launch on November 26, 2024. The game will have a slightly different title for each platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Football Manager 25 will be on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass</li>
<li>Football Manager 25 Console will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC via Microsoft Store and <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-xbox-game-pass-positive-football-manager-head-says/">Xbox Game Pass</a></li>
<li>Football Manager 25 Mobile will be available on iOS and Android as a Netflix-exclusive</li>
<li>Football Manager 25 Touch will be available on Nintendo Switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those who are eager to snag this game, Football Manager 25 pre-orders are now available. Those who pre-order it for PC will get a 10% discount. At the moment, the console version's pre-orders are not open and will open up at a later date. For those who played Football Manager 2024, the save data from that game can be carried over to Football Manager 25.</p>
<p>Football Manager 25 is set to be a rule-breaker in the franchise. Players will be able to compete in the world's biggest league or try to accomplish new victories in Women's Football, which is a first for the franchise. Women's Football will seamlessly join the new game, with both having the same ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now that there are both men and women on the playing field, Football Manager 25 has more playable leagues and nations than ever, and features the biggest player database in football gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new iteration in the franchise has swapped over to the Unity Engine after previously using the match Engine for Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023. In a previous statement regarding Football Manager 2024, Miles Jacobson stated that it'd be the "last of its kind," with many fans of the franchise speculating that the franchise was ending.</p>
<p>However, now that it's been confirmed that they are swapping over to Unity Engine as well as adding Women's Football to the game, it's clearer than ever what they meant by that statement, as this is game-changing for the Football Manager franchise, especially after 20 years of the franchise.</p>
<p>Those who plan on picking up the new game will get to experience a new, smarter user interface which provides key info, as well as real-life volumetric player animations and enhanced graphical fidelity to give players the most realistic experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate the announcement of Football Manager 25, there is now an Announce Trailer showcasing the new era of the franchise.</p>

But Harada’s personal “dream” character of Colonel Sanders has yet to make an appearance—and based on how his meeting with KFC went, it seems like the fried chicken empire’s mascot will never trade blows with Heihachi Mishima or Kuma. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with <em>The Gamer</em></a></span>, Harada explained that “a long time ago” he wanted to do a KFC x <em>Tekken </em>crossover, saying: “I wanted to have Colonel Sanders from Kentucky Fried Chicken fight. So, I asked to use Colonel Sanders and [went] to the head office in Japan.” </p><p>This meeting didn’t go down well, with Harada saying KFC gave him “a bad look,” so he decided to give up on his dream cameo character. As for getting a Waffle House stage, something Tekken fans have jokingly asked about in the past, Harada said “It’s not something that we can accomplish on our own.” Waffle House would have to agree and seeing how KFC reacted, I’m not sure it will happen. </p><h2 id="h4654"><a id=""></a>Harada has wanted a KFC x <em>Tekken</em> crossover for years</h2><p>Harada talked about getting Colonel Sanders in <em>Tekken</em> before.

So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them. But it just goes to show how difficult these types of discussions are.”</p><p>In 2021, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/hk8qie2mImc?t=877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/hk8qie2mImc?t=877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harada once again talked about adding the Colonel to <em>Tekken</em></a></span>, explaining that the team has a plan for the mascot. </p><p>“Quite honestly, I dream of Colonel Sanders from KFC in <em>Tekken</em>.

It will be really brilliant.”<br></p><p> “The marketing department, however, does not want to agree, because they think that players will not like it,” said Harada. “Everyone advises us against it at every turn.

Lucky for you, the Enter the Mysterium bundle actually gives you several different ways to experience the seminal puzzle game. If you played this year’s Riven then you might be inclined to play 2020’s <em>Myst </em>remake, as it also updates the original game with beautiful graphics and free-movement throughout the world. To get something closer to classic <em>Myst </em>you can play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/myst-masterpiece-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/myst-masterpiece-edition"><em>Myst: Masterpiece Edition</em></a></span>, which retains the point-and-click movement and low-fi aesthetics of the 1993 original. The third and final version of the game available in the bundle, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672"><em>realMyst: Masterpiece Edition</em></a></span>, lies somewhere in between the other two, offering 3D movement that makes traversing the world easier in addition to updated graphics (at least by 2014 standards) that still feel in line with the original release’s artstyle. Each game has its pros and cons depending on the type of experience you are looking for, but every one retains the impressive atmosphere and challenging puzzles of the original, so you can’t really go wrong.</p><p>Beyond <em>Myst </em>and <em>Riven</em>, there are three more games in the series. Those are—in order—<em>Exile</em>, <em>Revelation</em>, and <em>End of Ages</em>. While the puzzle-solving aspect of the <em>Myst </em>series loses some of its charm when you play titles back to back, it makes up for it with a sprawling narrative with twists and turns. It’s a story about ambition, betrayals, and family intrigue.</p><p>But the bundle isn’t just about <em>Myst </em>and its sequels. There are also a number of other titles from developer Cyan Inc. in the bundle worth checking out. Specifically, <em>Firmament </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-myst-team-s-new-game-obduction-starts-strong-1785752672"><em>Obduction</em></a></span><em> </em>are fascinating because of how they iterate on the genre’s formula, with a timeless otherworldly feel and new types of puzzles for players to figure out. In total, the bundle gets you 13 games for $25 as well as a coupon for this year’s <em>Riven </em>remake, if you haven’t played it already. For hours of puzzle-solving fun, that price is an absolute bargain worth taking advantage of </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hideo Kojima says that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is only about “30%-40%” complete. </p>



<p>In an appearance at Tokyo Game Show, Kojima talked about the franchise, including where things stand with the upcoming sequel. He told the gathered crowd that the game isn’t halfway done, but didn’t show much concern about it.</p>

<p>Some of the work that needed to be done (h/t <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-tgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) includes re-recording all of the dialogue for the game in Japanese for localization.</p>



<p>He then reiterated that the game will still release in 2025 as planned.</p>



<p>“I haven’t said the release date today, but the release date has already been decided, and I’m currently working on it in preparation for that,” he said</p>



<p>He added that while the date will be announced next year, “unforeseen circumstances” prevent them from revealing it sooner.</p>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-reveals-death-stranding-2-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2022</a>, Death Stranding 2 is the sequel to the 2019 original.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-multiple-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If a Final Fantasy IX remake would ever get developed, it would likely be a multi-title project like the Final Fantasy VII Remake project, according to Naoki Yoshida.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Games</a> about which entry in the series he would like to remake, the Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer said that, among the classic entries in the series, he would like to remake the third game, originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan back in 1990. He also acknowledged the demand for a Final Fantasy IX remake, adding that it would be difficult to create as the huge "volume" of the original makes him wonder if it's possible to remake the entire game in a single title.</p>
<p>This statement is rather interesting, considering there's a huge possibility that a Final Fantasy IX remake could indeed be in the works. Originally leaked via the huge GeForce NOW leak from a few years back, which correctly revealed multiple Square Enix releases before their official announcement, this <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-ready-release-prettier/">unannounced remake</a> is supposedly rather faithful to the original, and not as ambition as the aforementioned Final Fantasy VII Remake project. However, as the years have gone by without a reveal, it is entire possible Square Enix canned the project or rebooted it as a more ambitious project that could require multiple entries as Yoshi-P said, although with the disappointing performance on the market of the latest entries in the series, it is unlikely Square Enix would commit to such a massive project.</p>
<p>While an official remake has yet to be made, PC players can enjoy Final Fantasy IX with better visuals and additional features with the Moguri Mod. Version 9.0 released <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-moguri-mod-9-0-download/">last month</a>, introducing visual improvements and more.</p>

<p>Fallout 76 has been on the market since 2018, but for some reason, Bethesda Game Studios has always neglected to include a text-based chat in the game. There are local voice chat options, but that’s about it – which presents a considerable accessibility issue. That’s being addressed as we speak, with the game’s test server getting access to a new text-based solution.</p>



<p>That’s where the catch sits – it’s tied to accessibility. It’s a text-to-speech or a speech-to-text function designed to aid gamers who can’t use their voice to communicate, or those who have impaired vision.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-progress">It’s Progress</h2>



<p>In the ‘PTS’, players are discovering the option to turn on text-to-speech and speech-to-text mechanics.</p>



<p>If you’re a Fallout 76 player, you might have run into a need to use text chat to communicate with other users over the years, but you’ll have been met with a brick wall as the function simply never existed. That’s set to change.</p>



<p>It works as you’d imagine. If you type something into the text box (accessible on PC by pressing ‘.’) you’ll hear an AI-powered voice speaking your words to anyone close enough to hear them. Similarly, any users speaking close by using traditional voice chat will have their words transcribed by AI and written into the text box.</p>



<p>In Fargassier’s video below, you can see that the function isn’t perfect. It doesn’t always catch what you’re saying very clearly and the AI voice isn’t the best, plus there are some concerns regarding filtering:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s still a step in the right direction for Bethesda Game Studios. Even if it has taken this long to implement something relatively simple, it’s an extra consideration that ticks a huge accessibility box. It’ll need some tweaking before it’s perfect, but that’s the point of the Fallout 76 PTS.</p>



<p>Many PC players have argued that there has been a mod live on Nexus for years that adds text chat to the game, but it’s not an ideal solution and you could run into a ToS infringement for running it.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this new feature making its way into Fallout 76? Let us know on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">the Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-the-first-preview.996465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-is-us-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let’s get this one out of the way: Hell is Us isn’t a soulslike. Nor is it an open-world game. Instead, it aims to separate itself from other action adventures by emphasising investigation and discovery, ushering you to get lost in its weirdness. That’s exactly what happened to me during my two-hour hands-on with developer Rogue Factor’s latest, an arresting mixture of medieval and sci-fi aesthetics set against a 90s European civil war backdrop. I enjoyed its approach to tense melee combat encounters and information-gathering puzzles, but what excites me the most is what I don’t know – where its intriguing story will lead me next.</p><p>Hell is Us is one of the bleaker games I’ve played in a while. Upon entering a village surrounded by muddy marshland, I’m greeted by a mass grave, bodies hanging from a tree, and the yearnful strings of a local’s violins. You’ll become used to such scenes during the early hours of venturing through the fictional European nation of Hadea, circa an alternate 1990s. It’s a country ravaged by civil war that has cut itself off from the rest of the world, and the place that main character Rémi fled as a child. Fast forward years later and he’s back in his homeland having smuggled himself over the border in search of the parents who sent him off for a better life.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Hell is Us: Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The first step of the mystery brings me to a lonely farmhouse, the basement of which the owner now calls home. Through conversation about my father and the larger conflict at play, I’m able to pull on a thread that eventually reveals the village of Jova as his last known location. Hell is Us wants you to take your time talking to people and investigating every avenue of conversation. Indeed, being a wandering detective appears to be as much a part of its gameplay as its punishing combat (more on that in a bit). It forces you to observe its world and the people trapped in it. You are deprived of map markers, waypoints, and – thanks to that 90s setting – a mobile phone. Instead of those tools, you are reliant on directions and clues given by mouth or read on scattered notes.</p><p>In order to reach Jova I’ll need a vehicle, and it just so happens that a military APC is parked nearby. Retrieving its engine’s lost key appears a simple fetch quest at first, but Hell is Us’ emphasis on investigation means this task quickly reveals itself to be a much more complex problem. I talk to a wounded soldier who gives me rough directions through a forest, which in turn leads me to a puzzle where I need to match symbols on a door using a contraption. The gateway unlocked, I then delve deep into the tomb inside. This is where things get weird.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Foes take the form of milky white humanoids that move slowly yet menacingly, echoing images from the finale of Annihilation.</p></div><p>During a conversation at gamescom 2024, creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête revealed to me the influence that Annihilation plays on Hell is Us. The team has been inspired not just by the visuals of Alex Garland’s striking 2018 film, but also the overall off-kilter tone of Jeff VanderMeer’s trilogy of novels it’s based on. It can be heard in the unsettling score that soundtracks Hadea, filled with droning, stuttering electronics and twinkling otherworldliness, but becomes much more evident when you’re face-to-face with enemies. </p><p>The basic foes take the form of milky white humanoids that move slowly yet menacingly, echoing images from the finale of Garland’s movie. Others are more developed quadrupeds that possess blades for limbs that slice at you if you get too close – I couldn’t help but think of the necromorphs that haunt Dead Space’s corridors when faced with them. But the horrors don’t end there. In fact, they’re hidden around every tight corner and in every open field. This is best exemplified near the end of my demo as I venture far too near a giant shimmering blob of spiking goo and wavy ribbing. It’s a hard thing to try and describe in words, and in turn quite unlike anything else I’ve ever seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So far it all sounds very sci-fi horror, but that’s just one side of Hell is Us’ coin, because the way you deal with these threats is thoroughly medieval fantasy. I quickly discover that standard weapons have no effect on them, but thankfully soon receive a glowing white sword that’s much more effective. Alongside a standard mix of dodging and blocking, you can slice at enemies with both standard and charged heavy attacks. At its core it's a relatively basic melee combat system that I found fairly unforgiving at times (though never unfair,) but more wrinkles do reveal themselves over time. Recovery items are scarce, so you’ll largely be relying on the smart “healing pulse” system, which is triggered by hitting the right bumper button when a burst of particles emerges from an enemy after hitting them. It encourages aggression when playing, and kept me on the front foot when searching for a health top-up, just as some of my favourite action-heavy games like Control and Doom Eternal do.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you can go in all blades blazing, however, as the length of your stamina bar is directly linked to the amount of health you have left. This means you can only get a hit or two in when near death before needing to hang back and rest a moment. Should you find yourself in need of a helping hand, you can call upon your drone companion who, among other abilities, can distract enemies while you sneak up on them for a critical hit. This isn’t necessarily a stealth game, but it’s nice to know the option is there.</p><p>Alongside special attacks, these systems all combine to create a tense dance in each combat encounter that’s a consistent thrill to navigate through, especially when faced with more complex threats. A prime example of such foes are those connected to glowing, pulsating entities that are colour-coded depending on the type of attack they use. For example, the red ones plow into you, whereas the yellow ones attack from range. Deal enough damage to them and they’ll retreat into their fleshier counterparts and make them vulnerable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>During my playtime, I also got my hands on several other weapons, too, such as a very cool pair of twin axes that unleashed flurries of charged attacks, and a hulking polearm that delivered slow but heavy hits. The latter seemed an entirely optional find, too, unlocked by collecting a series of ancient medallions and slotting them into a side door hidden in the catacombs. It’s nice to see the investigation side of the game leading to new treasures and cleverly integrated into these open zone areas, rather than just being there to reveal story information.</p><p>Of course, this combat is what stands between Rémi and him being reunited with his father. That connection will remain lost for the time being, however, as upon arriving in Jova it is revealed that he left town with the global peacekeeping forces. The journey continues and the next stage of the investigation is underway as I wander around speaking to weary, sometimes dismissive, villagers. There’s obviously some deeper mystery at play too, as alien languages and arresting sci-fi gothic architecture lurk underground, waiting to emerge and reveal their secrets. It’s worth noting that Hell is Us is striking throughout, no coincidence when you consider Jacques-Belletête was an art director of both Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided - two games that have stood the test of time incredibly well from a stylistic perspective.</p><p>It’s this willingness to just get a bit weird that makes me so encouraged by what I’ve played of Hell is Us. Its 90s setting and appropriate lack of modern technology is not only a vehicle to encourage genuine exploration, but also feels like a throwback to a decade where games held your hand a little more loosely. I, for one, welcome it, and look forward to seeing where Hell is Us leads me to next.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy is also up for wallowing in bleakness.

                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 were instant hits in the later days of the PlayStation 1, with Pro Skater 3 becoming an even bigger hit on the PlayStation 2 and considered one of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console's best game</a>. It's only been four years since the last Tony Hawk Pro Skater release, and the man himself confirmed on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> that more are on the way.</p><p>"The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was released exactly 25 years ago today," Hawk posted. "My intention and expectation for the game was mostly for the enjoyment of skateboarders. I had no idea it would transcend a niche market to become a massive success and--as some have argued--change the course of skateboarding's popularity (and possibly even skate trick evolution)."</p><p>Pro Skater's popularity helped usher in a slew of similar titles for different sports like snowboarding with the SSX series, and professional snowboarder Shaun White led with his own gaming series for the sport as well.</p><p>Hawk's post continued with how the game changed his life and introduced him to a generation of fans outside the normal X-Games crowd.</p><p>"[The game] is a big reason that I get to ride my skateboard for a living to this very day. And most of the featured characters are still out there ripping and representing skateboarding’s diversity in the best ways possible."</p><p>In the post, Hawk had some footage of him performing moves for the mocap for the game in the development phase. "I poured myself into every aspect of this project because I believed we were creating something exceptional, and I am immensely proud of the series that followed…and their soundtracks," he added. "Thanks to Activision, Neversoft (RIP) and all of you that played THPS in those formative years. I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p><p>In 2020, Pro Skater 1 and 2 were remade with modern graphics and released as a single game, making it the first major console game in the series since 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. In addition to the Pro Skater games, the series also included other skateboarding titles like Underground, Shred, Ride, American Wasteland, Project 8, Motion, and Downhill Jam.</p><p>After Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 release, there was reportedly a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">second remake in the works</a> for Pro Skater 3 and 4 from developer Vicarious Visions. These plans were nixed in favor of the developer working as a Call of Duty support studio.

			<p>The new DLC for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, Mask of Darkness, is pure evil. Sadistic even. Without doubt it has proven to be one of the most challenging, most arduous, most masochistic video game experiences of my life. Thrilling in places, deeply frustrating in others, I certainly didn’t enjoy every moment of it, but what I can say is that I survived it and was immensely satisfied in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - Mask of Darkness |DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVZirQWSlD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For all those who didn’t find the brilliant Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown challenging enough – what is wrong with you? That last boss almost broke me – then the Mask of Darkness DLC is undoubtedly for you. Accessible from a few hours into the main game, this DLC takes the form of an optional side quest. Sargon is tasked with hunting down the mysterious masked Immortal Radjen. Unfortunately, our hapless hero is tricked and ends up trapped in Radjen’s mind palace, an entirely separate map, cut off from the labyrinthian environment of Mount Qaf that we have all grown so familiar with.</p>


<p>The player is immediately stripped of the majority of Sargon’s abilities and health boosts. Essentially, you end up with the bog-standard vanilla version of the protagonist. Two exceptions remain: a dash and the teleport. It took some time to adjust to not having a double jump anymore; Sargon plunging to his death on more occasions than I care to recount due to my muscle memory kicking in. On the plus side, entirely new amulets can be found and returned with to the main game. One notable example, with which your Chakram is turned into a vampire, absorbing health from enemies to return to the player, is an unbelievably handy addition.</p>


<p>With Sargon thoroughly debuffed, what follows is one of the most brutal, yet finely honed, platforming challenges I’ve ever encountered. From the first stretch, where Sargon is chased by a giant evil eye that will instant kill him on contact, this DLC is clearly a very different beast from the original game. You should prepare to die. A lot. The precision platforming required can often feel overwhelming, yet, due to the thorough and immaculate design work, there is always a way through. A way that often surprises you with its ease to implement once you see it. Yet, before that, there is a lot of trial and error – particularly when it comes to those irritating platforms that only disappear after you leave their surface – and that certainly won’t be to everyone’s taste.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, Radjen’s mind palace stands out from the varied biomes of Mount Qaf. This is a far darker, eminently sinister, environment. One with huge symbiote-like tendrils infecting it, twisting and suffocating each vast landscape you encounter. There are some new baddies to bash, of course. Most enjoyable are the mechanical spinning blade drones that you can deflect into the unsuspecting faces of other foes, most satisfying indeed.<br>
</p>
<p>There are also supposedly four bosses to be killed by, though that number is rather disingenuous, as one of the four is little more than a powered-up regular warrior with a life bar. Radjen though, proves to offer a phenomenal, if disparagingly difficult, final challenge. One which will test your reflexes like nothing else in the main game. You also unlock a further boss battle upon completion of the mind Palace. Suffice to say it’s a great ultimate smackdown against an old mentor.</p>
<p>Despite the hugely difficult challenge that Mark of Darkness offers, it is entirely doable thanks to Ubisoft’s generous suite of accessibility options. Nearly ever facet of the game can be tinkered with. From being able to summon portals to instantly navigate nasty platforming sections or by reducing enemy attack damage to virtually nothing. So effective are these gameplay easers, that even this aged and slightly inept gamer was able to see things through to completion.</p>
<p>For under a fiver and with around five to six hours of content, the Mask of Darkness is practically an essential addition for fans of The Lost Crown. Offering an intense experience; as well as a surprisingly compelling story that fills in many of the blanks from the original game. Recommended.</p>

			<p>505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni have announced that Assetto Corsa EVO will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Early Access</a> as of January 16, 2025. This game is the latest evolution in the iconic Assetto Corsa series and is said to represent a major leap forward in the universe by offering a "significantly enriched sim-racing experience."&nbsp; Much like previous games in the franchise, Assetto Corsa EVO will include cars from different classes, showcasing years of motoring history. These cars will include road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars.</p>
<p>Using KUNOS Simulazioni's new proprietary engine, the feeling of driving these cars in-game will be able to more accurately simulate the mechanical, electronic and aerodynamic feel of driving a car at high speeds, helping to provide a new sense of realism to the franchise.</p>
<p>This game in particular will be supporting a full 24-hr race cycle, with new cutting-edge lighting, dynamic weather, track conditions and photorealistic visuals, which are all boosted using the new engine created by KUNOS.</p>
<p>"We know you've been eagerly awaiting news on Assetto Corsa EVO launch and trust us<em> —&nbsp;</em>we've been working hard to make sure everything meets our high standards. Here at KUNOS, we believe in taking the time to get things just right, and that's why the Early Access for Assetto Corsa EVO will officially begin on January 16, 2025," said Marco Massarutto, KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder and Executive Manager.</p>
<p>To support the news of Assetto Corsa EVO's Early Access launch, the developers released a new trailer, which features in-game footage for the first time. The trailer is just under two minutes long, and it credits companies such as Porsche, Alfa Romeo, Rseat, and Bell Helmets in the description, as they are partnered up with KUNOS Simulazioni to be able to create Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there is no price given for how much Assetto Corsa EVO will cost when it launches, but based off of previous launches of games in the Assetto Corsa franchise, it's expected it'll be around the 40 to 50 dollar mark, but that could be subject to change, especially once the game leaves Early Access. It isn't stated how long they are planning on the game being in Early Access, but hopefully, the feedback during that time will be beneficial in giving players the best sim-racing experience.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a sale on the<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-added-to-assetto-corsa-thanks-to-csp-mod/"> Assetto Corsa</a> games across multiple platforms, including all of the DLCs for the games. Assetto Corsa Competizione, the most recent game to be released on Steam in the franchise is currently available for $11.99, which is a huge 70% discount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sabotage Studio has announced the release date for the upcoming free&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>Dawn of Equinox update, which is bringing three-player local co-op, new combat systems, and more.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the update, which lands on November 12th across all platforms, is distinct from the game's upcoming free&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>DLC, which we got to learn about during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct shows</a>.</p>
<p>Like that DLC, however, this update is completely free. The first major feature it's bringing is local three-player co-op, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-darling-rpg-sea-of-stars-achieves-5-million-players-couch-co-op-revealed">first revealed for the game back in March</a> (when we also learned&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>had hit the five million player count).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-combat.jpg?itok=x3knLc99 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-combat.jpg?itok=y2SR2Oed 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>will soon support three-player co-op.</figcaption></figure><p>The new multiplayer mode will not only let you traverse the world with your friends, but will also introduce a new Co-op Timed Hits mechanic, which will need you and your friends to be on your toes in combat.</p>
<p>As well as multiplayer, you're also getting new Mystery Locks in combat, which will need to be revealed in order to figure out which abilities you should use against certain foes. Combo Points will no longer be lost after battle, either, allowing you to experiment with new ways to approach different encounters.</p>
<p><em>Sea of Stars</em>' prologue has been revamped as well; it no longer plays out in flashback, instead opening directly on the heroes' childhood in order to get you into the action more quickly.</p>
<p>A number of other new features have also been included as part of the Dawn of Equinox update, including new difficulty presets, improvements to the Parrot relic, and a bonus cinematic to "accentuate a pivotal moment in the original adventure".</p>

<p><em>Sea of Stars</em>' Dawn of Equinox update arrives ahead of&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em>, a free DLC intended for release in 2025. Said DLC will add a new playable character, a new storyline, and more, and is intended to serve as an "encore" to the original game.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244090/Sea_of_Stars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sea-of-stars/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sea-of-stars/9NLLTTJZH40L" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sea-of-stars-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>The long-running chief of the Tekken series, Katsuhiro Harada, once tried to convince KFC to let him use Colonel Sanders as a character in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a>, according to an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/">TheGamer</a>. "[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."</p>
<p>Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>.</p>

<h2>Gritty</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tekken-8-kfc-mascots-list-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>The wide-eyed mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3TENrrlOyw">no stranger to violence</a>. He is agile, powerful, and fully media trained. There really is no reason why this could not happen.</p>
<h2>Mr Muscle</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tekken-8-kfc-mascots-list-2-mr-muscle.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>Ah, but which incarnation of the bleach-but-not-blond hero would best fit the Tekken mould? The modern CGI gym bro in orange spandex is the obvious choice, since it fits in with the game's narrow range of body types. But the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tquSbZEP-g">boxer-wearing beanpole of the 1990s</a> may offer variety. Yes, the Mr Muscle of today is a reboot. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe but for toilet cleaner.  </p>
<h2>The Annoying Singer From The Go Compare Ads</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tekken-8-kfc-mascots-list-3-go-compare.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>In lieu of oversized biffer Bob, this may be a good fit. He is appropriately zany, kooky, <em>and</em> wacky. He can sing his jingle at the start and end of every fight, earning Bandai Namco literally dozens of British pounds in advertising revenue. What's not to like?</p>
<h2>The Monopoly Man</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tekken-8-kfc-mascots-list-3-monopoly.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>God, I'd love to punch him.

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bel Group</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Her laugh will make an excellent mid-game taunt, and her fondness for showing off her earrings (cheese) puts her firmly into the Tekken developer's archetypal realm of "women wot punch and like fashion". Her bovine body may prove a challenge. But this is a series that has had a bear, a dinosaur, a kangaroo, and another, smaller dinosaur. I'm sure they can manage. </p>
<h2>Clippy</h2>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Conagra Brands</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lots of room for puns in the post-game gloat with this guy. "I'm going to batter you!" or "I can weather any wave-dash!" or "King of the Iron <em>Fish</em> Tournament? That's me!" He could have a farcical side story with Kuma, all about the Captain's salmon stock going missing. Oh, Kuma! You big silly, greedy bear.</p>
<h2>The Andrex Puppy</h2>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kimberly-Clark</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A literal underdog, the Andrex Puppy would need to be redesigned from the ground up to be viable in the meta. A ranged attack where he throws endless rolls of shit tickets at opponents. Several powerful unblockable charge attacks. This is all surely achievable from a legal and corporate perspective. Surely. </p>
<h2>Quaker Oats Guy</h2>
<figure>

<p>Look at him. Look at all that repressed rage. He is not coming out of the ring until you are fully dead. </p>
<h2>Julius Pringles</h2>

<p>Hang on a minute... Julius!? This guy has a name and it is <em>Julius</em>? Also, hey! This is just the Monopoly man's younger brother! That family's got their fingers in everything. Disgusting. Another condemnation of capitalism's salty, powdery excess. I'm done with this stupid list.</p>

            <p>If the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> left you - haha, wait for it, ah this is going to be great, I'm <em>so</em> pleased with myself - cold (!!!!) then why not run your eye over fellow city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/technotopia">Technotopia</a>. Developed by Yustas and published by Wall World and Beholder outfit Alawar, it casts you as an AI mayor, Iris, who is trying to create the perfect city in a world of social and economic calamity. A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Iris is both helped and hindered in this endeavour by four human factions - "capitalists, aristocrats, politicians, and the common people". I hail from the UK, where aristocrats tend also to be capitalists and politicians, so I'm tempted to reword this as "the common people, plus a bunch of grasping, untrustworthy bastards". Technotopia is out 16th October, and I've got a trailer full of soothing background music for you, below.</p>

<p>You'll sculpt your metropolis by means of playing cards, using them to grow skyscrapers, parks, residential districts and transport highways from spectral, unfurnished map tiles. The presentation here reminds me slightly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries Of Titan</a>, though it doesn't look like you can tunnel inside buildings to rearrange the fittings.</p>
<p>While dealing from and upgrading your deck, you'll manage sets of coloured resources and field dialogue requests from faction members and other characters - these include "hackers, oligarchs, criminals and inventors". Some of the problems you'll face appear systemic in nature, while others are story beats triggered by certain conditions. Here's a rundown of the features, lifted from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825110/Technotopia/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>    • 4 faction-driven questlines: Each with its own unique story, shaping the city's destiny.</p>
<p>    • 100+ unique buildings: Each structure offers distinct bonuses, influencing the balance of power within the city.</p>
<p>    • 4 building combinations: Discover new ways to strategically combine city blocks for maximum impact. </p>
<p>    • 50+ dynamic events: Every event is influenced by your decisions, with outcomes that ripple throughout the city. </p>
<p>    • Factions' influence: Every choice you make shifts the power dynamics, affecting how events unfold and who controls the city.</p>
<p>    • Criminal activity: As crime levels rise, new challenges and unique events appear, forcing you to make tough, high-stakes choices. </p>
<p>    • City news: Stay informed on how your actions are shaping the city and its people in real time. </p>
<p>    • Memory cubes: Scattered across the city, collecting these will unlock bonuses and insights that aid your journey.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I must confess, when I first saw this I had it confused with Arcen Games's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/">Heart Of The Machine</a>, a turn-based sci-fi 4X published by the always-dependable Hooded Horse. It has broadly the same premise, but is a lot more complex and fiddly, with the option to *squints* "unleash a pack of genetically modified velociraptors upon the rich". Yeah, I'm pretty sure Frostpunk 2 doesn't have that either. I guess we'll post about Heart Of The Machine too at some stage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-aew-%E2%80%9Cstrongly-considering%E2%80%9D-new-partner-for-future-video-games.996423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/aew-strongly-considering-new-partner-for-future-video-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The future of AEW video games currently hangs in the balance.</p>



<p>Multiple sources have told me that the decision makers at AEW are “strongly considering” finding a new development partner moving forward. This comes after numerous issues surrounding the game’s development.</p>



<p>“They [AEW] knows that things didn’t go the way they expected,” one source said. “The game was over-budget and it under delivered when it came out. It has AEW strongly considering moving to a new developer for their games.”</p>



<p>AEW Fight Forever launched in June 2023 to mixed response. While the gameplay was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/aew-fight-forever-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fun and easy to pick up</a>, the lack of depth and various bugs was a turnoff for many players. In April 2024, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/aew-fight-forever-delayed-further-budget-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was told that there was pressure</a> on the developers to “deliver something faster than what it should’ve been”.</p>



<p>Now, AEW is trying to figure out where to go with their games. The original contract with Yuke’s called for one year of post launch updates which came in the form of four season passes that added wrestlers, moves, game modes, and venues. The last DLC pack game out in July, adding Jay White to the roster. There have been talks for releasing recently signed wrestlers Will Ospreay, Kazuchika Okada, and Mercedes Mone to the game’s roster, but it’s unclear where those talks between AEW and Yuke’s stand.</p>



<p>The sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity say that the primary focus is around the gaming future as a whole. </p>



<p>“Everything is on the table,” Insider Gaming was told. “There were some positives with the Yuke’s relationship, and some feel that with a foundation in place, another game could make things better rather than giving up after one attempt. But you can’t argue that there are concerns with how things went in the final year of the game’s development.” </p>



<h2 id="h-issues-from-the-start">Issues From The Start</h2>



<p>Issues with Yuke’s and AEW date back to before Fight Forever was released. There was a lot of <a href="https://www.sportsgamersonline.com/games/aew-yukes-butting-heads-over-aew-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">butting heads between</a> both sides, including involving AEW executive vice president Kenny Omega. At one point, I was told Omega was frustrated to the point of “hating” working with Yuke’s while others felt that Yuke’s was trying to “take advantage” of Omega due to his inexperience around helping with game development. </p>



<p>“No one was really happy when the game came out,” a source said. “Even before launch, internal talks started about whether to continue with the game with Yuke’s, bring it over to a new developer and either build on what’s been done or start from scratch, or leave the console market and continue to focus on mobile.</p>



<p>“A lot of people in the company want another shot with a console game, but it only matters if the one signing the checks wants to trust them again.”</p>



<p>When asked where that sits, I was told, “No one knows.”</p>



<p>AEW owns the engine used for Fight Forever, and can bring it over to a new developer if they wanted to build on top of what was made. It’s unlikely that, after Fight Forever went well over budget and didn’t turn a profit, the company would look to have another game built from scratch. But that comes down to the kind of deal made with a new partner.</p>



<p>It’s important to clarify that these are currently in the discussions stage. No final decision has been made by AEW regarding a new partner or if there will even be a new game any time soon. </p>



<p>“There are feelers out to some of the larger developers in the space, including some obvious ones, to see what the interest in wrestling games are,” it was said. “They are doing their due diligence before any decision is made.”</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for AEW video games? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/621/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

"So, I asked to use Colonel Sanders and go to the head office in Japan."</p><p>Unfortunately, Harada’s pitch was turned down with a "bad look.” Since then, Colonel Sanders actually did appear in a video game: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/i-love-you-colonel-sanders-a-finger-lickin-good-dating-simulator">I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin' Good Dating Simulator</a>, a dating sim commissioned by KFC and released for free on Steam on September 24, 2019 as a bizarre promo for the fast food chain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"[Harada] went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and tried to get Colonel Sanders," game designer Michael Murray added. "They weren't very open to the idea.</p><p>"[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them. But it just goes to show how difficult these types of discussions are."</p><p>So, no Colonel Sanders. But what about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">that Waffle House stage Tekken fans are desperate for</a>? "It's not something that we can accomplish on our own," Harada said, pointing to the need for Waffle House’s unlikely approval for such a DLC.</p><p>Still, Tekken 8 fans do have the game’s third DLC character, Heihachi Mishima, to look forward to. The once-dead fighting veteran joins the roster as part of the upcoming free story expansion for Tekken 8, titled <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-unforgotten-echoes-and-heihachi-mishima-hands-on-impressions">Unforgotten Echoes</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It seems this dispute was at the heart of the end of those Netflix adaptations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Blizzard fans are now expressing their disappointment at what might have been, particularly for Overwatch, which seems tailor-made for an animated spin-off. Indeed the hero shooter has a number of impressive animated shorts already that flesh out its iconic characters’ backstories. Imagine that on a bigger scale for Netflix.</p><p>Then there’s StarCraft, whose cutscenes and promos are some of the best in the business. A StarCraft adaptation might have been truly special.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One Blizzard franchise conscious by its absence from Schreier’s list is Warcraft, which had an ill-fated CGI-heavy movie of its own back in 2016. That movie, while at one point the highest grossing video game film of all time, did not enjoy enough success to spawn a sequel.</p><p>Other revelations from Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment include yet another <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">StarCraft shooter</a> being in development, and that Blizzard staff unsuccessfully pitched WarCraft 4 and even a Call of Duty real-time strategy game.</p><p>Blizzard is currently preparing to release Diablo 4 expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a>, and has ongoing support for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> and all-conquering MMO <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starcraft-remastered-and-starcraft-2-campaign-collection-confirmed-for-game-pass">StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection hit Game Pass in November</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    <p><span>There is more on the moon than you've been told...</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Interstellar <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,537 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,793 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > Moon Mystery" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon-mystery">Moon Mystery</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,369 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1933840/Moon_Mystery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on October 28, publisher <a title="Companies > indie.io [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/indieio">indie.io</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Cosmoscouts" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cosmoscouts">Cosmoscouts</a> announced. <span id="more-918706"></span></p><p>“<em>Moon Mystery</em> is the kind of game we always wanted to play,” said Cosmoscouts founder and lead game designer Mikolaj Szymanowski in a press release. “A single-player, story-centric adventure game with unique puzzles—how do you move in zero gravity with no thrusters, but a gun in your hand?—and interactive scenes players have never experienced before. Have you ever fallen into a black hole?”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via indie.io:</p><blockquote><p>Players will step into the space suit of an astronaut on the Silver Globe, embarking on an epic interstellar first-person shooter adventure when it turns out that there is more on the Moon than just rocks and resources. </p><p><em>Moon Mystery</em> starts at humanity’s crowning achievement, a research outpost on the surface of the Moon, and the first step towards traveling across the Solar System and further among the stars, realizing humanity’s age-old ambition. Players step into the high-tech suit of an astro-geologist researching exotic materials on the Moon’s surface that could make this dream a reality, assisted by TOBY (Technical-Overseer-Bionically-Improved). The adventure starts when something goes terribly wrong and all contact with Earth is lost.</p><p>Stranded on the lunar surface, players will have to use their wits to survive the most hostile environment visited by human beings, crossing vast landscapes and exploring abandoned facilities left behind by previous missions to the Moon. But merely surviving and exploring will not be enough: Soon, the adventure will take them across vast interstellar spaces, where no man has gone before. Players will face technology gone rogue, master controllable vehicles from tiny RC cars to spaceships and even submarines, and adapt to evolving environments. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Moon Mystery</em> starts on the silver globe, but will end far away from humanity’s home. Each new environment offers new challenges: New vehicles to master, new enemies to overcome, and of course, ever-evolving environmental puzzles and platforming sequences that will require the players to constantly adapt to new twists and turns in the experience.</p><p>Cosmoscouts is an independent Polish studio headquartered in Warsaw, founded to bring <em>Moon Mystery</em> to the players. What originated as one man’s after-hours hobby in 2022 blossomed into a full-size game with a small, but passionate group of developers creating the kind of adventure they always wanted to play. This passion was recognized on Kickstarter, where it was featured as a Project [Kickstarter] Loves and exceeded its initial funding goal.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Moon Mystery - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySbkiIjxLRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The next project from the Horizon studio Guerrilla Games is reportedly an online game, and the third single-player entry in the series is still a while away.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/R0A0ZEJ8dYE?si=38Xf2P_h_w9gEoUj&amp;t=3323" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spawn Wave podcast</a>, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier said, "Horizon Online is [Guerrilla's] next project, not whatever the third single-player game looks like. So that one might be a ways off." Schreier also said that PlayStation's live-service initiative was "no joke" and that this Horizon online project is one of the few ones that hasn't been already canceled or flopped like Concord did.</p><p>Sony is leaning into the Horizon franchise heavily with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-get-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-for-20-if-youre-a-new-player/1100-6526779/" data-ref-id="1100-6526779">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-631814">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>. The former adds visual fidelity on par with the PS5's capabilities as well as accessibility options. The latter is a family-friendly version of the game with an emphasis on co-op. It's also the first PlayStation Studios game to get a release on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>Sony's live-service initiative has been a mixed bag so far.

<p>In addition to Dawn of Equinox, Sabotage Studio has a Sea of Stars DLC in the pipeline. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Throes of the Watchmaker</a>, as it's known, will be released across all platforms in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>"Throes of the Watchmaker will find Sea of Stars' leading heroes Valere and Zale venturing into a magical miniature clockwork world threatened by a cursed carnival, which forces the Solstice Warriors to adapt to unfamiliar rules to fully master their Sun and Moon powers," the DLC's official blurb reads.</p>

		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is going to get an early access release KUNOS Simulazioni and 505 Games has announced, but it will just be missing out a 2024 release window. Instead, Assetto Corsa EVO will be available on Steam Early Access from January 16th, 2025, and you can wishlist it right now by going clicking on the link, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/">Assetto Corsa EVO on Steam</a>. An announcement trailer for the game has also been released.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/assetto-corsa-evo-aims-to-redefine/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> was actually revealed back in June, with KUNOS Simulazioni confirming that it would be moving to a similar format to the original Assetto Corsa.</p>
<p><em>“We know you’ve been eagerly awaiting news on&nbsp;Assetto Corsa EVOlaunch, and trust us —we’ve been working hard to make sure everything meets our high standards. Here at KUNOS, we believe in taking the time to get things just right, and that’s why the Early Access for Assetto Corsa EVO will officially begin on January 16, 2025.”</em> said Marco Massarutto, KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder and Executive Manager.<em>&nbsp;“Our goal is to ensure the quality that all sim racing enthusiasts rightfully expect from a title like Assetto Corsa EVO. We would like to express our sincere gratitude for the continuous and extraordinary support received from our community. We look&nbsp; forward to sharing more exciting news on the project soon!”</em></p>
<p>The game will include cars from multiple classes and so will include road cars, classics, hypercars, prototypes and racing cars. The game will also feature 24 hour cycles with dynamic weather which will impact track conditions and car performance. Assetto Corsa EVO will also be created in new proprietary engine that will allow for photorealistic graphics. From the original announcement, some of the tracks that were seen included &nbsp;Imola, Nurburgring Nordschleife and Brands Hatch. The cars that were spotted included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAm</li>
<li>Alpine A110</li>
<li>Alpine A290_β</li>
<li>Hyundai N Vision 74</li>

<p>In our Assetto Corsa Competizione review, Stefan said, “Where the original console release of Assetto Corsa Competizione had some huge caveats hanging over it, the game’s release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S brings it up to spec, effectively matching the PC version. It still has some weaknesses in presentation and structure for new players in particular, but once you get into the groove, it’s one of the best sim racers you can buy right now.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-release-date-revealed-for-november.996363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date, and the latest installment of the management sim series is hitting PC and consoles in November.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-launching-november-26" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will arrive first on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 on November 26th, and that a mobile version of the game, namely&nbsp;<em>FM25 Mobile</em>, will arrive via Netflix Games on the same day.</p>
<p><em>FM25 Touch</em>, a version of the game for the Nintendo Switch, will then follow on December 3rd, and Sports Interactive and Sega say they'll reveal more information about&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>Touch "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-release-date-players.jpg?itok=0Tq6ZarL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-release-date-players.jpg?itok=qsG-RgfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will feature a fully-licensed Premier League for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>As has been previously revealed,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will be the first game in the series to feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">full licensing for the Premier League</a>, so you won't need to spend hours editing your favorite teams anymore.</p>
<p>It's also making a switch to the Unity engine, which Sports Interactive says will power "the new era for football management", creating "a deeper, more authentic football universe". I'll be using "football" rather than "soccer" here, by the way. Blame my Britishness.</p>
<p>However, this newest installment will also lack the Create-a-Club feature, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">several other core franchise features</a>, including Touchline Shouts and the Data Chalkboard.</p>
<p>A number of new features will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>, however, including the debut of women's football, overhauled tactics, and "a complete revamp of the way to set up your manager", which Sports Interactive says will lead to "more customized, unique stories".</p>

<p>In the weeks between now and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>'s release, Sega and Sports Interactive will be <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/roadmap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drip-feeding new information</a> about the game, including info about key features, new additions, and more.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will appear seem a little confusing. On its <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/buy-fm25?game=fm25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order page</a>, the game appears to be available for "Xbox", which seemingly includes Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, its <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/games/football-manager-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> simply shows images of the Xbox Series X and the PS5 under the console heading, so if you're looking to play the game on Xbox One, you may want to hold off pre-ordering. It's definitely not coming to PS4, though. Sorry, PS4 players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is returning for its third season on Amazon Prime. Ahead of its release TechRaptor, along with a number of other outlets, had a chance to sit down and ask the core cast of Critical Role about the experience of revisiting Vox Machina once more and the task of adapting the campaign further into the TV show.</p>
<p><strong>While there are no direct spoilers a number of features about Season 3 are teased related to locations and plot, if you want to go into this season completely blind then be sure to bookmark this article and return once <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> S3 has completely released by October 24th.</strong></p>
<h2>What Fans of<em> The Legend of Vox Machina</em> S3 Can Look Forward To</h2>
<p>To begin Matthew Mercer, CCO and Dungeon Master at Critical Role, took a moment to explain the premise of the upcoming third season. "Vox Machina are still rallying against the Chroma Conclave, they managed to fell one of their numbers but others exist. There's a possible dubious conversation with one of them, there's all sorts of weird mingled stuff there, but as the search for these Vestigaes continues, part of it leads them to hell."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell.jpg?itok=-_97dQpi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell.jpg?itok=yQWOpiW- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking further about Vox Machina's travels to hell Mercer expanded, "It was part of the campaign to a degree and we've been able to expand upon that in some really fun and unique and surprising ways. We've gotten to spotlight some of the non-Vox Machina characters and spend more time with them."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For those not familiar with the campaign there will be a lot of really cool familiar moments and some very unique and surprising ones" - Matthew Mercer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excited for what fans, new and old, are going to see, Liam O'Brien talked a bit about the anticipation that the cast is feeling. "There are massive moments that are going to sideswipe the audience and we're just waiting in the wings for it to slide onto stage," he gestured with his hands, something coming into frame. "You're not going to be disappointed."</p>
<p>A bit of a more direct tease, Taliesin Jaffe jumped in to say "I'm excited for the cleverest thing for Laura Bailey has said in Campaign One and that's all I'm going to say." As I, and I'm sure others in the room, began scrambling through their memories of what he could be referencing Sam Riegal asked "Is it a poop joke?", Jaffe quickly swatted away that idea. While we still can't be too sure what moment Jaffe was thinking of we at least know it's not that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy.jpg?itok=kzNX0a3M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy.jpg?itok=r87-s7PT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Lot Of The Same, But Also New</h2>
<p>Talking deeper about the changes that some fans of the original campaign may recognize, Willingham explained that "Season Three is a big divergence for our characters. I think part of it, as we were considering story beats and how we want the show to approach this culmination with the Chroma Conclave we're always looking for ways to improve or economize, or even put a new shine on some moments now that we have a second chance at telling them, but we're also trying to tee things up for down the road, not just in this show but also in the Mighty Nein. We've had years and years of gameplay since these episodes were played the very first time and so we're always trying to go back and seed things early if we can and provide something new for an audience that thinks they know what to expect, we can unsettle them just a bit."</p>
<p>When asking the cast who felt they had the largest divergence Marisha Ray volunteered Johnson's character Pike Trickfoot. "We definitely did a lot of adjusting to Pike and I think that continues throughout the rest of the shows." During the original campaign due to scheduling conflicts with Johnson's work on Blindspot Pike would frequently come in and out of story arcs.</p>

<p>"I know personally I'm so excited to just retroactively have more Ashley Johnson" - Marisha Ray</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnson talked about how she was excited that there are so many moment now "specifically with Pike. Getting to see where we could have gone with the story had I been at the table. Also where we are going with the story in the animated series and how Pike can sort of fit in there. We looked for ways in a series with hundreds of hours that we have to truncate into an episode or 12 episodes and it feels really cool because I feel like I get to do things I really didn't get to do at the table and to get to go to places. I get to go to hell which is going to be really fun."</p>

<p>"I think that the character we got to alter the most is Vox Machina as a group," Riegel began "from the campaign to the screen we go to different places in different orders, we split up in different ways that we didn't do in the campaign, we reunite in different ways and so really the whole linear arc of the season differs from the campaign a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Also characters that aren't main Vox Machina characters like Kima and Allura, we focus on them in ways this season that they never got that spotlight in the campaign and it's really fun to look at these characters, beloved characters, that didn't get their own campaign episode but now they get their own episode in the animated series."</p>
<h2>Recording Trials, Tribulations, and Tomfoolery From A Decade Ago</h2>
<p>"We get to pick and choose where we want to go and the moments we get to highlight," Jaffe began to explain on the topic of time in the recording booth. He highlighted just how different the situation was when they were roleplaying at a table making decisions on the fly and with the show they're able to revisit every moment and dial it up for drama.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's really amazing to be able to give these moments to artists and then just watch it blossom"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the experience in the booth, reliving emotions from years ago Ray jumped into the discussion "I think at the table too, when we're in these moments all of these emotions are real. We're acting in real-time so going back and revisiting them it's still just as emotionally impactful and it is not uncommon to cry… a lot… and then you're exhausted for the rest of the day because you cried in your morning session. It's still so emotionally palpable ten years later almost."</p>
<p>Bailey remarked that she believes that when they were playing this game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons a decade ago they didn't realize just how much emotion they could bring to the story. "We were a little timid about fully going there emotionally, it's so wonderful in the animated series to allow ourselves to dive in to those really deep moments."</p>
<p>As each cast member became quite introspective of the emotions that each of their characters had gone through and the effort it took to portray that O'Brien also highlighted the time in the recording booth that they were able to spend together. "We have so many responsibilities too, we're organizing so much and tracking so much and writing and producing, the time we get together with a ring of microphones and we get to make each other laugh and cry is a playspace, a place of dream and imagination. I'm so excited the mornings I get to wake up and we're heading off to the studios, I don't ever want it to end, I love being in the Holodeck."</p>

<p>What you see on the screen of Season 3 continues to push the envelope in terms of adult animation. Speaking on their collaboration with Titmouse – whose work includes not only <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, but also Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Boys Presents: Diabolical – Willingham made sure to point out all of the incredible work being done.</p>
<p>"We have amazing partners with Titmouse Animation and it's been important to us form the beginning to really push what this Adult animated show can be so we have incredible episodic directors, board artists, supervising producers that come in and help us push the envelope at every turn. Even when we think we write something that's un-producable or un-animatable they kinda look back and say 'bet' and just blow us away."</p>

<p>The cast burst into laughter making jokes about how without the ToS there would have been constant 30 minute romance scenes.</p>
<p>"I think it was heavily implied that Vex and Percy were doing so much boning." Ray continued "So now we just get to show it!"</p>
<p>Talking more about the core of the relationships, and a bit further away from the boning Jaffe brought up that he and Bailey had talked about their character's relationships at the time and were proud because "it's rare in television to see what feels like a real relationship and this is something I'm really proud of in what we're doing. These feel, at least to me, a lot more honest in the sorts of things that people talk about and deal with in especially stressful relationships."</p>
<h2>The Music Of <em>Vox Machina</em></h2>
<p>From music's original tie to <em>Vox Machina</em>, in Scanlan's bardic performances we've seen hit songs like "The Legend of Vox Machina", "Scanlan's Sphinx Song", and "Pull My Beads of Love" come out of each season of the show.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask what the process was like for identifying where a song should be added and what the process was like to create them. Sam Reigel, Scanlan's creator and voice actor, explained "In season 3 we're going to continue what we've done in prior seasons where there are fun songs that help to carry the vibe and there are some important songs that deal with plot and are integral and this season we actually rely on Matt Mercer more to provide us with some vocals this season in two key moments in the Season. One you might not even recognize that it's Matt's voice but it's in a pivotal emotionally gutting moment in the season and Matt sings a song that will, I hope, break your heart and then he gets to sing in character also in a totally different episode so I'm excited. I'm always excited when we get songs from characters that are not me, although I love me I also love these guys and they're so talented."</p>

<p>Mercer added that from his perspective "A lot of it was just playful banter in the writers room about what moments could be musical. The majority of it was Sam and the folks from production…" Mercer trailed off for a moment before doubling back "Mostly Sam and Peter basically coming up with ridiculous ideas of where to fit songs both mid-episode versus end-credit bits."</p>
<h2><em>The Mighty Nein</em> Isn't Too Far Away</h2>
<p>While the conversation mostly focused on <em>Vox Machina</em> the cast of Critical Role wasn't going to get away without a further hint about the upcoming Mighty Nein TV Show, also coming to Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>After releasing an early animatic earlier this year when asked if any more news could be given about it's release Bailey and O'Brien deflected into playful banter between their characters Jester Lavorre and Caleb Widogast about how many dick jokes there will be.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mighty-nein.jpg?itok=SPa34SaF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mighty-nein.jpg?itok=lqkAxryP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Locking in for a more serious answer O'Brien rattled off a few themes for the season including "Spy thriller, grief, thick action, budding love." From that Bailey added that "it's a story from a different perspective, that we didn't get to see in the campaign."</p>
<p>Willingham also added "One of the things we love about <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is that we get to spend so much time with our antagonists, more than maybe what we did during the live stream. One of the things we're looking forward to the most is seeing some of these villains that we will come to learn and to hate, to meet and maybe even love in some cases. As we've teased before we're visiting these characters from more of a session zero perspective which is how they've all started, come together as a group, and what it is that keeps them together. For some of the audience this will be entirely new material. Some things they may have heard of but never seen before. We're really excited to bring that to the screen for the first time."</p>
