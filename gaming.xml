			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most successful games to launch this year. Despite being available on Game Pass from day one, the JRPG developed by Sandfall Interactive has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to sell more than two million units</a>. Considering that its budget was certainly not as large as a regular triple-A game, its success is already guaranteed.</p>
<p>It may even get bigger by adding a new platform like the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with French YouTuber mistermtv</a>, as translated by MP1st, Sandfall Interactive CEO and Game Director Guillaume Broche said that the great sales have changed the perspective, and that the idea was 'interesting'.</p>
<p><em>Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything. So clearly, it’s too early to say, but we’re kind of in a situation where… let’s say there are a lot of opportunities showing up — way too many at once — and we’re figuring out what we’ll go for and what we won’t. But yeah, it’s definitely something that could be interesting.</em></p>
<p>A turn-based JRPG like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could indeed resonate very well with the Nintendo audience, which would get access to a fantastic game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but it's not one of the heaviest titles made with Epic's technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware could likely run it. Whether that means Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive actually make the port remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-enhanced-edition-comes-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has announced STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy - Enhanced Edition, an updated version of the first three STALKER games it previously released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-leaked-will-bring-the-series-to-consoles-in-june/">PS4 and Xbox One,</a> now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC next week on <strong>May 20, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new current-gen version of the remasters includes better lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, upscaled textures and environments, advanced shaders, and cutscenes that have been pre-rendered in 4K to add to the storytelling. For console players, though, the catch to all that is you'll see as much of these upgrades as the graphics mode you pick will allow.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, PS5 Pro, or Xbox Series X consoles, players can select between four graphics modes. Quality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra Performance. The first three are all set at a 4K resolution, with the frame rate caps being the only variable. Quality runs at 4K/30fps, Balanced runs at 4K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 4K/60fps. Ultra Performance sets the resolution down to 2K to reach 120fps.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone — Enhanced Edition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xbox Series S players have Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes to choose from, though none of those modes have any of the three STALKER games running at 4K. Quality mode on Series S runs at 2K/30fps, Balanced runs at 2K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 1080p/60fps.</p>
<p>Obviously, PC players don't have to deal with all of that and can more manually adjust graphical settings based on the hardware they have available to them, but there are still a few improvements PC players can look forward to. Such as the games now being optimized for Steam Deck, and support for cloud saves.</p>
<p>Current-gen console players will also be able to plug in a keyboard and mouse, if they want, with KBM support coming in this new version. GSC Game World has also confirmed that the PS5 and Xbox Series versions will have Mod.io support, so they can enjoy some of the modding fun that is usually only accessible on PC.</p>
<p>The best part about this new Enhanced Edition is that anyone who has already purchased any of the remasters in the STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will get the corresponding enhanced edition for <strong>free</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>release date, with the updated versions of all three classic shooters coming to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</p>

<p>Back in December, it was revealed that the long-awaited next-gen update for&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">would arrive in 2025</a>, and now we have a concrete release date: May 20th.</p>

<p>All three games will receive significant enhancements across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, including visual and performance improvements, gameplay tweaks to bring the games "more in line with current game practices", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=iJEWmIrK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=dESfbHaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>comes to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, GSC Game World has also <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed the PC specs</a> you're going to need if you want to run the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>trilogy, and they're significantly beefed up compared to the original games, as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Running the games at 1440p and 60fps will require a GTX 1070 Ti and a Core i5-6600K or equivalent, while 4K at 60fps will need an RTX 2080 Ti and Core i7-6700K or AMD's version of the same.</p>

<p>On the plus side, if you already happen to own the original three&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games on PC, you will receive the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>enhancements as a free upgrade. It's not just visual updates, either; you're also getting extras like controller support and Steam achievements.</p>

<p>However, it's worth bearing in mind that the new versions of the game won't support mods created for the old versions. Still, these enhanced versions won't be replacing the originals in storefronts, and there's every chance modders will create new mods for the enhanced editions.</p>




<p><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 20th. You can buy all three games separately or together as a bundle, and console players also won't have to pay for the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Surreal first-person medical sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> will be different from its plague-ridden predecessor in a lot of ways. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> you played a roaming surgeon rooting around in bins for sustenance, and this time you play as the Bachelor, a well-fed doctor who diagnoses patients by inspecting their bodies and investigating their homes for signs of disease. But one of the biggest changes regards the open world. You won't freely explore the remote steppe town this time, but instead dander through isolated pockets, with lots of loading screens, map plotting, and fast travel. That's made a few fans grumpy, but developers Ice-Pick Lodge are sticking to their plans, as they've stated in a development update.</p>

<p>You'll know how town traversal works if you've played the demo for this sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=7802587">Pathologic 3: Quarantine</a> (or if you've read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">our hands-on impressions</a> of the demo). Basically, you walk through particular archways and get confronted with a map screen. From here, you select a route and watch as your little dot makes its way through the city. In certain dangerous neighbourhoods, you're kicked out of this map screen and forced to make your way through the streets in the usual first-person mode once more, a handy revolver at your side to keep desperate muggers at bay. Once you get clear of that zone and find the exit arch, it's back to the map screen. </p>
<p>This is obviously very different from the freestyle wandering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> and its recent spiritual successor Pathologic 2. Enough players of the demo left negative or skeptical feedback about it to prompt Ice-Pick Lodge to respond with a post that explains their reasoning.  </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / HypeTrain Digital</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"The main question after Quarantine: what’s up with the city?" said the devs in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3389330/view/521964845255362377">the post on Steam</a>. "Why couldn’t you move through it without loading screens? And how will that change in the full game? Why change a game where everything 'worked'?</p>
<p>"We know some players would’ve liked that just fine. But for us that wouldn’t be enough. Not creatively (there’s already a game about digging through Gorkhon’s trash cans), and not commercially: sequels to indie games statistically sell much worse than the originals, and we’re making a sequel to a sequel. Just repeating ourselves? That’s a dead end.</p>
<p>"But trying new things is in the studio’s DNA. And that led us to the idea of a new kind of game — about a person lost in time, with narrative structure and space-time torn to shreds. That presentation will stay. It’s a core part of the concept — it can’t be changed. (And technically, it can’t be reversed at this point.)"</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / HypeTrain Digital</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Essentially, they didn't want to simply make the same game again, and it'd be too much work to change direction now from a technical perspective. The studio also asked players of the prologue to remember it was just a demo, and that this railroaded tutorialised journey was only a "parade alley". The street-stalking segments will have more to them, they promise. For example, the player will see the effects of decrees and laws they make during the quarantine at street level. Ordering everyone to wash regularly will mean you really see some NPCs washing their hands as you pass by.  </p>
<p>Although the studio isn't budging on the splintering of that open world, they are looking into other changes. They admit that the survival meter of the hero's mental state is not well-balanced or well-explained (it's a meter that runs from apathy to mania and must be balanced by slurping drugs). And when it comes to some choppy performance issues, they're "planning for things to get much better". </p>
<p>The demo will be taken down at some point shortly before release, they say, with the team now moving all their attention to the full game. It's due to come out some time this year. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Finnish studio Remedy is best known for its single-player action games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the survival horror of <em>Alan Wake</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">supernatural thriller<em> Control</em></a>. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654718/fbc-firebreak-release-date-remedy-control"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, the developer is going in a different direction. It’s the studio’s first multiplayer release: a three-player co-op shooter set in the universe of <em>Control</em>. But while it won’t have the more traditional cinematic storytelling the studio has become known for, that doesn’t mean Remedy is abandoning its narrative roots. Instead, it is trying to explore them in a new genre. “This game actually has quite a bit of narrative design thinking in it, especially because there is not a lot of room for direct storytelling,” says game director Mike Kayatta.</p><p><em>Firebreak</em> is set a few years after the events of <em>Control</em>, after which a building known as the Oldest House — the NYC headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, a government organization that investigates the supernatural — was sealed off to prevent a deadly force called the Hiss from getting out. But there were still people inside. While many of them were FBC bureaucrats and office workers, <em>Firebreak</em> follows members of the titular emergency unit, who serve as the first responders keeping everyone else (relatively) safe. That means venturing out into the Oldest House to fix machinery, eradicate the Hiss, and investigate other paranormal situations. Also, there are a lot of sticky notes, and you have to shower quite a bit.</p><p>I was able to play through a few missions of <em>Firebreak</em> at Remedy’s offices, and the game feels very different from the studio’s previous work. It’s a first-person shooter that relies heavily on cooperation. In each mission, you and two other players are let loose in the Oldest House to complete specific goals; in one of them, we had to repair the machinery that controlled the building’s ventilation, and in another we had to clear away a growing wave of sticky notes that covered every surface. In some cases, the missions had multiple layers to them. After clearing out the sticky notes, for instance, we eventually fought our way to a gigantic boss monster made of even more stickies.</p><p>In some ways, <em>Firebreak</em> seems like a traditional multiplayer shooter. You can equip different types of guns, toss grenades, and you’re often up against hordes of the Hiss, which behave a lot like swarming zombies. As you progress, you earn currency to put toward upgrading your gear, and you can purchase new skins and sprays like in <em>Fortnite</em>. Each player also has to select a “crisis kit,” which includes both special abilities — like letting you jump high in the air — as well as specific tools. One has a wrench for repairing machines, while another has a hose for putting out fires.</p><p>In my brief experience, the game’s structure necessitated coordination. You can’t just run into the Oldest House, guns blazing, and expect to survive. Over voice chat, my team was constantly yelling directions and warnings at each other, giving a heads up that a fresh wave of Hiss was coming or sending the person with the right tool to repair something. Often, these repairs were life-or-death necessities. Scattered around each level were facilities to refill your ammo or shower (which removes status ailments and also replenishes your health), but they often lacked power, meaning you couldn’t get bullets or health until you got them up and running.</p><p>It was a chaotic mess (in a good way), but as with <em>Control</em>, what struck me most about <em>Firebreak</em> was the world itself. It’s just so delightfully weird, infusing a bland office space with a sinister tone. Office cubicles become cover in shootouts, while those sticky notes are like an invasive species, smothering everything — including you, if you can’t make it to a shower in time. Unlike <em>Control</em>, however, <em>Firebreak</em> is reliant almost entirely on its world to tell the story. There are no cutscenes to watch or audio logs to uncover. Instead, you sort out what’s happening by being in this place, and both listening to the little bits of chatter between characters and observing the state of the Oldest House. Or you can try to suss it out anyways, but I’m still not sure why a giant rubber duck started following me in one level.</p><p>Kayatta likens this storytelling technique to hearing stories from firefighters in the field. “We’re not telling a beginning to end story,” he explains. “A lot of that is because the people inside the game are talking to themselves, and they’re filling that narrative space for us.” The decision was made in part so as not to interrupt a bunch of friends playing together, letting you and your co-op partners fill in the space with your own chatter. But the structure is also designed to help <em>Firebreak</em> work for two audiences simultaneously: <em>Control</em> fans and newcomers.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>“The important thing for us is that if you played <em>Control</em>, you signed up for a single-player, exploration, character- and story-focused experience,” Kayatta says. “It was super important that we didn’t say, ‘Ha ha, curve ball, now you need to go find two friends and play a cooperative game that is a totally different genre from a different perspective.’ That feels terrible. Those people need to be protected so that they can go from <em>Control 1</em> to<em> Control 2</em> and experience the journey that we promised them. And we are absolutely going to make that happen. On the other hand, we also want this to be rewarding and fulfilling for them [if they do play <em>Firebreak</em>].”</p><p>Meanwhile, he says that “then you have what we hope is a large audience who actually has never played <em>Control</em>… we wanted to make sure that they could understand the world and didn’t feel the constant pressure to go back and play <em>Control</em>.” That means a balancing act between having enough narrative to be interesting to new players and feel distinctly Remedy, but without so much direct storytelling that<em> Firebreak</em> becomes required reading for anyone waiting to jump into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg"><em>Control</em>’s sequel</a>. And if you do want to dig further into things like the Hiss or what an Altered Item is, you can always play the original <em>Control</em> or dig into a Wiki (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">or maybe one day watch a movie or show</a>). When it comes to how much you want to dig into <em>Firebreak</em>’s narrative, Kayatta says that they “want it to be up to you.”</p><p>No matter which way you look at it, <em>Firebreak</em> is a big departure for Remedy. It’s a new genre, an expansion into multiplayer, and the studio’s first self-published game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085807/remedy-is-now-in-control">as it attempts to take more ownership of its own franchises</a>. It’s an opportunity to expand in a new direction while still attempting to stay true to what a Remedy game is. “Forever we have had these very controlled single-player experiences, and we will continue to do that,” Kayatta says. “But we ask the question with <em>Firebreak</em>: what is it like to share one of those spaces with your friends?”</p><p><sub>FBC: Firebreak <em>launches June 17th on PC, PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers.</em></sub> <em><sub>It will have<a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1922290737648894263"> a closed technical test starting on May 15th</a>.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wait-is-that-a-kid-in-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Theft Auto series does not feature kids in gameplay. It’s a golden rule for pretty much all video games that let you indiscriminately kill NPCs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating">Look at what happened with The Sims competitor inZoi earlier this year</a>, when players found they were able to run over children (the developer quickly patched it out and called it a bug).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, you can understand why a seemingly innocuous screenshot released for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> that looks like it shows a kid in-game has sparked so much speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The screenshot in question is of the Grassrivers section of GTA 6 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-6/Grassrivers">we’ve got a whole page devoted to the area if you want to know more</a>). If you look closely at the bottom right-hand corner of the image, below, you can make out a few people sitting at an outside table. One of these people looks a lot smaller than the other two, so much so that observers are saying it’s a child.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/14/grassrivers-02-1747219300699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Time to play Where's Waldo? with this GTA 6 screenshot.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This detail was picked up by X / Twitter account TheGTAVerse and their post has since gone viral, picking up over 1.5 million views.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A kid spotted in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAVI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAVI</a> screenshot 👀 <a href="https://t.co/pGjSuNn9yt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pGjSuNn9yt</a></p>— TheGTAVerse (@TheGTAVerse) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGTAVerse/status/1922008313551606253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there is a <em>zero</em> chance that kids will be out and about in the GTA 6 game world, because that would mean you would be able to kill them, and that is a big no-no. GTA games are famous for letting you kill pretty much anyone in all manner of over-the-top ways. From simply beating a poor NPC to death with your bare hands to landing a plane on their head, GTA 6 will no-doubt ramp up the reckless NPC destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So no, this screenshot does not confirm you can kill children in GTA 6. It is a screenshot of GTA 6 over a year away from the game’s release date. It is a snapshot of the game at this moment, and nothing more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is… odd to see what could be a child in a GTA 6 screenshot. If it is indeed a child. While most people do think it is a child, it could be a small adult, or there could be some sort of graphics effect at play here that makes what is an adult look smaller in this situation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of GTA 6 Trailer 2 and Rockstar's accompanying info-dump has sparked all sorts of speculation about what to expect from what is sure to be the biggest video game of all time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-grand-theft-auto-fans-think-liberty-city-is-a-secret-location-in-gta-6">Some GTA fans even think Liberty  City may end up in GTA 6 either at launch or as post-launch DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">all the details we’ve discovered so far</a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida">70 brand new screenshots</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict">the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Remedy observed how the team at Arrowhead was able to navigate the ups and downs of the ludicrous third-person shooter to somewhat inform best practices for a game like FBC: Firebreak. Kayetta told me that it helped when Remedy asked, "What's working for them, what's not working for them?". But it was far from the only such game the team looked at. Kayetta name-dropped several games that the team would play together for "analysis" in the studio. Many of them make perfect sense as soon as you learn them.</p><p dir="ltr">"If it's a session-based co-op shooter, we've played it into the ground," he said, listing off a parade of recent co-op games including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547394">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/aliens-fireteam-elite/" data-ref-id="5000-527726">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide/" data-ref-id="5000-394441">Vermintide</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide/" data-ref-id="5000-516156">Darktide</a>. Like Helldivers 2, none of those were all that surprising, but one immediately stuck out the moment Kayetta said it. "We had some interesting additional reference points, too. We looked at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overcooked/" data-ref-id="5000-453001">Overcooked</a> quite a bit, because we wanted to see--like, that is such a fun type of chaos, where things get out of hand, but you still feel like you have meaningful agency despite things feeling out of hand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492663" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492663"></a><figcaption>Remedy looked to the past of co-op successes and struggles to help shape its first multiplayer game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">His comments came after I'd played the game for quite a while that morning already, so I could see firsthand the shared DNA between Overcooked and Firebreak, but it was still surprising to hear the comparison out loud. Firebreak's elemental combat and class-based systems meant everyone had a role to play, and it was apparent when anyone in the group had broken that chain of responsibility--as apparent as leaving the burgers on the stove too long and starting a kitchen fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Funny enough, though the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>-like beats are clear, Kayetta said he doesn't recall the team ever playing that one together--for good reason, however. "Interestingly, it's one of those games that's so big and so famous that I don't feel like we actually played it as a team very often, because everyone just felt like they were already bringing the full wealth of experience and knowledge about it. And so I literally can't think of one time I played Left 4 Dead with anybody on the team. It's one of those games that's just in the DNA of gaming."</p><p dir="ltr">FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. It'll launch right on Game Pass Ultimate and PlayStation Plus Premium, too. Free updates will follow later this year, bringing more missions and cosmetics into the game, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/" data-ref-id="1100-6531475">the game has taken some anti-FOMO steps</a> to keep players from feeling like the game is asking too much of their time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're coming to Remedy's multiplayer game as a lore chaser, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-fbc-firebreak-fits-into-the-remedy-connected-universe/1100-6531477/" data-ref-id="1100-6531477">how FBC: Firebreak fits into the Remedy Connected Universe.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">When FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17, it will be the latest game to add to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/">Remedy Connected Universe</a>. It's inherently a Control spin-off, even being set in the same liminal bureaucratic maze known as the Oldest House, so there's no question whether it would contribute to Remedy's Marvel-like spider web of storytelling, but after speaking to the team, we now know a bit more about <em>how</em> it will contribute to that connected universe.</p><p dir="ltr">We know the game is set six years after the events of Control. Like the 13 real-time years between both the fictional events and releases of Alan Wake and Alan Wake 2, the time between 2019's Control and 2025's FBC: Firebreak will mirror the real world. In that span, the Oldest House has remained locked down and the Hiss did not let up.</p><p dir="ltr">That's meant anyone outside of the building hasn't been able to get in, apparently. Worse, it means the unfortunate agents who were inside the shapeshifting hub that day have spent more than half a decade stuck inside with the Hiss threat. In gameplay terms, this will see player-characters running low on standard-issue supplies, resulting in them improvising with unique weapons and gear for the three-player co-op game. Still, since the game is without cutscenes or heavy exposition, lore devotees like me might wonder what else the game can teach them about the RCU. Don't worry, game director Mike Kayetta told GameSpot; there's still material there to be investigated.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew that we wanted to find ways to connect back to the [RCU] and expose things going on, especially about this time period and these people," he said, revealing that a lot of the lore will be found during loading screens. "You're not going to be able to collect documents in the game and view them--although we have talked about if that's something people want later, we'll look at doing that. But for now, we were like, 'Where are the places that we can fit things in?'</p><p dir="ltr">"And we identified the loading screens as one of these places where you can get snippets of information. So we're actually going to be introducing a bunch of additional Control lore through those screens. And we're randomizing it so that the more you play--even though you're not collecting them--the more hours you put into the game, the more you're going to actually start seeing more and more interesting things that may or may not connect to each other and to other events going on."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492665-fbc_firebreak_groundcontrol_3ss_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492665" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492665-fbc_firebreak_groundcontrol_3ss_10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492665"></a><figcaption>Though I saw familiar locales during my hands-on time with FBC: Firebreak, Remedy confirmed the game will take players to brand-new corners of the Oldest House, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492665-fbc_firebreak_groundcontrol_3ss_10.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kayetta said additional lore will drip out through the things characters say, likening it to Left 4 Dead's way of doing things. "We talked about not doing a lot of direct storytelling for a lot of reasons. We believe this is very counter to the experience, just like Left 4 Dead. It's one of the reasons they chose zombies, because you just go in and you know what zombies are [...] One of the cosmetics that we're adding to the game over time is voice packs. And each of those voice packs has a custom script, all of the lines, not just a reaction like, 'Oh, there's an enemy over there,' but also all the idle or narrative-based lines that they say.</p><p dir="ltr">"And our goal right now is that you could be playing this for, like, 20 hours and still actually be hearing new things. So they're all small, right? Because we don't want to do cutscenes and big storytelling, but they do add up to something bigger and deeper and more interesting over time. So, if you are a lore guy, you're not going to get that wild canvas that is something like Alan Wake, but we're also not ignoring it. We're taking it very seriously, and Clay [Murphy], who wrote Control, is helping work on a lot of these things too."</p><p dir="ltr">Though Kayetta didn't say this explicitly, I expect some of what FBC: Firebreak reveals about the future of Control 2 will be there for the lore divers to parse through. To that end, I'd bet my last pack of legally distinct Alan Wake Remastered flashlight batteries that we'll see the name Chester Bless, or the Blessed Organization, appear in one or more of those loading screens. If that name is new to you, you might enjoy the deep dive that is our earlier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">look-ahead on the RCU</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/modretro-chromatic-review-a-new-old-handheld-hero/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gaming used to be simple. We didn’t used to have the hassle of day one patches, of online multiplayer and subscription access, let alone FOMO-inducing battle passes. There was a purity, a focus, that’s been forgotten by many in recent years. ModRetro wants you to remember. They set out to perfect a piece of gaming royalty: the Nintendo Game Boy, but unlike other Game Boy-shaped things, they didn’t iterate or diversify, instead opting to imagine what the device would look, feel and perform like, if it was brought to market today. Imagine my surprise when I found they’ve not only resurrected a long-dead gaming giant, they’ve made it stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>The ModRetro Chromatic is still a Game Boy. It has a slot for the physical cartridges and one of the greatest things being that it plays all of your original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, as well as a new batch of games that ModRetro have curated themselves. (more on that later).</p>



<p>It even runs on AA batteries, though we’re down to three over the original’s four, and there will be a rechargeable pack option if you’re willing to spend more. Admittedly, it should have been there as standard, but the AA batteries provide the necessary heft, and inserting them sure feels nostalgic. We can complain when Microsoft stop using AAs in their controllers.</p>
<p>The Chromatic also has an original aspect and original resolution screen, and it’s the sharpest and most colourful Game Boy screen you’ve ever seen, outside of the Analogue Pocket’s 10x resolution display. The team at ModRetro were so clear about getting the screen right, they manufactured it themselves, and not only does it showcase the level of commitment to the project, it’s exceptionally sharp, bright and colourful. Thanks to the original aspect ratio, games look and feel authentic, represented as they were intended to be, but with modern enhancements like IPS panel tech and backlighting.</p>


<p>One of the most obvious changes is the shift to a metal body over the original’s plastic. Available in several colours – our review unit was a 70s-evoking bright yellow – this is a case that will outlast multiple generations. The team have even shown it surviving being driven over by a car, though it should be noted that attempts to recreate that by other reviewers have been slightly less successful. While I wouldn’t necessarily want to put mine under half a ton of car, it is unequivocally strong and robust, delightfully cool to the touch, and it’ll definitely take a few knocks in your bag or live through being shoved off a table.</p>
<p>There are exactly as many inputs as you’d expect here, so you’re getting a D-pad, A and B buttons, and then Start and Select. They’re a little clackier than I remember my Game Boy being, but they feel tight and responsive, reacting perfectly to spinning and dropping yet another Tetronimo in Tetris.</p>

<p>There’s a USB-C socket down the bottom for that additional battery pack and firmware updates – alas, we can’t escape software updates entirely – as well as a 3.5mm headphone socket to pump the glorious chiptunes straight into your ears. Besides that, there’s the down-firing speaker, which sends audio downwards rather than straight at you or the palm of your hand. It goes plenty loud though, and there’s no hint of distortion or crackling from it, once again maintaining the clarity and vision of the original composers and sound designers.</p>
<p>The volume is controlled by a plastic rotary wheel on the right-hand side of the unit, and it’s one of the few things here that feel cheap. Our review unit’s action wasn’t all that smooth either, though it stayed happily in place once the volume level had been set.</p>
<p>There’s then the link cable port on the left-hand side, and, coming across from the original Game Boy Color, an Infrared Blaster for communication between the games that support it. The team have ensured that every single original Game Boy and Game Boy Color game can be played, with all of their original features intact, and it lends the Chromatic the sense that this isn’t just a Game Boy-shaped device, it’s the Game Boy as it was always meant to be.</p>

<p>One solitary sign of true modernity sits alongside the volume wheel, and that’s the addition of a Menu button. This opens an overlay with a level of deeper control that the original Game Boy could only dream about, from brightness settings for the backlit screen, as well as frame blending, streaming setup and the ability to prevent unwanted diagonal inputs from the D-pad.</p>
<p>Some of this functionality is there to deal with the oddities of a small number of games and how they behave under emulation. It’s impressive to find that the ModRetro team have given the Chromatic that level of consideration and then found an answer for it, and it shows that this is a team of people wholly committed to bringing the Game Boy and Game Boy Color back to modern audiences.</p>
<p>Games. It is, of course, all about the games. The Chromatic is bundled with a new version of Tetris, and few titles could give you the same sensory experience in this form factor. I’ve spent hours playing Tetris on the Chromatic, and loved every single one of them, since it’s a game that just doesn’t get old. For me, it completes the concept, and if you ever owned one of the original Nintendo handhelds, you will be won over the moment you start spinning those shapes.</p>
<p>You can then play your original games. All of them. Slot a cart into the top of the unit, and away you go. I loved returning to Pokémon and Kirby’s Dream Land, two games that formed the foundation of my Game Boy collection, and it’s remarkable to find how modern they still feel when played on a brand-new device. If you’ve got a batch of old cartridges sitting around in the loft – or proudly displayed on a shelf – then you owe it to them to grab a Chromatic and re-experience them on what is, fundamentally, the best Game Boy that’s ever existed.</p>

<p>For all that the Chromatic is an incredible, nostalgic achievement, the most intriguing thing the team have done is curate a new batch of games to release alongside it. These are fully compatible Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges, which work on original hardware, with brand-new 8-bit titles on them. So, you’re getting new Game Boy games in 2025. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>These range from the lovable and old-school like puzzle-dropper Patchy Matchy, to Hermano, a 2D platformer featuring a cute skeleton that can throw his head at enemies. My favourite? Chantey, a pirate RPG, with a classic Game Boy open world, whose battles are played out by a pirate band with rhythm-action gameplay.</p>
<p>It’s hard to argue with ModRetro’s approach to the Chromatic, with a balance between nostalgia and new experiences that’s incredibly alluring. Alongside Evercade, it feels as though our gaming past – and future – is in good hands.</p>
<p>The only mild question mark is the price. At £152 in the UK, that’s not an insignificant chunk of change, and it probably puts the Chromatic just outside the instant-buy category. That’s not so bad when considering the cost of buying an original Game Boy and retrofitting it with a modern IPS screen, new case and other mod cons – this can easily run you over £100. It’s also&nbsp;a good bit cheaper than the Analogue Pocket, which offers a similar quality experience, albeit gaining the extremely useful ability to play Game Boy Advance games. That said, the Chromatic feels truer to the spirit of the original Game Boy, whereas the Analogue Pocket appears a bit sleeker and more modern.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs.1188879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The price of the PS5 has been raised outside the United States twice now, first in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">2022</a> and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">a month ago</a>, but US consumers might not be out of the woods on a PS5 price increase just yet.</p>
<p>During its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-77-8-million-units-shipped-sony-forecasts-further-decrease-in-unit-sales-for-fy2025/">financial forecasting call for the coming year</a>, Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing">confirmed</a> that the company has been considering "<em>passing on</em>" the <strong>100 billion yen</strong> hit that Sony expects to take due to the United States' tariffs on to its US customers.</p>
<p>Sony president and chief executive officer Hiroki Totoki also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-considers-further-price-rises-as-it-braces-for-500m-tariffs-impact">confirmed</a> that the company is considering moving some PS5 manufacturing to the US, saying, "<em>Hardware can of course be produced locally, I think that would be an efficient strategy. PS5 is being manufactured in many areas, whether it is going to be manufactured in the US or not - it needs to be considered going forward.</em>"</p>
<p>While the US has been able to miss out on price increases for the PS5 console so far, it hasn't missed out on increases to the games and to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/">PlayStation's PS Plus subscription service</a>. In fact, US PlayStation players should also expect another PS Plus price increase, as regions outside the US got <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">another price hike last month</a>.</p>
<p>It's possible that PlayStation chooses to take an easy competitive win compared to Xbox by keeping its console prices the same instead of raising them, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Xbox recently did</a>. Though, as Circana executive director and video game industry analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lp4wimyhfc2l">Mat Piscatella points out</a>, the current reality is that no one knows exactly what their next move will be.</p>
<p>Like Nintendo and every other manufacturer in the video game industry, Sony has multiple plans ready to execute, depending on how the tariff situation gets resolved. Microsoft has clearly made its choice for now, but everyone else is still holding their breath.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PS5 has reached 77.8 million units sold worldwide, and by that count, the console is still 1.2 million units behind the PS4, five years into its lifecycle. This is the only console generation where we are this deep in, and the prices of major consoles have gone up, instead of down.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-labyrinth-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, we had the chance to play through a <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>preview build while chatting with Bandai Namco Senior <em>Pac-Man</em> Brand Manager Knoah Piasek about this new experience: a game that combines fast-paced action gameplay with classic <em>Pac-Man</em> mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brilliantly designed with crisp gameplay, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is an exciting new metroidvania that captivated me with its impressive enemy design and challenging boss battles. After getting killed a few times, its&nbsp;mechanics clicked and I found myself taking on more difficult enemies and defeating bosses many times my size.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>is definitely a game worth looking forward to – read more on our thoughts in our <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> preview!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth's</em>&nbsp;Gameplay - A Three-Pronged Approach&nbsp;</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is a metroidvania that splits its gameplay into three unique aspects. The majority of the time, the player will be the Swordsman, jumping and slashing their way through the environments and using a grappling hook to get some verticality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To climb on walls, The Swordsman can turn into Pac-Man on certain surfaces, adding another dimension to traversing the environment. In true <em>Pac-Man</em> fashion, you're also able to consume upgrades as you move along. This also leads into some of the trickier puzzle sections, requiring you to quickly jump from surface to surface while avoiding blades and other obstacles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third and final form is Gaia, a powerful and huge transformation that gives you an edge against tough boss battles. The Gaia form can only be held for a limited time, so use it wisely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That's the brute-force form," Piasek said. "Great for boss battles, but there are some environmental puzzles where Gaia is helpful, too. Areas with breakable walls you can blast through."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exploring the maze-like worlds and switching between each form will allow players to find upgrades like new health tanks and gain the resources required to upgrade attacks and weapons. I was able to upgrade the damage on my sword during my <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>preview, making my first boss encounter much more manageable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Meet the Unique &amp; Challenging <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> Bosses</h2>

<p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>'s boss battles felt reminiscent of battles I encountered while playing&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-dread" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> several years ago. Going up against a dinosaur-looking monster many times my size, with capabilities you're not yet familiar with, was an absolute blast that kept me on my toes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had to use all three forms to battle this boss – slashing at him with my sword, climbing the walls as Pac-Man to avoid massive energy blasts, and transforming into Gaia to deal as much damage as possible once he was stunned. Though I nearly died on my attempt, I was able to take this boss down. It also helped that Piasek was by my side helping to instruct me on when to dodge and attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of metroidvania-style games with unique boss battles that test your reflexes to the limit, <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>has plenty to offer in this department, and this mechanic is just one of the many reasons why I'm looking forward to the <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> release date later this summer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When I was preparing for PAX East this year, I did not think I'd be seeing a game that combines the classic arcade-style of <em>Pac-Man</em> with labyrinth-crawling swordplay, but here we are. Initially, I was impressed at just how easy the <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> gameplay was to pick up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The development team wanted to keep this as simple and intuitive as possible, while including hardcore action," Piasek said.</p>

<p>While I played through my <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> preview on a PC at PAX East, I did ask about the console release as well, including how <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> will run on Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It runs great on Switch," Piasek said. "On Switch 2, it runs 4K 60 FPS, and full-HD in handheld mode. It's the best way to play portable, and the best way to play if you're a Nintendo ecosystem-only gamer."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>&nbsp;releases on July&nbsp;18, 2025, and it'll give fans of games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a> and <em>Metroid Dread</em> much to look forward to this summer!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and while sales are down, profits are up, largely thanks to the performance of a certain retro JRPG remake.</p>

<p>In its latest financial presentation, Square Enix reveals that sales have fallen by around 9% <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down" rel="nofollow">over last year</a>, That admittedly isn't a particularly precipitous fall, although it's not exactly likely to put smiles on the executive board's faces.</p>

<p>What might do that, however, is the fact that profits are up by around 20%, largely driven by the company's "digital entertainment" (i.e. video games) sector. One game in particular, Square Enix says, stands out as a success this fiscal year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=0f2nxVeH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=gz0KFChd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Square Enix's profits are up this year thanks to one game in particular.</figcaption></figure><p>In the report, Square Enix singles out&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>'s "stronger sales" than the company's "initial assumptions" as a driving factor behind this year's profit increase. Back in February, Square Enix revealed the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">outsold expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Other new releases this year included&nbsp;<em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>, <i>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</i>, and a port of previously iOS-exclusive RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasian</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</p>

<p>Square Enix doesn't provide sales figures for these titles, but we do know that&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>'s developer was hit by massive layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">on the day of the game's release</a>, prompting its director to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix" rel="nofollow">quit and sign up with Square Enix</a> instead (before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua" rel="nofollow">opening up his own studio</a> back in March).</p>

<p>The company also points to the success of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>in its MMO department, which, along with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest X</em>'s January update, contributed to a 2.6 billion yen increase in operating income for the MMO area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=h-nP92Sn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=h11npdAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>contributed to a boost in profits for Square Enix's MMO sector this year.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of Square Enix's future, the company is currently working on major new entries in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>franchises, although it's been quite some time since we heard from either of them.</p>

<p>Still, the publisher has assured fans that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV&nbsp;</em>is, in fact, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled" rel="nofollow">still in development</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>producer Yuji Horii has made similar <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yujii-horii-still-working-really-hard-on-dragon-quest-xii-series-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2-1541753/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assurances</a> with regards to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII</em>, so we can but hope.</p>

            <p>I am quietly optimistic about FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's upcoming co-op, PvE Control spin-off. Having played a couple of hours of it, particularly towards the end of my time, as the systemic complexity began to compound, its coming together at the last minute almost feels like a strength, as I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">our big FBC: Firebreak preview</a>. But naturally at a time when live-service, multiplayer-only games - particularly ones from studios known for the purely single-player output - are hardly the most popular pitches in the world, there is plenty of scepticism out there.</p>
<p>Speaking to game director Mike Kayatta, lead designer Anssi Hyytiäinen, and PR director Thomas Puha, however, the sense was - maybe predictably - that the studio remained bullish. They gave a few reasons.</p>
<p>"For me, at least one element there in that conversation is always the predatory practices in player retention," Hyytiäinen explains. Instead of battle passes, daily objectives and the like, for instance, Firebreak has a somewhat old-school approach of a set of upgrades to your weapons and kits, and a set of unlockable perks, both earned through the main loop of playing rounds of the game, collecting resources and spending them on said unlocks.</p>

<figcaption>FBC: Firebreak gameplay trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHw9E2eJ898" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As Hyytiäinen puts it, Remedy has intentionally aimed to make it something you can dip in and out of, "the session lengths are short - we're almost thinking: we don't have time to play games ourselves, what kind of game would we like to play that doesn't need to be sucking us in? You know when you lock in, you have 12 phases of stuff that has happened, that just reading through that is already your time gone for the night?"</p>
<p>Kayatta makes similar noises, describing the studio's inspiration in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> (along with many others), as a case of looking back and saying, "Wow, wasn't that game great - but also from the perspective of nostalgia, like: wasn't it great when you could kind of buy a game, and it might be supported over time, but ultimately, I can pick it up and put it down? And I can enjoy that game on my own terms, and not on the game's terms. Because it feels like so many things that tried to come for Left 4 Dead went in the opposite direction, where they're like, "Oh here's the fun gameplay - oh yeah but: battle passes and seasons!""</p>
<blockquote>"I'm not saying all those things are always evil..."</blockquote>
<p>"I'm not saying all those things are always evil," he adds, "it's not true. But ultimately, it is something that starts to try to tell you how to engage, and not just like, when you're in the game, but actually when you're out of the game, when do you come back to the game? How often do you need to play the game? Check in, do this, do that."</p>
<p>The inspiration instead, he says, "is more of a meta inspiration to say: what if we came back and we said, let's just focus on making a game that people like, and if they only play it for an hour a week and then they need to step away for six months, what if that was okay? What if it's okay that they go play other stuff? What if we built a game and a mandate - and a product, even, on the business level - around this idea that that's actually okay for a multiplayer game, and just get it in people's hands?"</p>
<p>The natural follow-on there is Remedy's decision to put Firebreak immediately onto Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. I asked Kayatta whether that helped take the pressure off a little, amongst the wider, tougher context of similar multiplayer games - most notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">the high-profile failure and ultimately pulling from sale of Sony's Concord</a> - having some difficult launches.</p>
<p>"From a wider industry perspective, obviously, there's always the question of: is it cannibalising sales? But of course, it's not like people put things on Game Pass for free either," Kayatta says. "I wouldn't call it a safety net for us," he adds, in that "games can't just survive exclusively by trying to be available in one service or another service." Still, he notes that Game Pass and PS Plus were both "a very welcome partnership".</p>
<p>"We never used 'games-as-a-service', 'live-service' with this game, very consciously," adds PR director Thomas Puha, during a separate conversation. "The connotation of those games is, you know, it's gonna be 'battle pass' this, Call of Duty, Destiny, all these things that were so far from that."</p>
<blockquote>"[It's] a very contested market - but then everything is contested..."</blockquote>
<p>Puha adds, too, that the studio is aware it's "a very contested market - but then everything is contested. There's tons of games. It's not like there isn't a contest with single-player games, I mean we're up against, you know, Sony heavy-hitters... there's no point in trying to build something where you've got to be playing every day, because then the machinery we've got to build here is not something we could even afford - so what's the point?"</p>
<p>According to Puha, the studio's other backstop here, meanwhile, is its shift in approach towards making multiple games at once, which Remedy's been doing since 2016. "It's very much about spreading the risk," he says, "you can see it's near impossible to survive with making a single game and then hoping that it, against all odds, does phenomenally well, and you get some money out of it. Part of our business model is that we work on multiple things, and we've said we try to ship something every year."</p>
<p>The last point the team is keen to make is that FBC: Firebreak has been made with a significantly tighter budget than what you might consider some of its multiplayer competitors. "Of course, not just taking crazy risks by doing massive budgets and so on" is also a factor, as Puha puts it. "Of course we need this game to do well, but then we have realistic expectations." The team is still only around 50 developers strong, for instance - Control's team, by comparison, was in the low hundreds. "It's not like a 200-person, five-year dev cycle."</p>
<p>To Kayatta, FBC: Firebreak's director, it also just comes back to the reasons why it exists in the first place. "I think there's a lot of cynicism around multiplayer games," he says. "And I think there's double cynicism about multiplayer games that come from, traditionally, single-player studios. And obviously I feel that - I mean I'm also a gamer.</p>
<p>"But at the end of the day, one thing that is quite nice about working on this project here is that I know - because I live it every day - that this did not come from any amount of cynicism. It has just come from passion and creative people have been given a license to say, you know, what is fun? What do we just want to do? What's interesting?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that "GPS based action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the long-absent&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV&nbsp;</em>remains in development, according to the studio.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/KHMLink_NA/status/1922540374167364055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Square Enix says that it "worked hard on developing and adjusting"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>, but that the studio would be unable to "offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time".</p>

<p>Square Enix closes by saying that "the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series will continue", and that the development team is&nbsp;"hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>", imploring fans to "keep an eye out for further updates", although no timeframe for those updates is revealed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=cg-Dox8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=9YTxRbHd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>will forever remain...well...missing.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2022</a>, alongside flagship series entry&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>. A number of closed beta tests were held in the period between then and now, but it seems that they didn't help Square Enix refine the game enough for release.</p>

<p>The game was to take place between the events of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Union&nbsp;</em><i>χ&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Dark Road</em>, both smartphone spinoffs (although what constitutes a "spinoff" in the murky world of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>can be fluid at the best of times).</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, it was to adapt the action-RPG gameplay for which&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>has become known, with players battling Heartless and other enemies in and around the land of Scala ad Caelum. Disney characters like Aladdin,&nbsp;<em>Toy Story</em>'s Woody, and&nbsp;<em>Tangled</em>'s Rapunzel were set to appear.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>, very little has been revealed about the game since that debut trailer back in 2022. We know it'll once again star series protagonist Sora, and that it'll take place in the modern city of Quadratum, but other than that, it's shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Somewhat alarmingly, series creator Tetsuya Nomura has also declared that it's possible he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetsuya-nomura-kingdom-hearts-retirement" rel="nofollow">won't finish the series before he retires</a>, so if you were hoping for closure from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>(for some reason), you might be disappointed.</p>

        <p>They're selling your Horace hat as we speak</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Details from 89 million Steam accounts have reportedly gone up for sale on the dark web. Since RPS's dedicated tech team have just informed me that the dark web is not the thing you get when you click 'incognito tab' and is actually potentially much scarier than that, you might want to consider changing your password. Or maybe not. As I say, it's all alleged at this point.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">LinkedIn post</a> by user Underdark.AI, listed as a "Computer and Network Security" page, as reported on by our network chums <a href="https://www.vg247.com/steam-vendor-data-breach-passwords-89-million-users-dark-web">at VG247</a>. From the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, a threat actor going by Machine1337 posted on a well-known dark web forum claiming to have breached Steam, offering a dataset of over 89 million user records for $5,000. The post includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Telegram contact for purchase</li>
<li>A link to sample data hosted on Gofile</li>
<li>Mentions of internal vendor data, indicating deeper access</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>They later updated the post with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following our initial post on the claimed Steam data breach (89M+ users), new evidence confirms that a leaked sample contains real-time 2FA SMS logs routed via Twilio.</p>
<p>The data includes message contents, delivery status, metadata, and routing costs — suggesting backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly.</p>
<p>This reinforces a supply chain compromise, putting user security at risk via phishing or session hijacking.</p></blockquote>
<p>X user Mellow_Online, who shared the news on that platform, says that <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1922458722485317664">they were contacted by a Valve representative</a> who "stated that they do not use Trillio", the data protection company mentioned in the LinkedIn post.</p>
<p>Data security is very far out of my wheelhouse - I still think it's funny to say "I'm in" in a hacker voice whenever a website loads after being slow for a bit - so I'm not to going to add additional comment (though I have asked Valve for one). Do with this information what you will!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
