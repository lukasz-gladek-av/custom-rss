Players take on the role of the tree’s caretaker, controlling familiars (golems) and turning the tree into a fortified mobile fortress as they progress on their journey.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Game System</strong></p><p>First, gather resources on the ground. Collect not only materials for construction but also food to satisfy your golems’ hunger, as well as “lost technology” left behind by the past inhabitants of this world.</p><p>You can build various structures on the back of the sapling. Depending on your strategy, you can construct walls to protect its core, weapons to defeat monsters, and rooms for golems to work in.</p><p>However, if you cannot effectively manage your time, resources, the stamina of your golems, and the weight and strength of buildings, the journey to the nursery bed will be a challenging one.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884225"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Once you’re prepared, embark on your journey. The World Tree sapling will take the form of a large beast and begin moving.</p><p>During the journey, monsters attracted to the World Tree’s vitality will attack relentlessly. These monsters will destroy buildings and target the World Tree’s core. Use your golems and weapons to fend off the monsters’ attacks.</p><p><strong>Demo Available During Steam Next Fest: June 2024 Edition</strong></p><p>To coincide with the Next Fest event on Steam, which runs from Monday, June 10, 2024, to Monday, June 17, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT, a demo version of <em>Ark of Charon</em> will be available starting Thursday, May 30, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT.</p><p>The demo offers a comprehensive look at the beginning of the journey with almost no restrictions on in-game content.</p><p><strong>Early Access Version Launches July 9</strong></p><p>The Early Access version of <em>Ark of Charon</em> will be available on Steam starting Tuesday, July 9, 2024.</p><p>Get early access to the game at a discounted price before the full release. The Early Access version includes upgraded technology and powerful enemies beyond what is featured in the demo, providing a nearly complete gameplay experience.</p><p>During the Early Access period, we will actively gather feedback from players via the Steam community and other channels to enhance Ark of Charon. Expect regular updates as we work towards the full release.</p><p>When the full version is released, Early Access players will be upgraded to the full version for free.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the first trailer below.

Starting with Season 11, the Hero Mastery Gauntlet, a round-based tower defense mode that sees players team up against robots, will no longer be accessible.</p><p>Hero Mastery Solo Courses will remain available as a single-player offering, with more courses promised to arrive in future seasons. You can see the full statement below:</p><p>Hero Mastery Gauntlet launched in March 2024, meaning it will have only been available for around three months before it’s dropped. Although the mode has been criticized by many, some are disappointed not only because it’s leaving so soon, but because it represents another scrapped PvE mode in the history of Overwatch 2.</p><p>In May 2023, Blizzard announced it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>no longer be adding the long-promised PvE Hero mode</u></a> to Overwatch 2. It had been touted as one of the biggest changes for the franchise, which was largely known for its PvP content, since Overwatch 2 was originally announced. Director <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-director-pve-hero-mode"><u>Aaron Keller eventually apologized for the change of course</u></a>, calling the mode an “exciting but gargantuan vision.”</p><p>Overwatch 2 launched in 2022 as a sequel to Blizzard’s original hero shooter. While we enjoyed it upon its release, giving it an 8/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review"><u>our review</u></a>, the hero shooter follow-up has changed in a few major ways in the last few years.</p><p>Following the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-league-officially-ending-as-blizzard-focuses-on-new-direction"><u>decision to shutter the Overwatch League</u></a> late last year, Blizzard announced that it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-actively-working-to-let-all-overwatch-2-players-experience-a-hero-the-day-a-season-drops"><u>make new heroes available to all players to enjoy</u></a> instead of locking them behind a premium battle pass purchase. The company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-10-will-unlock-all-heroes-and-change-how-mythic-skins-are-earned"><u>made good on that promise with Season 10</u></a>, delivering all past playable characters and its newest Damage hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-venture-gameplay-trailer-trial"><u>Venture</u></a>, available to all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The current season runs for another 28 days, meaning you have just less than one month to squeeze out that last bit of fun from Hero Mastery Gauntlet before the co-op mode is gone for good.

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has a pretty big map, and in the traditional style for this type of game, a lot of it will be dark when you first start playing. The good news is that it will be covered with structures known as a Resonance Nexus to help you out.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The Resonance Nexus is an easy way for you to get additional map information and get a vision of everything you might be missing. It might not sound like much, but it can be very useful in the early game and cut down on a lot of confusion just to understand how this mechanic works. Keep in mind that you can be in an area covered by a Resonance Nexus, and if you don’t have the device activated, the map will stay dark.</p>
 <h2 id="h-all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">All Resonance Nexus Locations in Wuthering Waves</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Interactive Map</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">There will be a total of 11 Resonance Nexus to find when you first start playing Wuthering Waves. These are, essentially, giant server farms that you can visit to download map data about the surrounding area. Each time you find one and interact with it, it will give you the data you seek, and a large portion of the map will become visible. They are also extremely useful as fast travel points and allow you to heal any damage you have taken or revive fallen characters in your party. </p>
 <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="87" data-injectable="false">You can find the Resonance Nexus in the following locations, as shown on the map above:</p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"> <li>At Whining Aix’s Mire</li> <li>To the northeast of Whinig Aix’s Mire, on the coast</li> <li>To the southwest of the Dim Forest, on the coast</li> <li>Tiger’s Maw, in the northwest of the area</li> <li>To the southwest of Wuming Bay</li> <li>To the west of Tiger Maw, halfway to the Port City of Guixu</li> <li>Jinzhou, almost directly in the center of the city</li> <li>Far to the east of Jinzhou, on the islands</li> <li>North of the Gorges of Spirits</li> <li>North of the Central Plains</li> <li>South of Desorock Highland</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">These are not the only fast travel points in the game, as you can also access a huge number of Resonance Beacons while you travel the map. There are 68 of the Beacons in total, so they are far more prevalent, but they do not give you the ability to cure wounds or revive fallen characters in the same way that visiting a Nexus does.</p> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="false">Now, when you go and activate all the Resonance Nexus points is up to you, but I traditionally find it very useful just to do this as early as possible. Being able to fast travel to almost anywhere based on the quests, side questions, or just general random stuff that comes my way in a game like this is always useful. If I suddenly need to be halfway across the map to farm some ascension/development materials for a character, I would like to be able to just do it. So, 30 minutes or so spent running around the map early in the game can be a real time saver.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We’ve been getting numerous hints recently that the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s Call of Duty</a>, rumored to be a Treyarch-developed continuation of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ops series set during the Gulf War</a>, is likely not far away, and few more bits of information dropped today back that up.</p>
<p>First up, the reliable Call of Duty experts at <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Intel</a> revealed the <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existence of a website</a> featuring what appears to be a teaser for the next Call of Duty (how Charlie Intel found said website is a bit unclear – I have a feeling Activision themselves may have given them a “tip.”) You can check out one of the live-action teasers found on the site below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: The first Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser is here 👀</p>
<p>New website found: <a href="https://t.co/8B9C5QIKur">https://t.co/8B9C5QIKur</a> <a href="https://t.co/JcW4mhTHDh">pic.twitter.com/JcW4mhTHDh</a></p>
<p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the video shows some group making a statement by putting blindfolds reading “The Truth Lies” on the Presidential noggins of Mount Rushmore. Another teaser on the site shows the same group putting up posters featuring an image of the blindfolded Mt. Rushmore. Of note, one of the blindfolds features a wolf-like logo that looks very much like the one Microsoft used to tease a “Direct” that will be broadcast directly after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>. It’s widely expected this Direct will be focused on the next Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reliable insider account <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billbil-kun</a> has leaked a image of what appears to be Call of Duty 2024’s key art. The image has been intentionally blurred by the leaker, but we can still glean something from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔒 REDACTED 🔒</p>
<p>Call of Duty $S7&amp;5°+/45%86 <a href="https://t.co/02AACE67Io">pic.twitter.com/02AACE67Io</a></p>
<p>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1793344752768704797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we can’t make it out perfectly, the blurred character above seems to be posing in a very similar way to the key art for the original Call of Duty: Black Ops and numerous games in the series since. The orange and gray color scheme also screams Black Ops.</p>
<p>So yeah, pretty much everything is yelling that this year’s game will be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, or perhaps to follow the naming convention of the last game in the series, Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase and Call of Duty reveal will take place on June 9, so mark your calendars. What do you think? Getting excited for what Treyarch is cooking up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NDfSx0">Continuity in the Mad Max movie series is pretty confusing. It might be hard to believe, but the 40-year-old franchise spawned from a micro-budget Australian movie about raiders in a post-apocalyptic wasteland doesn’t actually have the most coherent timeline. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, the full-speed-ahead latest film in the series, doesn’t clear anything up, although it does have a specific timeline connection to its predecessor, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. But we’ll do our best to help you understand it.</p>
<p id="4jaX4s">The first important thing to remember about <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/93Nq0">Mad Max’s timeline</a> is that it kind-of-sort-of got rebooted. <em>Fury Road</em>, the fourth installment in the series, was originally planned for production in the ’90s or early 2000s, with Mel Gibson returning to his central role as roving loner Max . However, after numerous delays, and numerous instances of Mel Gibson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mel-gibson-controversies-timeline-antisemitism-dui-2023-10">being a horrible person in public</a>, the movie got an updated script and a new Max — the much younger Tom Hardy. </p>

<p id="QCq9cr">With the change in actors and in Max’s apparent age, the series had to be changed slightly, too. So <em>Fury Road</em> is essentially set in an alternate timeline from the original movies, where key events happen at slightly different times. In <em>Fury Road</em>’s timeline, the nuclear annihilation of huge portions of humanity happened between the events of <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>The Road Warrior</em>, rather than after <em>The Road Warrior,</em> like they do in the original trilogy. </p>
<p id="JQAwrQ">This feels especially confusing given that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23981365/furiosa-mad-max-trailer-fury-road-anya-taylor-joy-hemsworth-george-miller"><em>Furiosa</em>’s first trailer</a> says the movie takes place 45 years after “the Collapse.” Technically, this means the movie probably takes place a little less than 45 years after the events of <em>The Road Warrior</em>. This doesn’t make a ton of sense when compared to the events of <em>Fury Road</em>, especially if it’s the same Max character.</p>

<p id="j2gvy1">But if you’re trying to square that math either with the events of the original Mad Max trilogy or with <em>Fury Road</em>, let me offer some helpful advice: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23180299/obi-wan-kenobi-show-age-fictional-character-played-by-actors#:~:text=Why%20does%20Obi%2DWan%20Kenobi,character%20played%20by%20different%20people.&amp;text=You%20see%2C%20Obi%2DWan%20Kenobi,and%20he%20died%20in%202000.">Don’t.</a> It probably doesn’t make sense. In fact, the <a href="https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/mad-max-fury-road-2015/mad-max-fury-road">comic books that came out since <em>Fury Road</em></a> tried to fit its timeline back into the original trilogy, and never got close to succeeding. </p>
<p id="2UGcIQ">And you know what? That’s OK.</p>
<p id="sEzkuu"><em>Mad Max</em> director, writer, and creator George Miller, in his infinite wisdom, rightly decided with the release of <em>Fury Road</em> that maybe Max is an idea larger than petty grievances like canon and continuity. Max is a myth and a legend, and as Miller himself said, anything that happens to him is just “an episode” in a tumultuous life, with no specific connection needed. As he put it in a press conference for <em>Fury Road</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="cpT7Tl">All the films have no strict chronology. It’s probably after Thunderdome, but it’s an episode in the life of Max and this world. It’s basically an episode, and it’s us revisiting that world. I never wrote the story, <em>any </em>of the stories, with a chronological connection.</p></blockquote>
<p id="BZWqWN"><em>Furiosa</em> is no different, and that first trailer said as much in its first few seconds. This is her <em>Odyssey</em>. She’s destined to become a myth, and myths are too important to worry about exactly how the details line up. We know this is a prequel because it deals with her childhood and young adulthood; we know it spans 15 years of her life because she tells us in the movie itself that 15 years have passed since we first saw her on screen. But in terms of exactly how much time passes between the end of <em>Furiosa</em> and the beginning of <em>Fury Road… </em>Miller isn’t concerned with that, and we don’t need to be either.</p>

The catch? You can only use them after his secret taunt - the one that involves Akuma sitting on the ground, chomping on a rice ball for 30 seconds.</p><p>Most characters only have three super moves, but Akuma has a whopping <em>seven</em>, although that includes the two hidden ones that aren't included on the move list. Despite that secrecy, various <a href="https://x.com/FGAnniversaries/status/1793344865176002632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans on social media</a> were quick to discover both the hidden taunt and the supers that come with them, which IGN has verified independently. </p><p>As mentioned, it all starts with the secret taunt. To pull that off, perform Akuma's back taunt by holding back and pressing all six buttons, then mash down on all those buttons. That'll lead to a taunt that sees Akuma eating a rice ball, and once he's finished his snack, you can perform the two hidden supers, which you can see below (along with some helpful instructions from my colleague Mitchell Saltzman):</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first is done by doing two quarter circles back and pressing kick. This one is actually a call back to Kage’s V-Trigger 1 in Street Fighter 5, Rikudo Osatsu. The other one is performed by pressing down, down, and all three punch buttons, and it's essentially his super move from Street Fighter 5.</p><p>That’s not all, though! While in this state, he can also unleash his classic double air fireballs by doing quarter circle back and two punches while jumping forward in the air, and it doesn't even cost meter.</p><p>Although, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1cy62bu/akuma_has_2_hidden_supers_he_can_use_after_one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as fans were quick to point out</a>, the moves aren't <em>super </em>viable when it comes to competitive play, as the taunt literally leaves the warrior sitting with his back turned to his opponent for 30 seconds. Still, it's a fun Easter Egg - and, as popular fighting game streamer <a href="https://x.com/maximilian_/status/1793354716753309842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximilian Dood notes,</a> it gives Akuma players a way to open Evo matches in the funniest way possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If two Akuma players at <a href="https://twitter.com/Evo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Evo</a> start the set with this taunt, the roof will blow off the convention center. <a href="https://t.co/w8BDsKG2Ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/w8BDsKG2Ds</a></p>— Maximilian Dood (@maximilian_) <a href="https://twitter.com/maximilian_/status/1793354716753309842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As mentioned, Akuma entered the Street Fighter 6 fray in an update just earlier today, which has led to a spike in interest for the fighting game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, there were 70k players on Steam just earlier today, quite the jump from the 5k-25k that were playing in the days prior to the update. Akuma's a bit of a classic boss for the Street Fighter series, having been introduced all the back in Street Fighter II, so it's little surprise the see fans psyched for his addition.</p><p>IGN gave Street Fighter 6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">a 9/10 a year ago</a>, with Saltzman writing at the time, "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2023/2900-4922/" data-ref-id="2900-4922">best games of 2023</a>.

And if you typically buy books from Amazon, you will <em>definitely </em>want to choose the hardcover collector's edition version.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">collector's edition is available for $27 (was $45)</a>, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Standard/dp/1913330036?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the standard edition paperback is currently listed for $43</a>. This is rather peculiar considering Amazon had the standard edition for around $20 at various points last year. What's even stranger is that the standard edition launched with a $30 MSRP. And yet, the price at Amazon for the standard edition has been climbing for several months--and this $43 listing is indeed shipped and sold by Amazon. But you can still <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhowl.me%2Fcmi4SadIJLq&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-guidebook-is-much-cheaper-than-the-paperback-on-amazon%2F1100-6523640%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab the standard edition guide for a great price, as Target has it for $18.79</a>.

At the same time, it's certainly possible that the collector's edition version will hover around $27 for months. That said, its all-time low price is only about a buck less, so the chances of "overpaying" at this price are pretty low.</p><div title="6523640 - TotK Collector's Guide Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2397" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523640 - TotK Collector's Guide Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Complete Official Guide (Collector's Edition)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$27 (was $45)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This guide features 496 pages and covers everything you'd need to know about Tears of the Kingdom.

While Amazon has it listed for $43, a third-party reseller on Walmart is selling it for just $19.

                <p dir="ltr">Nightdive Studios is best known for refreshing classic shooters for the modern era, and with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Ffully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frevisit-turok-and-other-old-school-shooters-with-humbles-retro-fps-bundle%2F1100-6523654%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble's Fully Loaded bundle</a>, you can grab nine of Nightdive's PC remasters for a mere $20, taking you straight back to the Nintendo 64 era with some of the pioneers in the first-person shooter genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Headlining the Fully Loaded bundle are three dinosaur-blasting games: Turok, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. All three sport enhanced graphics and gameplay improvements that make them easier to play for modern audiences, while still capturing the fast-paced arena-style shooting and blocky dinos that made them great back in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">The bundle also offers a bunch of other games that originated on the Nintendo 64. There's the mind-bending Forsaken, which is a shooter that gives you full 360-degree movement, and Doom 64, which is one of the wildest entries in the Hellish FPS series--and thanks to Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal, Doom 64 is now an important part of the modern Doom canon.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Humble bundles, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Ffully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frevisit-turok-and-other-old-school-shooters-with-humbles-retro-fps-bundle%2F1100-6523654%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fully Loaded bundle</a> offers a "pay what you want" structure. For $5, you get three games--Turok, Sin: Gold, and Blood: Fresh Supply--along with a coupon for 10% off PO'd: Definitive Edition in the Humble Store. Kick the price up to $10 and you'll add Forsaken: Remastered, Doom 64, and Turok 2 to the list. For $15, the bundle adds Powerslave Exhumed and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while $20 gets you everything from the previous tiers, plus Turok 3.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a charity tied to the bundle, so you can choose to pay more to give a little to Active Minds. The charity focuses on providing mental health awareness and education to young people ages 14 to 24.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble has a few other bundles you might want to check out, as well.

            <p>
Sublime grid-filling puzzle series Picross is returning to Switch this month for another retro-themed collaboration, developer Jupiter this time teaming up with Bandai Namco to release Picross S: Namco Legendary Edition on 30th May.
</p>
<p>
Much like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-an-official-mega-drive-and-master-system-themed-picross-game-heading-to-switch-next-week">2021's Picross S: Mega Drive &amp; Master System Edition</a>, Namco Legendary Edition takes Picross' beloved puzzle action - in which players use number clues to correctly fill in squares on a grid and complete a picture - and infuses it with retro-game theming, albeit this time delving into Namco's illustrious archive of classic arcade titles.
</p>
<p>
30 Namco titles will be represented across a total of 585 puzzles, with the likes of Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, Xevious, Rolling Thunder, and Splatterhouse all putting in an appearance.

Plus, while it’s not 60 hours long, it packs a lot of great stuff into its short runtime, including duels, boss fights, a full skill tree, massive gun fights, and a fantastic ending. </p><p>You can currently pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/204450/Call_of_Juarez_Gunslinger/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204450/Call_of_Juarez_Gunslinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Call of Juarez: Gunslinger </em>on Steam for just $1.50</a></span>! That’s practically nothing, and this creative FPS is worth it. Even better, <em>Gunslinger </em>runs like a dream on Steam Deck. (Some players have reported issues with the cutscenes, but I didn’t notice that when I played.) The sale’s set to run through the end of May, so get it while the gettin’s good.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you love Spiderman action figures, Marvel legends, or the Avengers- you need this 1-4 player game for ages 14 and up.</p></div></div>
<p>Marvel United is a rules-light and affordable adventure game that works superbly for nearly any age. Each player takes on the role of a unique superhero and work together to thwart a villain and their henchmen. Heroes are fueled by their deck of action cards, with players utilizing these cards to activate various locations around a city, beat down minions, and confront the main rival. While there are a series of Marvel United titles and many product options, the best starting point is the recently released Spider-Geddon set. This offers a large amount of content with an intriguing set of heroes and adversaries.</p><h3 id="anchor2">Marvel: Crisis Protocol</h3><div id="198422"><p><h3>Atomic Mass Games Marvel: Crisis Protocol Earth's Mightiest CORE Set</h3></p><div><p>"Unleash the power of 13 all-new miniatures, featuring legendary characters like Captain America and Ultron, to assemble your dream team from the Marvel Universe."</p></div></div>
<p>Ever wonder what it would be like to play Warhammer 40,000 but with Marvel heroes instead of Space Marines? Marvel: Crisis Protocol is the answer. This is a heavily detailed miniatures game that requires players to assemble figures. You can dive deep into this hobby, painting each character with painstaking precision, as well as constructing buildings and elements of terrain to fight over. The ruleset is splendid as it focuses primarily on small teams of mixed heroes. Each character is distinct with their own suite of abilities and powers. It’s a dynamic and exhilarating game with a wonderful flow. For a more thorough look, you can read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-crisis-protocol-earths-mightiest-core-set-board-game-review"><u>review of Marvel: Crisis Protocol.</u></a></p><h3 id="anchor3">Marvel Champions </h3><div id="198423"><p><h3>Fantasy Flight Games Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h3></p><div><p>"Join forces as Marvel's iconic heroes and thwart the schemes of powerful villains."</p></div></div>
<p>This fully cooperative card game has players wielding unique decks for superheroes such as Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and Black Panther. Each hero has a number of specific ability cards representing their various powers in combination with a central character card that can flip between their hero persona and their alter ego. Players manage their hands and decks in order to dish out damage against a central antagonist such as Rhino or Ultron. The villain, which is controlled entirely by a personal deck of cards, pursues their own agenda to threaten the innocent and achieve world domination. For those that are particularly smitten with this title, you can expand your collection with dozens of additional hero packs and larger expansion boxes.    </p><h3 id="anchor4">Marvel: Remix</h3><div id="198424"><p><h3>WizKids Marvel: Remix</h3></p><div><p>"Create an epic battle with a hand of cards in Marvel: Remix."</p></div></div>
<p>As the smallest game on this list, Marvel Remix is a tidy card game that can be tossed in a bag and taken nearly anywhere. This competitive design has players trying to assemble a hand of heroes, villains, locations, and items. Each card has various symbols that interact with other cards, as well as its own scoring condition. With deft play you can build a hand with several intersecting combinations that yield enormous point gains. Since you only make your way through a portion of the deck and there are a wide range of creative synergies, this little game beckons continual play and exploration. </p><h3 id="anchor5">Marvel Dice Throne</h3><div id="198425"><p><h3>Dice Throne Inc. Marvel Dice Throne</h3></p><div><p>"Suit up for battle in Marvel Dice Throne - a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful Marvel heroes, and unique abilities."</p></div></div>
<p>Dice Throne is the successful competitive dice battler that has been kicking since 2018. Just recently the series made the jump to Marvel, featuring heroes such as Black Widow, Captain America, and Thor. Each character has their own set of dice and abilities, and players take turns rolling their dice and assigning the results to their various unique powers. The goal is to deal enough damage to defeat your opponent in this quick and clever head-to-head bout. While play is streamlined and relatively uniform, the asymmetric playstyles for each hero encourage experimentation and add just enough texture to maintain long-term interest. There are some truly empowering moments when you manage to roll your special finishing maneuver and unleash maximum power.</p><h3 id="anchor6">Marvel Zombies - A Zombicide Game</h3><div id="198426"><p><h3>CMON Marvel Zombies - A Zombicide Game</h3></p><div><p>"Enter the gripping world of "Marvel Zombies" in this thrilling Zombicide game adaptation, where even the mightiest heroes have succumbed to the relentless zombie plague."</p></div></div>
<p>Zombicide is the popular miniature heavy cooperative survival game where players fight the dead while seeking to accomplish various scenario-specific objectives. Marvel Zombies shifts the series to the popular Marvel storyline where an infection has spread and the heroes have begun to turn into powerful undead legions that crave flesh. Beyond the naturally slick adaptation of the Marvel property to this series, this game flips the traditional Zombicide script by having players take on the role of superhero zombies hunting humans. It features an entirely new hunger mechanism while pushing gameplay into several distinct directions that changeup the formula. This may very well be the best Zombicide yet, as its crammed full of wonderful ideas and shining Marvel miniatures.</p><h3 id="anchor7">Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R.</h3><div id="198427"><p><h3>Fantasy Flight Games Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R.</h3></p><div><p>Join forces with up to 5 players in Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R., a thrilling cooperative board game where iconic Marvel heroes team up to battle nefarious forces threatening the world.</p></div></div>
<p>D.A.G.G.E.R. stands for “Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Response”, and this is the organization that players are affiliated with this in globe-spanning adventure game. The scope here is larger than any other title on this list, as players travel around the world to put out fires and confront enemies. Villains terrorize cities and launch evil machinations for greater purpose, and heroes such as Daredevil, the Hulk, and Elektra must do everything within their power to shut it down. This is a lengthy game, but it’s one with scope that provides for a more epic adventure with many ups and downs. It delivers a fully realized vision of characters responding to threats and traveling to various regions in order to thwart evil. There is a real sense of being overwhelmed and having to triage threats in order to stay ahead of the curve and prevail.  </p><h3 id="anchor8">Unmatched: Marvel </h3><div id="198428"><p><h3>Restoration Games Unmatched: Marvel</h3></p><div><p>"Redemption Row brings three of Marvel’s most tortured heroes into the arena."</p></div></div>
<p>The Unmatched series is a collection of games that pit fighters against each other in head to head bouts. Think Street Fighter on a tabletop, except it trades out Ryu and Ken for heroes of all different time periods and properties. There are sets that feature mythic and literary figures such as King Arthur or Alice from Alice in Wonderland, and there are also sets that highlight pop culture characters such as Grant from Jurassic Park or even Ghost Rider. Yes, there is an entire suite of Marvel characters spread across several products, allowing players to wield icons such as Moon Knight, Spider-Man, and Black Widow. The game itself is smooth and simple as each character is fueled by a deck of asymmetric cards that represent their unique attacks and powers. In just 20 minutes, two participants can square off and beat the heck out of each other utilizing a simple and rewarding ruleset. Over multiple plays you can come to understand the nuance of these characters, just as if you were learning a moveset while playing an electronic fighting game. This is a fantastic, inexpensive product line that is entertaining and lean.</p><h3>Splendor: Marvel</h3><p>The original Splendor is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">best engine building board games</a>, so it makes perfect sense to give it an even more popular makeover with the Marvel brand. In this version, players are collecting infinity stone tokens that they can spend to add Marvel characters to their growing band, trying to stop Thanos from taking over the universe. Each character you add serves as one or more stones against future purchases, so it’s very much a game of trying to build the most effective hero-engine to acquire the last cards and stones that you need to push past the victory criteria before your opponents. Easy to lean but with plenty of challenge to enjoy and with enough differences to the original to please fans of that, it’s hard to go wrong with this reskinned classic. </p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet: A Love Letter Game</h3><div id="200954"><p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet: A Love Letter Game</h3></p></div><p>Another classic game reskinned with an infinity stone theme, this one takes the bluffing game of courtly courtship Love Letter and turns it on its head, with players assigning heroes to fight Thanos. In a major gameplay change, however, this is a one versus many game, with one player taking the role of The Mad Titan and the others assembling superheroes to try and thwart their evil plan. Thanos has their own deck and can hold two cards, while other players can hold one hero each at a time, and it’s still very much a game of bluff as many card effect revolve around swapping or guessing what the opposition is holding and potentially dealing damage if you get it right. Thanos looses if his life pool is reduced to zero and wins if he can kill the heroes or collect a full set of infinity stones. It’s a smart twist on a winning formula with simple rules, sure to win new converts and please existing fans alike.</p><h3>Marvel Villainous: Infinite Power</h3><div id="200955"><p><h3> Marvel Villainous: Infinite Power</h3></p></div><p>Villainous is an innovative line of games in which players take on the roles of famous villains from Disney franchises, trying to advance their personal plots while dishing out infuriating fate cards on their opponents. Marvel, of course, has some of the most iconic villains of all and this box lets you walk in the wicked shoes of Thanos, Killmonger, Taskmaster, Hela, or Ultron. Each has a unique set of decks and victory goals, meaning the game has considerable replay value as well as strategic depth. There are beginner and advanced versions to make to suitable for different player ages. And best of all, you get the chance to play the bad guy, plotting your path to power and cursing your peers, in a genre of games that’s almost always focussed on the heroes.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It quickly became the biggest hit of the year so far, turning into both a sales juggernaut and a cultural phenomenon. And in an era of hyper consolidation, it made Arrowhead Studios an obvious target for acquisition by the game’s publisher, Sony. Months later, co-founder Johan Pilestedt maintains the Sweden-based team of over 100 has no plans of becoming another cog in the first-party PlayStation machine. </p><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196406,192516" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p> “We pride ourselves on being an independent studio,” he told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new interview today</a></span>. “We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly.” Pilestedt also announced today that the studio has hired former Paradox Interactive executive Shams Jorjani to be its new CEO while he moves into a chief creative officer role to focus more on keeping <em>Helldivers 2</em> a top-10 live service hit. </p><p>The two say Arrowhead now has ambitions of being a flagship studio that can rival the best in the world, especially when it comes to the hyper-competitive landscape of online co-op games. “When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at,” Jorjani said. “I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.”</p><p>But <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s overnight success has also made it a lightning rod for controversy and assholes.

The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity.</p></blockquote><p>While the Arrowhead executives said the team’s plans are only growing more grandiose, it doesn’t plan to scale up to the size of a full-blown AAA studio anytime soon. It’s also going to slow down the pace of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s updates so it can maintain quality amid the chaos. “We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches since we feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve,” community manager Twinbeard recently wrote on the game’s Discord. </p><p>It sounds like at least for now, however, players will still be getting new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond-ps5-steam-roadmap-1851451513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond-ps5-steam-roadmap-1851451513">Warbond battle passes</a></span> on a near monthly basis.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s massive May update--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-massive-may-update-is-finally-here-check-out-the-patch-notes/1100-6523488/">the biggest to hit the game</a> since its September 2023 launch--arrived last week, introducing tons of new quality-of-life features (like improved scanner function and surface maps) and long-awaited bug-fixes for some of the game's most important quests. The May update ostensibly has it all, from options to tweak combat difficulty to increased inventory space and even improved ship-decorating mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">As a fan of Bethesda's previous games (and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/" data-ref-id="1900-6418098">huge space nerd</a>), I was excited to get my hands on the update and take it for a spin. Disappointed by the state of the game at launch, I'd awaited this update with bated breath, hoping Starfield would finally get the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> treatment and rise like a phoenix from its buggy, underwhelming ashes. Unfortunately, upon firing up the game, I discovered something incredibly disheartening: Rather than drastically improving Starfield's gameplay, the May update instead makes the game's flaws even more evident and introduces new bugs. Later, I stumbled into an even more painful truth: Although the update itself is available free of charge, some of the update's best quality-of-life improvements come with a surprising price--one that players might not be willing to pay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306709"></a><figcaption>Players who take advantage of Starfield's new settings may be unhappy to learn that some quality-of-life improvements come at a surprising price.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Playing on Xbox, I fired up an old save and immediately proceeded to test out the new surface maps and scanner functions. Functionally, the new three-dimensional surface maps do a fantastic job of helping players get their bearings and allow them to survey a planet's topography without having to physically run around to see if there's anything worth finding on it. The new maps don't exactly scream, "Hey, there's a really cool point of interest over there!" but the 3D details that now appear on a planet's surface map mean players can spot buildings, unusual rock formations, and other details that may indicate the presence of an interesting locale they might wish to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 3D maps for major buildings, as well, which make getting from point A to point B significantly easier when exploring large enclosed areas with multiple floors. Prior to the update, players could only rely on a trail of arrows that would appear on the ground while using the scanner, pointing them in the direction of their current objective. Those guide arrows are still there, and still have a tendency to disappear at random, but players now have more options than simply putting the scanner away and taking it back out again to get them to reappear. The new update's 3D building maps make it much easier to figure out which floor certain destinations are located on, but appear to be available only for large or unique buildings, like the fully enclosed city of Cydonia on Mars. If a player finds themselves struggling to navigate oft-reused structures, like the Robotics Science Facility on Volii Chi, they'll still have to rely on the guide arrows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306704" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306704"></a><figcaption>Starfield's new surface maps make navigating easier, but also demonstrate how empty the galaxy feels, even on major planets like Mars.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The new 3D surface maps work well but also demonstrate exactly how empty many of the game's 1,000+ planets truly are. POIs are still extremely sparse on most planets (even those with large settlements, like Mars), and players are still going to find themselves running for several minutes straight--with nothing but rocks to look at on the way--to get from their landing zone to the undiscovered POIs on their maps. Even with a fully tricked-out Boost Pack and a dose of Amp (which temporarily increases movement speed by 35%), getting around in Starfield remains an exercise in frustration. Traveling from one POI to another on-foot still takes far too long, but on the bright side, Bethesda has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">announced that ground vehicles are finally in development</a>. In the meantime, Starfield's scanner has been updated with a useful new feature: When activated, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-biggest-update-since-launch-arrives-on-may-15/1100-6523100/">POIs now pop up on the scanner</a>, allowing players to select them and fast-travel instantly, without having to waste time navigating through multiple menus to do so.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's a downside. Naturally, players cannot fast-travel to undiscovered POIs until the player has unlocked them by first reaching the location on foot. But returning players will likely be displeased to discover that even POIs they've <em>already</em> discovered must be re-unlocked if they want to fast-travel there with the new scanner function. I've already explored every inch of New Atlantis, for example, and while I can still fast-travel to The Lodge and various other locations via the menus on the starmap, those locations are not unlocked for me on the scanner. This also means returning players will be repeatedly bombarded with "New Location Discovered" notifications when arriving at POIs they haven't visited since before the May update, and will obviously not be earning any XP for re-discovering these locations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306705"></a><figcaption>Returning players must re-unlock visited POIs to use the scanner's new fast-travel function.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg"></figure><p>Speaking of XP, one incredibly important detail Bethesda left out of its marketing for the May update is the fact that making use of certain new features can affect how much XP a player earns. One of the best features in the update is the ability for players to tweak things like the difficulty of ground combat vs. space combat from the game's settings menu. Players can even increase the amount of credits that vendors have on them (making repeated trips to sell off stolen goods a thing of the past) and tweak how much weight their character can carry. But there's a price: Increasing your character's carry weight will decrease the amount of XP you gain. Increasing the distance from which you can access items in your ship's cargo hold will have the same effect. Changing your character's carrying capacity from Normal to Increased will decrease the amount of XP you earn by 6%. Upping your carrying capacity to Greatly Increased will cost you 8% of your earned XP. Allowing yourself to access your ship's cargo hold from anywhere will knock off another 6%. Increasing vendor credits from Normal to Greatly Increased decreases your earned XP by a further 4%.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306706"></a><figcaption>The new settings are great, but the price players pay for using them is rather steep.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With my character's carrying capacity set to Increased, vendor credits set to Greatly Increased, and my ship's cargo accessible from anywhere, I was earning a total of 16% less XP per activity than I otherwise would. But even stranger than that, tweaking combat damage (in space or on the ground) has zero effect on the XP you earn. It seems odd that Bethesda is set on punishing players who want to avoid repeatedly fast-traveling back and forth to access their ship's cargo hold, making multiple trips to multiple Trade Authority locations to sell their goods, or listening to their companions repeatedly complain out loud that they're carrying too much because the game's woefully inadequate default carry capacity means they're constantly finding themselves overencumbered. Why give players the option to play the game their way and then punish them for it?</p><p dir="ltr">Players looking for a challenge will be rewarded, however, as decreasing vendor credits, ship cargo accessibility, and carry weight will increase the amount of XP players earn. But this makes the fact that there's absolutely zero XP penalty for increasing the damage one does in combat (or decreasing the damage enemies can do) even stranger. I tested this by running the "Eyewitness" quest with max player damage and minimal enemy damage--reducing the difficulty so severely came with no XP penalty but did make the battle laughably easy, reducing one of the game's most formidable monsters into a creature roughly as dangerous as a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radroach" rel="nofollow ">Radroach</a>. One wonders what Bethesda's goal is with regard to XP penalties and bonuses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306725"></a><figcaption>Many of Starfield's persistent bugs are harmless and hilarious, but others can prove quite frustrating.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the topic of Radroaches, replaying the Terrormorph questline also revealed that there's still quite a lot of work to be done in terms of squashing the game's many bugs. I encountered naked miners on Cydonia, saw my companions walk around without a spacesuit on planets with no atmosphere while brandishing invisible guns, and had an entire conversation with the back of an NPC's head (it seems the issue with the game's camera glitching out during dialogue sequences is still alive and well). After disposing of the comically feeble Terrormorphs that attacked New Atlantis, I turned around to discover that a vital NPC companion appeared to have been downed or killed in the fight. The option to speak with her was still appearing, but selecting it didn't wake her up, so I made my way back to the UC Vanguard soldiers who I'd left to hold the line behind me.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon striking up a conversation with the soldier who was meant to debrief me, the game entered a dialogue scene, but presented no dialogue options for me to choose from. Unable to exit the dialogue or access the game's menu, I was forced to restart, and upon doing so, discovered the automatic save created when I exited the game had been corrupted, renaming my character to "Dude Mack" and changing her level from 31 to "##." I went back to a previous save, made in the moments after I put down my last Terrormorph, and loaded in to find that the entirety of New Atlantis had become a game-breaking shade of yellow that made it almost impossible to see anything. After restarting the game once again, the save finally loaded correctly, and the mysteriously downed NPC was alive and well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306708"></a><figcaption>Bugs are still alive and well in some of Starfield's most prominent quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Starfield's May update is certainly a step in the right direction, and features like the ability to decorate one's ship in the same manner as an outpost or player home are fantastic. Updates to Photo Mode now allow players to choose from a variety of facial expressions for their character, and they can also change the pose and expression of whichever NPC the player has accompanying them, making photo ops more appealing. The 3D surface and building maps are extremely helpful, as is the new ability to fast-travel from the scanner. But ultimately, Starfield still suffers from the same issues that plagued it at launch, from frustrating bugs to empty planets with little of interest to discover. By far, the biggest issue with the new update is that some of its most useful features--like the ability to access ship cargo more easily, carry more items, and make fewer trips to Trade Authority vendors--come with a built-in punishment for players who dare to make use of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Bethesda hasn't shared when players can expect to gain access to ground vehicles for planetside exploration, their addition will hopefully improve the core experience of the game, and one hopes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">the Shattered Space expansion coming this fall</a> will also add a bit more depth to a game that currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/">feels a mile wide and an inch deep</a>. I'm still hopeful for the future of Starfield and am looking forward to the new expansion. But after experiencing the game's biggest update yet, I fear that Bethesda's decision to penalize players for making use of sorely needed quality-of-life improvements and persistent bugs in some of the Starfield's biggest quests will continue to negatively impact the game, and I find myself wondering if other features planned for the game might also come with a hidden price. Vehicles are all well and good, but not if I'll have to synthesize my own gasoline to use them, or suffer an XP penalty for daring to cram a few too many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-made-the-sandwich-from-the-starfield-trailer-and-you-can-too/1100-6493196/">space sandwiches</a> in the trunk when I embark on an interstellar picnic.</p>

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Semi-automatic weapons often get overlooked by their fully automatic counterparts, yet the M16A4 deserves plenty of attention. </p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">The M16A4 requires an abundance of skill and patience to perfect. Instead of firing and forgetting like other assault rifles, the M16A4’s three-round-burst firing type eliminates any margin for error and forces players to be accurate with their shots. When perfected, it will become second nature to take down enemies in two bursts, but in the beginning, there will be plenty of instances where you get punished for missing a shot by fully automatic weapons. That persistence will eventually payoff, as the M16A4 is arguably one of the best weapons in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-m16a4-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best M16A4 loadout in <em>XDefiant </em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Rapid Fire </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Superlight Grip </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>Reflex Sight </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Grip Tape </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Padded Stock </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">Every second matters while using a burst weapon. The quicker you can aim down sight with the M16A4, the more effective it will be. With that in mind, our loadout focuses on improving ADS speed, rate of fire, sprint speed, and recoil recovery. This set of attachments slightly hinders vertical and horizontal recoil, but not enough to be worth worrying about.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;faction for the <em>M16A4</em></h2> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="false">Choosing a faction comes down to personal preference. Still, the Cleaners provide the best set of abilities to make the M16A4 flourish. To start, the Incendiary Rounds kill enemies faster in short to medium-range engagements, which is perfect for the burst rifle, and the Firebomb ability is perfect for trying to clear off an objective on offense, or weaken an enemy to make them killable with one burst.</p>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League might not have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">done the numbers Warner Bros was expecting</a>, but developer Rocksteady continues onward with its post-launch plans, with its imminent Season 1 - Episode 2 update introducing new enemies, new gears, and more.
</p>
<p>
Season 1 - Episode 2 is a mid-season update for Kill the Justice League, and follows the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-first-season-kicks-off-with-the-joker-this-month"> arrival of The Joker as a playable character</a> at the end of March. As such, it's light on major headline features, but it does bring a few gameplay additions while players wait for the next big update.
</p>
<p>
For starters, The Joker's Elseworld map - introduced alongside the character - is "opening up further". This expanded version adds "tricky" Green Lantern infused enemies - immune to all direct damage until their Constructs have been destroyed - and the new Promotinaut enemy, capable of promoting its allies to their next, more powerful level of mutation.

<p>
Additionally, Season 1 - Episode 2 introduces the new Out of Orbit mission. Here, players must topple corrupted Justice League Watchtowers, which have only partially phased into the world and are invulnerable to attack, by locking their control points so Task Force X can get stuck in. There's an added complication in that enemies can exist in one of two dimensions during the mission and players will need to keep switching dimensions to take them out.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there a "villain's banquet of all-new gear". Players can access three tiers of the Two-Face Infamy Set, alongside new gear from the likes of Black Manta, Reverse-Flash, and Firefly. Full patch notes - which include changes to the way Mastery Level progression is calculated and an increase for the base number of rewards earned from Metropolis missions - can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/315210/view/4166471135946509586">found on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Season 1 - Episode 2 update launches tomorrow, 23rd May, with three more seasons to follow according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">Rocksteady's road map</a>. Additionally, there's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/315210/Suicide_Squad_Kill_the_Justice_League/">60 percent off the Steam version</a> until 3rd June, bringing the price down to £23.99 for the standard edition if your interest is piqued.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell gave Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">three stars out of five in his review</a> back in February, saying "Rocksteady's talent is so evident in the game, it almost overcomes the terrible decision to try and make it."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/diana-jones-award-emerging-designer-winners-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming is coveted in the tabletop industry. Founded in 2001, the award is gifted to people, products, concepts, or groups that have demonstrated spectacular quality within the industry. Now we have Diana Jones Award 2024 Emerging Designer winners, highlighting new talent in the industry.</p>



<p>According to a post on their <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>, the Diana Jones Award for Emerging Designer went to four deserving winners. These winners were decided via an anonymous committee of 50 industry professionals, including designers, creatives, consultants, and publishers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rebuilding-seattle-game-pieces.jpg?itok=U_quI7Nt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rebuilding-seattle-game-pieces.jpg?itok=64vKYwgr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Elegance of design is recognized here.</figcaption></figure><p>The first of these winners is Quinn Brander. Brander was the creative voice behind 2023's <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368463/rebuilding-seattle" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Rebuilding Seattle</em></a>, an economic city-building game with a simple ruleset. He is working on a 2025 follow-up, <em>Rebuilding Chicago</em>, and an ambitious co-op roguelike campaign game.</p>

<p>Winner number two is Puerto-Rican British TTRPG designer and project manager Taylor Navarro. Navarro is a Big Bad Con Scholar whose work includes <em>Tales of Sina Una</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>D&amp;D 5e</em></a>, <em>The Seeker's Guide to Enchanting Emporiums</em>, and her own indie project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/taylornavarro/not-yet-a-romantic-ttrpg-duet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Not Yet: A Romantic Duet TTRPG</em></a>.</p>

<p>Notably, Taylor is recognized for her commitment to raising up fellow creators. She co-organized the Dragonmeet 2023 POC Lounge and Networking Mixer and regular contributor to the UK Tabletop Industry Network.</p>

Simpson's career began in videogame development but dove into board game development in 2019. Since then, he has been the co-designer on the award-winning board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368058/the-wolves" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Wolves</em></a> and designed <em>A Message From The Stars</em>, <em>Chomp</em>, and <em>Merchants of Magick</em>.</p>

<p>The fourth and final winner is Basil Wright. Wright's design philosophy is to make games that promote community, have a low barrier to entry, and draw magic from the mundane. Their body of work are notably weird entries like <em>Pelogos</em>, <em>You're Naked, Run!</em>, and <em>You Can (Not) Pet The Cat</em>.</p>

<p>All four winners will receive a prize package worth over $6500. The package includes a one-year voting membership in GAMA and an expenses-paid trip to Gen Con 2024.</p>

<p>Past winners of the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming have been venerable names in the industry. Those winners include Erlc Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>), the board game <em>Ticket To Rid</em>e, and the very concept of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-gauntlet-at-garden-rolls-dice-at-madison-square-garden"><em>Dimension20</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced"><em>Critical Role</em></a>.</p>

WB Games’ crossover platform fighter dropped in Open Beta in 2022, and the plan at the time seemed to be a smooth transition to a full launch. Instead the game was temporarily shut down, despite having run multiple Battle Passes and taking real money for skins and other cosmetics. Several months later, a relaunch is right around the corner with 1.0 scheduled for May 28, 2024. So, what happens to all that purchased content, and would there be any compensation for those founding players when <em>MultiVersus</em> returned? The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest wave of info</a></span> from developer Player First Games has laid it all out, and we’re here with the condensed version.</p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><h2 id="h47474"><a id=""></a>Will old purchases be retained?</h2><figure id="" data-id="c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-recommend-id="image://c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A MultiVersus graphic breaks down details about Perks, Fighters, Prestige, an Gleamium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A MultiVersus graphic breaks down details about Perks, Fighters, Prestige, an Gleamium." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-recommend-id="image://c3e2f5e50413fa0df2eb25d6181f04f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A MultiVersus graphic breaks down details about Perks, Fighters, Prestige, an Gleamium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So when it comes to rewards previously earned in Open Beta Battle Passes, as well as purchased characters, skins, and other cosmetics, the answer is yes. You’ll have all your stuff. One exception is Perks since that system is being overhauled, but real money wasn’t involved there. A new currency called Prestige was announced, which is earned through acquiring cosmetics and leads to more specialized cosmetics. Returning Open Beta players will get a chunk of Prestige currency upfront, based on their standing unlock collection.</p><h2 id="h47475"><a id=""></a>What about gold?</h2><p>Gold, which was the only in-game currency (aside from Gleamium, the real money currency) in the before times, is being removed entirely. Any unspent gold will be converted to “commemorative cosmetics” which are exclusive and, according to PFG, won’t be available otherwise. It’s unclear at the moment if these gold bonuses will then contribute to Prestige.</p><h2 id="h47476"><a id=""></a>Will character and Battle Pass tokens carry over?</h2><p>Yes! Like gold (and unlike Gleamium), tokens offered in the Founder’s Pack will not be a part of <em>MultiVersus</em> when 1.0 launches. However, any tokens players didn’t cash in before Open Beta ended will still be usable. So if you were saving your character tokens or hadn’t cashed in on Battle Passes yet, you’ll still be able to do so in 1.0.</p><h2 id="h47477"><a id=""></a>Will <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0 reward returning players?</h2><figure id="" data-id="a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-recommend-id="image://a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="561" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of MultiVersus' season 1 battle pass is shown, depicting the character of Jason as the first unlock rewarded." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of MultiVersus' season 1 battle pass is shown, depicting the character of Jason as the first unlock rewarded." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-recommend-id="image://a558c6884664fc2172263a8ee148c1ae" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="561" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of MultiVersus' season 1 battle pass is shown, depicting the character of Jason as the first unlock rewarded." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aside from what’s carrying over in the new <em>MVS</em> economy, Open Beta participants will also be rewarded in a couple of different ways for simply coming back. One of these ways is time-sensitive, while the other currently doesn’t have an expiration date.<br></p><p>If you played <em>MultiVersus</em> before and log into the new version <strong>before June 11, 2024</strong>, you’ll get access to the Season 1 Battle Pass. That comes with immediate access to <em>Friday the 13th</em>’s Jason Voorhees, who will be exclusive to the Battle Pass for the duration of the season. Afterwards he’ll show up for unlocking by other means, of course.</p><figure id="" data-id="61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-recommend-id="image://61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snow Suit Finn is pictured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snow Suit Finn is pictured." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-recommend-id="image://61db27fce5666b688c64a3a996506db5" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snow Suit Finn is pictured." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also, Open Beta players coming back to <em>MultiVersus</em> at any time will get some goodies, namely a Snow Suit Finn character variant (<em>MVS</em>’ term for skins), a Rising Stars ringout animation, and a Banana Guard announcer pack.</p><h2 id="h47478"><a id=""></a>Any other freebies?</h2><figure id="" data-id="720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-recommend-id="image://720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Male and female variants of Banana Guard are shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Male and female variants of Banana Guard are shown." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-recommend-id="image://720a45b0e7eb79221dc4451d7723ea4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Male and female variants of Banana Guard are shown." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s also a little something for anyone who shows up for <em>MultiVersus</em> 1.0. One of the new characters, Banana Guard from <em>Adventure Time</em>, will be a free unlock for everyone who completes the tutorial. The tutorial kicks off a seven-day calendar, which ends with a Lady Banana Guard character variant. Rewards for the other days aren’t specified.<br></p><p>To sum it all up, anything you had leftover from the <em>MultiVersus</em> Open Beta will either still be available, or converted in some way to fit into the game’s overhauled economy. You’ll also get a couple of bonus cosmetics, and full access to the first Battle Pass. Also, for funsies, everyone who shows up gets Banana Guard. On paper, that seems like a lot of stuff!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been a tumultuous run for Netflix's popular adaptation of The Witcher novels and games. A series of setbacks and controversies led to a long delay after the show lost its star, Henry Cavill. Now a brief season four teaser gives us our first look at Cavill's replacement in the role of Geralt of Rivia, Liam Hemsworth.</p>
<p>The video above reveals little about the direction for the season beyond establishing that, yes, Hemsworth is now Geralt, and here's what it looks like. He looks the part, though it's hard for some fans to imagine him matching Cavill's pitch-perfect presence and delivery for the character.</p>
<p>See, Cavill is famously a passionate gamer. He's talked at length about his deep fandom of <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, his experiences playing <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and yes, his experiences with 2015's immensely popular open-world RPG <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>. He even has appeared in a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gYUVQrLzQ">building a gaming PC</a>.
</p><p>Rumors abounded when the former Superman actor announced he was departing Netflix's show after season three, including some rumors that he had left over creative differences with the showrunners over staying faithful to the spirit of the source material. We may never know the full story, but it looks like Cavill is on to bigger and better things: He's attached as producer and star of a major Marvel Cinematic Universe-scale effort by Amazon Studios to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/forget-the-witcher-and-superman-henry-cavill-to-lead-warhammer-40k-dream-project/">turn the lore-dense <em>Warhammer 40K</em></a> into a big-budget, live-action phenomenon.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The onboarding of Liam Hemsworth to the role was announced in tandem with Cavill's departure. Here's an excerpt from Cavill's statement at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf. As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men. Liam, good sir, this character has such a wonderful depth to him. Enjoy diving in and seeing what you can find.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been previously announced that the series' last season will be season five, so Hemsworth will portray the character for two seasons. Events in season three suggested that the show will, in the future, focus just as much on Freya Allen's Ciri, though.</p>
<p>Season four is currently in production and is expected to premiere on the streaming service in 2025.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a> is bringing a whole lot of adjustments to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> when it drops on June 4--so many, in fact, that Bungie is detailing them over thousands of words and multiple blog posts. One of the biggest is an overhaul of the Well of Radiance super ability for Warlocks: one that players have relied on in Destiny 2's toughest content for years on end.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie detailed a whole lot of changes to various subclass abilities in an extensive <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/tfs-abilities-tuning-preview">blog post</a>, mirroring another big one it dropped last week <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-divinity-gun-is-getting-nerfed-in-the-final-shape/1100-6523497/">focused on weapon adjustments</a>. Well of Radiance is likely to have the biggest effect on the game, though. It drops a round location that a whole team of up to six players can stand in, boosting their weapons, healing them, and providing major defensive bonuses. That means that at least one Warlock character running Well of Radiance has been essential to basically every team playing high-level content since the super ability's introduction in the Forsaken expansion in 2017.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Final Shape, Bungie is looking to reduce the reliance on Well of Radiance so that it's an option in high-level content, but not a requirement--and therefore, players will have more options for how to approach tough fights, without some players being stuck filling a certain role. But that means that Well of Radiance is getting some adjustments and some nerfs; Bungie is altering the well so you don't have to stand right inside it quite so much, and making it less powerful, so that it doesn't effectively render players invulnerable, the way it does right now. The changes are amplifying Well as an offensive option but downgrading it as a defensive one.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's how Well is changing, as Bungie put it in its blog post:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Well of Radiance</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Now grants radiant for 8 seconds when players exit the Well of Radiance area.</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced player survivability while standing in the Well of Radiance aura.  <ul><li dir="ltr">Reduced healing per second from 100 to 50 health points, matching restoration x2.</li><li dir="ltr">Increased heal on cast from 40 to 300 health points.</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced damage resistance vs. non-boss combatants from 40% to 20%.</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced damage resistance vs. boss combatants from 40% to 10%.  <ul><li dir="ltr">Note: damage resistance vs. enemy players is unchanged.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Increased maximum Orbs of Power from defeating targets while in your Well of Radiance aura from 4 to 5.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, Bungie is also making adjustments to Ward of Dawn, the "Titan bubble" super ability. Right now, Ward doesn't see a ton of action because Well is usually a better option. It provides a ton of protection to anyone inside the bubble, as well as an overshield and a weapon buff called Weapons of Light to anyone who passes through it, but its applications are still a little limited--especially because you can't enjoy Ward's protection and still shoot at enemies, like you can with Well.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is amping up the defensive usefulness of Ward of Dawn to make it a more viable option, but scaling back its offensive side somewhat, according to the blog post. You'll now gain a Void overshield slowly even if you're close to the dome but not inside it, and the caster of Ward of Dawn can create more Orbs of Power for teammates by killing nearby enemies with melee attacks. But Bungie is removing the Weapons of Light buff from the super--to get that, you'll need to use the Helm of Saint-14 Exotic helmet along with your Titan bubble.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's the complete rundown on Ward of Dawn changes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Ward of Dawn</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Armor of Light:  <ul><li dir="ltr">Removed Armor of Light overshield. Ward of Dawn now immediately applies a full Void Overshield to the caster and allies that enter its dome.</li><li dir="ltr">Armor of Light now instead grants additional damage resistance to players inside the Ward of Dawn:30% vs. enemy players and 60% vs. enemy combatants.  <ul><li dir="ltr">Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn dome remains roughly the same as it was before vs. PvE combatants.</li><li dir="ltr">Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn is significantly lower than it was before vs other players in PvP, and cannot be further increased by stacking Bastion Barricades inside the Ward to gain additional Overshield layers.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Allies near the Ward of Dawn dome now have Void Overshield trickled on over time, similar to the volume behind a Bastion barricade.</li><li dir="ltr">No longer provides Weapons of Light by default. This behavior has been moved to the benefits of Helm of Saint-14.</li><li dir="ltr">The Ward of Dawn caster can now generate additional Orbs of Power by defeating enemies with melee attacks in or near their Ward of Dawn dome.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Bungie's blog post covers a <em>ton</em> more changes to supers and abilities that go well beyond Well of Radiance and Ward of Dawn, though. Adjustments are being made to make some Arc subclasses a little more viable than they currently are, specifically for Hunters, while Bungie is applying some significant nerfs to others. Some of the most-used Strand abilities, like Titans' Banner of War, are seeing some nerfs, and Bungie is rebalancing other stuff all over the board. Check out the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/tfs-abilities-tuning-preview">full blog post</a> for all the details--just make sure you clear a little time, because you're going to be reading for a while.</p>

As of now, 67 percent of players show less interest in strategic thinking over the last nine years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, no specific cause was determined beyond a "larger, long-term cultural/psychological shift."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with that, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.steamdata.ninja/genre/Strategy">SteamData</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shows strategy games have grown since 2015. As of 2022, the genre peaked at over 2,400 titles released.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The percentage of strategy titles released has stayed steady over time. Since 2016, the genre has made up six to around seven percent of games released per year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a game-by-game basis, some have seen slight growth or steady coasting in the years post-release. For example, player counts for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/281990/charts/#max">Stellaris</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/#max">Civilization 6</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have shot up and down, depending on the launch of a new expansion or mechanic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it's worth noting those are well-established games. Speaking to Game Developer, Quantic Foundry's Nick Yee noted strategy players are putting their time toward well-known games and franchises, just at less intensive difficulties.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The strategy space has gotten simpler, and gradually turned more niche. For every relatively simple game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/marvel-s-midnight-suns-director-worries-the-card-mechanic-kept-players-away">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">there's something more mentally demanding like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Total War: Warhammer 3.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Core strategy players have stayed the same, but Yee said the "problem" lies in everyone else. A shift in the larger player demographic (old and new alike) means they may "care dramatically less" about the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yee also pointed out the strategy decline isn't gender-specific. This reduction is "remarkably consistent" for men and women, and equally so for US and non-US players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In general, no one demographic or cause appears to be responsible. The pandemic couldn't be blamed, but it was speculated to have "exacerbated or prolonged" the fall-off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, the study hypothesized this be owed to a larger cultural shift toward short attention spans. The rise of shorter videos and computer app usage was noted, along with a greater sense of cognitive overload.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Quantic Foundry notes, this implies players "prefer shorter time horizons to plan for...and less complex decisions that rely on fewer parameters to consider."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The full study from Quantic Foundry can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2024/05/21/strategy-decline/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant’s&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xdefiant-loadouts-and-class-setups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loadout selection</a> offers an abundance of powerful weapons to dominate the matches. Yet, a few of them feel slightly less robust or are just downright tricky to move around&nbsp;with. We’re here to show the best&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>guns with our tier list, ranking both Primary and Secondary Weapons.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-guns-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">What are the best guns in XDefiant?</h2> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">For this&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>weapon tier list, we’ll begin with the best guns through the S Tier. Then, it’ll shift over to other standouts that can benefit other playstyles.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-s-tier" data-injectable="false">S Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false"> <li>AK-47</li> <li>M16A4</li> <li>ACR 6.8</li> <li>MP7</li> <li>M60</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-a-tier" data-injectable="false">A Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true"> <li>Vector .45 ACP</li> <li>MP542</li> <li>TAC-50</li> <li>MP5A2</li> <li>P90</li> <li>SVD</li> <li>TAC-50</li> <li>RPK-74</li> <li>686 Magnum</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-b-tier" data-injectable="false">B Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li>M4A1</li> <li>Double Barrel</li> <li>M249</li> <li>MK 20 SSR</li> <li>M44</li> <li>M1911</li> <li>93R</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-c-tier" data-injectable="false">C Tier</h3> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"> <li>MDR</li> <li>M870</li> <li>AA-12</li> <li>M9</li> <li>D50</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">The&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>S Tier compiles the best Assault Rifles, SMGs, and LMGs to use. Most of the list showcases ARs, each with their&nbsp;own&nbsp;beneficial usage. For example, the M16A4 excels in both long and close-range attacks. It’s rare to see an Assault Rifle have such a range, but this unique feature will undoubtedly make matches much more accessible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="866" data-injectable="true">Although I’ve always been an SMG enthusiast, I was surprised that an LMG could have enough power to reach S Tier. Considering their massive size, these weapons are usually challenging to wield, yet their mobility is easy to manage with the right <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xdefiant-controller-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controller settings</a>. The M60 is an excellent choice as an LMG due to its significant ammo size and elite firepower. I’ve gone up the ranks several times using this bad boy, and it always comes in clutch, no matter the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">But if you prefer even more mobility, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP7</a> SMG is your best bet. Everything about this gun feels smooth in movement speed, which could make it easier to run from gunfire.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">Aside from the MP7, the Vector .45 ACP is one of the best-starting weapons in&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>. The only reason it’s at the A Tier is due to its reduced mobility stats. It’s still a good SMG, but if you want more ammo, go for the P90.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">For those who&nbsp;prefer a more strategic, long-range approach, the Marksman SVD and Sniper TAC-50 are your best friends. The SVD, with its one-shot kill potential, and the TAC-50, a superb choice for precision shots, will give you the edge you need in&nbsp;long-range combat.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">The 686 Magnum is a standout among the Secondary Weapons in&nbsp;<em>XDefiant,</em>&nbsp;earning its place in the A Tier.&nbsp;It boasts the highest firepower and superior accuracy for long distances, making it a formidable choice.</p>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, Shotguns aren’t the best weapons&nbsp;to use, so only one made it to B Tier. The Double Barrel offers the highest amount of damage at the cost of accuracy.&nbsp;Others, like the MDR and AA-12,&nbsp;aren’t up&nbsp;to&nbsp;par, but this could change with buff updates.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="false">Depending on your playstyle,&nbsp;the B and C Tiers could&nbsp;still&nbsp;prove valuable.&nbsp;Though,&nbsp;I would steer clear of the C Tier to save you the headache, especially with their lower damage rates and slower movement. </p>

However, that’s looking more and more doubtful as the few remaining players seem tired of the lack of updates, the bad skins, and grinding endlessly for little reward. I’m not sure even Batman or Superman could save the day at this point. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When people think of<em> X-Men </em>games they mostly think of action titles that let you mow through enemies as iconic characters like Cyclops and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-morph-wolverine-romance-love-gay-non-binary-1851484402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-morph-wolverine-romance-love-gay-non-binary-1851484402">Wolverine</a></span> with reckless abandon. Those are all well and good, but they miss out on the best part of the<em> X-Men</em>: the relationships! Beyond fighting off evil humans, evil mutants, and evil robots, the<em> X-Men</em> have always been about a large cast of loveable outcasts growing and bonding with each other. We need a game that brings that to the forefront. With its heavy emphasis on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-social-links-1851092540">social links</a></span>, in which players bond with characters to learn new story beats as well as unlock powerful mechanics for combat, <em>Persona</em> is the series to look to for inspiration. </p><p>Furthermore, the next<em> X-Men</em> game should also be set in a school. While both the Fox movies and the recent X-Men ‘97 series feature the school as a location, the school life of the Xavier Institute’s students is never front and center—it takes a backseat to the heroics. The Institute is one of the main settings for the comics, but since the <em> X-Men</em>’s most iconic characters are adults, the actual school aspects of the location never seem all that important. </p><figure id="" data-id="677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-recommend-id="image://677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl with glasses talking to the Persona 3 protagonist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl with glasses talking to the Persona 3 protagonist" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SEGA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-recommend-id="image://677feb532563a2c7a8fa2f38af9c79a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl with glasses talking to the Persona 3 protagonist" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But I’m here to tell you that it’s essential. As demonstrated in comics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472">Grant Morrison’s <em>New X-Men</em></a></span><em> </em>and Jason Aaron’s <em>Wolverine and the X-Men</em>, a major part of the mutant story is about how the new generation of mutants is taught by the old guard. Putting players in the shoes of a new student is a way to acclimate them to the complex world of the <em>X-Men</em> and introduce them to fascinating characters and a myriad of activities to pursue. Teaching them about what’s going on in this strange world is literally the point of a school!<br></p><p>Oh, and this <em>Persona</em>-esque <em>X-Men</em> game should not put you in the boots of the most iconic, characters. At this point, playing as Wolverine or Cyclops is tired and boring—these are are characters that have been done to death. Instead, those characters should be NPCs taking on roles as professors at the Institute. That gives them a key role without forcing the game to be entirely about them. There are so many interesting young mutants that deserve their chance in the limelight. Be it the New Mutants, Generation X, or Morrison’s unique cast of newbies (like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Herman_(Earth-616)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Herman_(Earth-616)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glob Herman</a></span>), fresh faces are the best way to go for a new<em> X-Men</em> game. </p><p>Mechanically, the school then operates as it does in a <em>Persona</em> title. Players can spend their days in the progressing in-game calendar choosing to boost certain skills: Combat could be improved by going to the Danger Room, you could increase your intelligence by studying with Beast, and more. All of this would then be supported by social links with different professors and fellow students.</p><figure id="" data-id="9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-recommend-id="image://9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A class of mutants sitting in desks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A class of mutants sitting in desks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-recommend-id="image://9d056775a7e76dbca27c24745a1510b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A class of mutants sitting in desks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The social sim aspects would be balanced with combat, like sending players out on missions that function similarly to <em>Persona</em>’s dungeons. Picking and choosing your party of X-Men and fighting off iconic enemies satisfies the need to live the power fantasy of a superhero with some customization options to boot. A varied list of party members could shine the spotlight on some beloved but lesser-known characters. It also gels with the way the team is represented in the comics: part strike force, and part student body.

While that’s exciting, it means my pipe dream of a <em>Persona</em>-like <em>X-Men</em> title is even further from reality, as Insomniac sits pretty squarely in the traditional third-person action space. But that won’t stop me from hoping that one day I’ll get that perfect<em> X-Men</em> game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But like any long-running franchise, the series has had its high points and low points. With a bunch of new players and old fans alike about to jump into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123">Disney</a></span> x <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-sephiroth-boss-olympus-coliseum-ff7-1851367491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-sephiroth-boss-olympus-coliseum-ff7-1851367491"><em>Final Fantasy </em>crossover</a></span>, we thought we’d pit 11 bad bitches against each other and rank the series from worst to best. Grab your keyblades and your closest anthropomorphic animal friend, it’s time to start a keyblade war.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts χ</em> is one of the most divisive things Square Enix has ever done with the Disney RPG series, as it presents one of the most pivotal, foundational pieces of storytelling the franchise has had up to this point in a mobile gacha game. The events of <em>χ </em>are hinted at throughout the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>franchise, but you’re mostly operating in the aftermath of what is set in motion by this game. It has some neat ideas, such as letting you create your own character within the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>universe, and while getting to it is a time sink, the story is pretty compelling for long-time fans. But it’s a baffling example of how cumbersome Square’s handling of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ worldbuilding has been over the past 20 years.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts Coded</em>, while mostly fine to play, is one of the more contrived entries in the series. The mobile game and its DS remake ooze “made just to put a <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game on the platform,” and its place in the series’ ongoing plot is so flimsy that it doesn’t have much reason to exist. It largely was made to reuse old Disney worlds by digitizing records of Sora’s past adventures into a virtual world as a roundabout way of explaining a message Sora receives from Mickey at the end of <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>, though there are some more substantial scenes at the end of the <em>Re:coded </em>DS remake. Ultimately, it’s the definition of a filler game in a series that doesn’t usually have those.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> had a whole lot of storylines and character arcs to wrap up by the time it was finally released in 2019, including the story of Aqua, one of the heroes of <em>Birth by Sleep</em>. Rather than bloat the game further with those details, Square Enix cut a slice of <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> out to release it in the <em>2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> package and call it <em>Birth by Sleep: A Fragmentary Passage</em>. The prelude is a short, sweet taste of what would come in <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, and gave fans a chance to reacquaint themselves with Aqua, who had been hidden away in the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>equivalent of purgatory since the events of <em>Birth by Sleep</em>. The most important thing it does, though, is explain why Mickey wasn’t wearing a shirt at the end of the original <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>. Priorities.<br></p></div><div><p>Perhaps the most universally adored part of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is composer Yoko Shimomura’s incredible score. It perfectly marries tributes to the Disney source material with an emotional earnestness that has perfectly punctuated every world and moment. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-might-be-enough-to-sav-1845725522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-might-be-enough-to-sav-1845725522"><em>Melody of Memory</em></a></span>, the latest game in the series, is a rhythm game that pays tribute to Shimomura’s work. Because this is a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> game, it still has to tie into the story and have some big narrative reveal at the eleventh hour, but even with the contrived framing of searching through Kairi’s memories to facilitate a rhythm track, <em>Melody of Memory </em>is a delight to play and a reminder that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ soundtrack is a stunning collection of compositions.<br></p></div><div><p>Part of me wants to be sympathetic to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-3-5th-anniversary-ending-1851209676&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-3-5th-anniversary-ending-1851209676"><em>Kingdom Hearts III</em></a></span> because after over a decade of fans waiting for another numbered entry, there was no game that could have reasonably met the lofty expectations Square Enix set itself up for by releasing spin-off after spin-off, building up both the series’ lore and the anticipation for a climactic conclusion. Sora, Donald, and Goofy’s latest Disney world-trotting adventure has some really standout moments. The <em>Toy Story </em>and <em>Monsters Inc.</em> worlds made great use of Pixar stories, and the <em>Tangled</em> chapter is a pretty lovingly crafted retelling of a modern classic. But there are some duds here, too. The <em>Frozen</em> world feels especially beholden to corporate chains that likely prevented the studio from riffing on the original story, and the <em>Big Hero 6</em> world starts out strong but ends up completely contradicting core themes of the source material. Meanwhile, some of the returning worlds like Olympus and the Caribbean squander the opportunity to offer more exciting detours.</p><p>But overall, it feels like <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>falls victim to the unmanageable weight of expectations. Its attempts to wrap up every storyline the series had been setting up for nearly 20 years feel rushed in the eleventh hour; the floaty, button-mashy gameplay feels like it hadn’t learned much from the last decade of action RPGs; and its inclusion of the reliance on theme-park-based ride attacks becomes a burdensome bore. When <em>Kingdom Hearts III </em>hits, it <em>really fucking hits</em>. But too often, it can’t seem to get out of its own way.</p></div><div><p>Looking back, it’s kind of wild how well <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> manages to introduce characters like Roxas and Axel without giving you the full rundown on their whole deal. But luckily, fans wouldn’t have to wait very long for them to get their own prequel game in 2009’s <em>358/2 Days</em>. The DS game tells the story of Roxas coming up in the villainous Organization XIII, and introduces another fan favorite in Xion. Even for a DS game, <em>358/2 Days </em>does a pretty solid job at recreating the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series’ action, and lets you play as multiple characters from across the series, each with distinct playstyles. It’s sadly not playable in modern remasters, as the <em>1.5 Remix </em>compilation only includes its cutscenes so newcomers can familiarize themselves with its story. But at the time, it was a solid effort to bring the series to the DS, and proved, like <em>Chain of Memories </em>before it, that the non-numbered <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games could have substance and be vital pieces of the overarching puzzle.<br></p></div><div><p>2012’s <em>Dream Drop Distance</em> was the final setup game before <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, and it manages to spin a lot of meaningful character development into weighty lore dumps, though the latter sure takes some time to show up. Unlike a lot of other spin-offs, <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>isn’t as reliant on old worlds, is one of the best versions of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ combat on a handheld, and properly sets Sora on a path to personal growth in <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>. It took several years for Square Enix to follow up on its world-shattering cliffhangers buried after a lot of filler, but <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>was a reminder that when <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>has intention, the team can cook. It also gave us the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_az9H864IA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_az9H864IA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic scene of Mickey getting choked out by Xemnas</a></span>. Your fave could never.<br></p></div><div><p>This will probably be one of the more controversial placements on this list, but this is my party and I’ll stan <em>Chain of Memories </em>if I want to. <em>Chain of Memories</em>, the Game Boy Advance deck-building game, set the standard for what <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>would become. Sora’s trek through Castle Oblivion is the first spin-off and establishes that every <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game would matter in the long run. <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>’s opening hours make zero sense if you haven’t played <em>Chain of Memories</em>, and even after it’s made its own introductions, so much of the sequel (and the franchise at large) is building off of it nearly 20 years later. The Riku route you unlock after beating the game? A cultural reset.<br></p><p>On top of setting the tone for the rest of the franchise, <em>Chain of Memories </em>is an incredibly underrated deck builder. The cards you have inform your combos, abilities, and strategies within an action game framework that was pretty impressive for the GBA. Its sprite work is still gorgeous to this day, and god, I wish the original was more readily available. <em>Chain of Memories </em>was remade for the PlayStation 2 as <em>Re: Chain of Memories</em>, which does away with the 2D style for something that resembles the original game on console. That’s the version that has been ported to every system under the sun, and it is, in my opinion, far inferior. Sure, it’s got voice acting and some mechanical tweaks, but it’s not the same, dammit.</p></div><div><p>I don’t believe the “<em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is too complicated” meme, but looking back at the series’ twists, turns, and retcons, there’s something refreshing about how straightforward that original <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-ps2-23rd-anniversary-legacy-1850966714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-ps2-23rd-anniversary-legacy-1850966714">PlayStation 2</a></span> game was. Sora’s debut has issues. It’s a poster child for finicky cameras of the era and the Gummi Ship mini-game is dreadfully dull, but man, remember what it felt like hearing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-utada-hikaru-simple-clean-re-recording-1851490877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-utada-hikaru-simple-clean-re-recording-1851490877">“Simple and Clean”</a></span> for the first time? That ending was the first time a video game made me cry, and the waterworks have not stopped since.</p><p>The original <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is still one of the best deliveries on the Disney crossover concept. As the series has gone on, the Disney worlds have started to feel like an afterthought as Square Enix has prioritized the series’ own lore. But Sora and concepts like the Heartless and Keyblade were so well integrated into those stories that seeing the childlike wonder of that first game fall to the background makes the original game feel like the calm before the storm. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720"><em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> </a></span>seems to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-sora-graphics-tetsuya-nomura-q-1848793366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-sora-graphics-tetsuya-nomura-q-1848793366">expanding this universe even further</a></span>, so it’s unlikely we’ll ever see something this pure out of the series again.</p></div><div><p><em>Birth by Sleep </em>on the PlayStation Portable was a paradigm shift for the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>franchise. The prequel completely recontextualizes everything we know about the universe, all while introducing three new, beloved heroes in Terra, Aqua, and Ventus. <em>Birth by Sleep </em>is a dense, tragic setup for what would come in the years between it and <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, and somehow managed to introduce characters fans have come to love as much as its original trio.</p><p>Even on the PlayStation Portable, <em>Birth by Sleep </em>is a solid recreation of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ spectacle with some interesting accommodations for the handheld’s lack of buttons. It’s also home to some of the best mini-games in the series, which has been fraught territory for <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>over the years. The best parts of it shine even brighter on consoles in the <em>2.5 HD Remix</em> collection.</p></div><div><p>You ever feel like you’re still in search of a high a game made you feel as a child? <em>Kingdom Hearts II </em>is one of those games. To this day, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is the full package of the best parts of the franchise. Soundtrack? 10/10. The action-based combat’s blend of style and substance? Unmatched. The compelling melodrama mixing <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Disney</em>, and the original characters? Imprinted on my soul.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> remains the series’ highest high. It successfully knocks down every pin the first game and <em>Chain of Memories</em> sets up, has memorable Disney worlds like <em>Mulan</em>, <em>Tron</em>, and <em>The Lion King</em> (Sora’s lion transformation is iconic), and also features some incredible action set pieces like the final boss run in which Sora and Riku take down Xemnas. If you grew up with this game like I did, tell me you weren’t thinking of that fight as you were playing the final fight of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>. That shit was unforgettable. But also unforgettable was the debrief between Sora and Riku that follows, in which the series’ two leads finally reach an understanding after three games of being rivals. God, it’s perfect, and leads into a similarly perfect ending.</p><p>There’s probably a universe in which <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>ended after <em>II</em> and was largely remembered as a near-universally beloved action RPG series that escalated into darker, more complex territory in the sequel. Even as it introduces new concepts and characters, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is pretty reasonable as a sequel before every spin-off that followed built <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> into an <em>Avengers</em>-level crossover event. <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is the pinnacle of what the series could have been, and while I’m not mad that it’s continued, I do feel like as the series has gone on, it has gotten less succinct in its themes, mechanics, and the worlds it’s explored. Now that <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> has concluded one story, I guess we’ll see if the series can peel back those layers and scale back to something this pure. But even if it doesn’t, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> is a summation of the best things the franchise has ever done.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/every-free-character-that-you-can-get-in-wuthering-waves-a-free-to-play-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=every-free-character-that-you-can-get-in-wuthering-waves-a-free-to-play-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Choosing to go free-to-play in a gacha game like <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a great option. While the very top-tier content might be rough, you can still play every adventure, mission, and quest without issue.</p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">The truth is that free-to-play games are designed to get some kind of investment out of many of the folks who play them. If you are happy to go on a slow grind and take advantage of all the free resources and items, you can enjoy everything that is available, for free. Will you get your parties to the same overpowered level as those who are willing to pay? It seems unlikely, but you can still have a lot of fun.</p>
 <h2 id="h-all-free-wuthering-waves-characters" data-injectable="false">All free Wuthering Waves characters</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">The main way to get free characters in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is to play through the story. Certain story beats will introduce new characters, and they may end up joining your party for free, giving you your first instance of the character. You can still earn them from pulls, getting additional Resonance Chains or special currencies to spend on other things.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rover (Spectro)</h3> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Rover is the main protagonist of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and at the start of the game, you will need to pick between a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-pick-the-male-or-female-rover-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male or female version</a> of the character. The Rover is a pretty solid starting character overall who can dish out some good damage but also has solid defense due to strong parrying ability. They are effectively designed to fill in gaps in your party without needing to be the main focus at all. They are someone that you can replace if a better character comes along, but they can definitely get the job done for you. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Chixia (Fusion)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">Chixia is a Fusion character that you will get extremely early in the game. She is ranged and uses her guns to pump out plenty of single-target damage, but will struggle to find quick clears against large groups. I really feel her potential single-target damage will make up for this, giving players a very reliable source of damage to their party. Her parry game is weak, but you can abuse certain Echoes to take advantage of i-frames, and she does come with a dash if you need a get-out-of-jail-free card. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Yangyang (Aero)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="938" data-injectable="true">Yangyang is a Support character that you meet in the Prologue, giving you your first taste of someone who will live off-field. The point of Yangyang is to perform her full combo and then allow you to switch back to your main or sub-DPS, depending on what you need to do. She is actually a very strong character, and effort and resources invested in a Support is rarely wasted. Unless you plan on aiming for Vernia, Yangyang can really act as a solid Support option. The bad news is that she can’t do much to help with damage, so you either take advantage of her ability to group or get little additional benefit out of her rotation.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Baizhi (Glacio)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="574" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Another Support, Baizhi offers a very solid alternative to Yangyang. Truthfully, you will be very happy you have both of them when it comes to Tower runs. Which one you use will depend a lot on your other characters, but Baizhi can offer a fantastic damage buff to the next character you switch to, so keep that in mind. Baizhi slots in very well almost everywhere, so it is a superb gap filler for any awkward Support needs. I would actually recommend you level her before Yangyang, frankly, because she will hold up really well even after you get stronger support options.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Sanhua (Glacio)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="865" data-injectable="true">Sanhua is an excellent sub-DPS because you can drop a load of damage and then switch to a main DPS that has more demanding on-field time. I’d really suggest leaning heavily into her burst damage over worrying too much about basic attacking, as there will be better options available to you for that. You absolutely need to work in some attacks to your rotation, but the real focus with her should be dropping as much nuke as you can, as quickly as you can. She is definitely worth investing in and will pay dividends when those damage numbers start to climb. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Yuanwu (Electro)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">Yuanwu is a default beginner character. He is basic attack-focused, and his damage scales with defense, so he is somewhat low-risk. He uses Gauntlets and will basically punch everything around him. Unfortunately, I feel that I’m going to spend way too much time with Yuanwu, as I think he is a bit weak, but I love his kit and feel. At the end of the day, the game is about having fun, not just making the numbers get bigger.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Those are all the free characters for now, but we will keep this updated as more arrive, hopefully with further story expansion. You will also be able to earn the currency you need to unlock other characters from the Banners, so don’t worry about struggling to build up your teams.</p>
