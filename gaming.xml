                <p>Earlier this month, Walt Disney Pictures became one of the first major studios to launch a lawsuit against a leading AI company. Disney and Comcast are both going after Midjourney in court over alleged misappropriation of the studios' respective copyrighted materials. However, there's now a report that Disney is negotiating a potential partnership with OpenAI.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-22/inside-disney-s-campaign-to-protect-darth-vader-from-ai?srnd=homepage-europe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Disney "isn't interested in licensing its full library to anyone," but it is following in the footsteps of YouTube, The Atlantic, and Vox Media regarding a possible deal with OpenAI. The report also notes that Disney approached the other major studios and streamers about joining the lawsuit against Midjourney, which is a considerably smaller company than OpenAI. But Comcast was reportedly the only studio to accept the offer because the others had "different priorities." Regardless, Disney has hinted that the Midjourney case may be just the beginning for the company's legal fight over AI.</p><p>"[The lawsuit] is part of a campaign to protect our intellectual property rights in the world of generative AI," explained Disney lawyer Horacio Gutierrez while speaking with Bloomberg. "This is our first case, but it likely won’t be the last."</p><p>Disney hasn't been entirely opposed to AI in the recent past. The studio recently lent out an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI-powered Darth Vader to Fortnite</a> that recreated the voice of the late actor James Earl Jones. AI remains one of the prevailing topics in the world of gaming as well. Frontier Development recently faced a backlash over generative AI in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3/" data-ref-id="5000-629003">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>, which led the company to reverse course <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-will-no-longer-use-generative-ai-following-backlash/1100-6532675/" data-ref-id="1100-6532675">and remove it from the game</a>. Meanwhile, Nintendo veteran Masahiro Sakurai suggested that AAA video game development is becoming unsustainable, and predicts that AI may be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">help companies work more efficiently</a>.</p>

                <p>Fashion shows typically feature a runway of interesting--but unwearable for the general masses--art, but it looks like video game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/">The Alters</a> is ready to invade that space. Hot off the game's release earlier this month, 11 bit studios and ZA/UM Atelier have announced that a limited collection of apparel inspired by the sci-fi survival game will be featured during Paris Fashion Week. Best of all, this clothing is now available to preorder.</p><p>Fans of the game can pick up three items: <a href="https://evolve-pr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/25Rmh9ifSgtfKzNsXApXXWiG9TrmI0me1cZnS0bjLJw935DqjlwFtWO5ku9C29kNXmvKdjmA_u8gqapA-lB62CdoV4hfPYifBA9lXDI2qt2NjQjPeuj8o4-esfmhMseawpu7b_dQBzfSr3GYwb3zunBP5GVStl3Ll1DY9i9VZsuHTPTCOuRnbHWQiRygnVwLx70aXemV1u1HZJ2pDvveR6uxg3hW2aPgYAOhfiQ" rel="nofollow ">Jan Dolski's mission jacket</a>, <a href="https://evolve-pr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2bv9pXq28jtTdoKU5B8koHx_ueMOTNQJjCMr27IZCNBmS5DqjlwGPhrjjaIpGlMbaPOmAZY5z_ufhfIQQskObvtZaj0KT2HU-_1oyyoJd4wIkkW4hOoBaJsKybXyYpbCCaTQRsjs83mpL7pXw7K19oJHxFVlNAS5DBHWbhhjXw0PxRBF6PjWVU54itoxbzC7E0lS5mJvKLHRrKw9bgVsNMnLlRQxqLG7mV708DVx8PIVW" rel="nofollow ">utility pants</a>, and the <a href="https://evolve-pr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2O5qkPyUhNjj-07H3p1KgLLoljdu4mlC86Ukncs0p7HCX5DqjlwHij-Jow3SHiz7-FdpYKcfu1z6NcVCeXLEDUGDALmeuqYKTgMTuaVGFsbQivLl4x8QjuBYfw5ex2AyCsM-Q9O86ENB8HjvgBvtLVxRqKBXN0Q7gY-zi4qBr5T_eclYlb88lp8Fu-gtAyMkJ6-6GJki3OdlJn0Y5Njtu-g" rel="nofollow ">Dolly Baa-Baag</a>. These all feature the aesthetics of the clothing worn by Dolski in the game, as they combine a loose fit with reflective decals, and vibrant colors--exactly the kind of clothing you want to wear while racing against the clock to stop yourself from getting a lethal dose of solar radiation while stranded on an inhospitable alien rock. The Dolly Baa-Baag is also quite cute, as it references the silent sidekick from the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521299-tracksuit_whole2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521299" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521299-tracksuit_whole2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521299"></a><figcaption>Look good and have an instant cosplay with this look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521299-tracksuit_whole2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521300-dollybaa-baag.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521301-dollybaa-baag_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521302-missionjacket.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521303-missionjacket_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521304-missionutilitypants.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521305-tracksuit_whole.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521300,1300-4521301,1300-4521302,1300-4521303,1300-4521304,1300-4521305" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521300-dollybaa-baag.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521301-dollybaa-baag_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521302-missionjacket.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521303-missionjacket_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521304-missionutilitypants.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4521305-tracksuit_whole.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521300-dollybaa-baag.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521301-dollybaa-baag_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521302-missionjacket.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521303-missionjacket_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521304-missionutilitypants.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4521305-tracksuit_whole.jpg"></figure><p>The clothing is available to purchase through the ZA/UM Atelier store, but the catch here is that it's <em>quite </em>expensive. The mission jacket costs around $460, the utility pants are $230, and the bag is almost $200.</p><p>"The Alters is a game about who we are, and who we might've been. The way we present ourselves to the world--through clothing, expression, or even the smallest personal details--is deeply tied to the lives we live and the choices we make,” said The Alters game director Tomasz Kisilewicz in a press statement. "This collaboration with ZA/UM Atelier felt like a natural extension of that philosophy--an embodiment of identity through design. We can’t wait to see how our community responds to this fusion."</p><p>The Alters is now out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Reviewer Alessandro Barbosa <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-alters-review-seeing-double/1900-6418373/">gave the game an 8/10 score</a>, noting that The Alters "is an engrossing survival adventure" that delicately nails the balance between self-reflection and base-management gameplay.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Game Release Window Update</p>
      </div>
<p>When reaching out to The Chinese Room's parent company Sumo Digital about the cuts, Game Developer also discovered that a number of employees have been cut from Sumo's communications team. Sumo Digital announced it would be restructuring earlier this year, as part of a plan to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sumo-group-ditching-original-franchises-to-focus-exclusively-on-co-development-work" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pivot away from original projects</a> entirely to focus on co-development work. Sumo also cut 15% of its total global workforce in an earlier round of layoffs this time last year.</p><p>The Chinese Room are currently in the final stages of work on long-awaited sequel Bloodlines 2, which has been delayed and interrupted multiple times now. Most recently the game's release window was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october/1100-6530367/" data-ref-id="1100-6530367">delayed to October</a>, with the game's executive producer saying the game was already finished, but in need of more work to fix bugs and improve stability.</p><p>The Chinese Room took over development of the title in 2021, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-lead-developers-replaced/1100-6487923/" data-ref-id="1100-6487923">Paradox reassigned the game</a> from its original developer Hardsuit Labs, and insiders say the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/" data-ref-id="1100-6497078">almost didn't survive</a> the transition between studios.</p><p>Despite layoffs at The Chinese Room, Bloodlines 2 will still release as planned, a Paradox spokesperson has said in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release," the statement said. "We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like in the first entry in the series, there's a very good reason why killing people in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is not a very smart idea. Following the cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding, the spirits of the dead have started roaming the world of the living, manifesting themselves as Beached Things, or BTs for short. Every time one of these beings manages to consume a human, a massive explosion that annihilates everything in its vicinity, called a voidout, occurs.</p>
<p>As such, the game makes it abundantly clear right from the onset how going for non-lethal options when dealing with human enemies like MULEs is the way to go to be able to defend oneself without having to deal with the terrible consequences of a voidout. However, if you really want to, there's a way to unlock some lethal weapon options as soon as Sam's new adventure begins in Mexico.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250625114400-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Every weapon in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach with an MP designation can be turned into a lethal weapon from the weapon wheel menu</strong>. Hold the right direction button to bring up the menu, select an MP weapon on the main weapons tab, and<strong> press and hold the right and left triggers as well as the O button</strong>. As soon as you do, you will see a little animation play out in the circle surrounding the weapon, and once the animation has played out, the weapon will have turned lethal and can be used to kill human enemies. This little trick is revealed in-game for the first time after delivering to the pizza chief a few hours in, but you don't have to wait to complete this delivery, as the option of turning most weapons lethal is active right from the start of the game. Do note, however, that not every weapon can be used to kill enemies, as weapons that are specified to use rubber bullets or tranquillizer rounds cannot be rendered lethal, no matter what.</p>

            <p>I'm sure Supermassive are going to do a perfectly respectable job with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. But, when there's two games coming out, one of which looks like a pitch-perfect spiritual sequel by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>' creators in the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reanimals">Reaminal</a>, and the other is an <em>eh</em>-looking numbered affair by a different, talented but wildly inconsistent studio, it's hard not to pick favourites. Nonetheless, Little Nightmares 3 is out on October 10th. Here's a trailer. It's too bright. Grumble.</p>

<p>Also on the same date is an enhanced edition of the original Little Nightmares (RTX, 60 FPS, 4K). In the most galaxy brained bit of publisher grasping I've encountered in some time, the actual game is fully playable right now, but only if you pre-order Little Nightmares 3. Otherwise, you can wait until October with the rest of the joyless cynics who don't want to learn about games exclusively from the people trying to sell them, before making a purchase. What are they like, eh?</p>
<p>Little Nightmares 3 itself features full co-op, although you can play solo with an AI companion. Adam Smith (RPS in peace) and Alice Bell (RPS in <a href="https://www.bookbeat.com/ro/book/the-grapples-of-wrath-1654023">new book out next year)</a> both enjoyed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-review-pc">two</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-2-review">games</a> for their "extraordinary views and grubby little rooms" (Adam) and "childhood authority figures stretched and pulled to grotesque extremes like chewing gum" (Alice).</p>
<p>Dedicated Nightheads may want to watch the entirety of <a href="https://youtu.be/oa85Ns7uegc">this week's series showcase</a>, which also included announcements for a new season of podcast The Sounds of Nightmares, a comic book named Descent To Nowhere in October, and "young adult novel" Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones out in September.</p>
<p>Here's a<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmare-studios-reanimal-is-a-creepy-co-op-adventure-inspired-by-wind-waker-and-silent-hill-2"> hands-off preview with Tarsier's (Little Nightmares I&amp;II) Reanimal</a>, which is inspired by both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, according to narrative director David Mervik.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The bald man always hungers for more folks to drown in toilet water, so IO Interactive have kept feeding their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> a steady stream of post-launch targets with each entry in the World of Assassination trilogy. It sounds the devs'll be taking a similar approach with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, albeit with some Bondy twists.</p>
<p>The question is, would such regular updates scratch the itch of folks who're in it for the long haul as effectively as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jean-claude-van-damme-is-coming-to-hitman-this-week-as-a-double-crossing-ica-agent-and-its-free-to-play-for-a-month">elusive targets</a> Agent 47's been taking out on a regular basis?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>IO boss Hakan Abrak teased this being one of the "learnings from World of Assassination" that the studio may be applying to Bond in a chat with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets">The Game Business</a>. </p>
<p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," Abrak said when asked whether First Light will follow the post-launch plan the past three Hitman games have ridden to long-term success.</p>
<p>He was keen not to get into too much detail, emphasising that IO are focused on nailing what the game has to offer at launch first, but did go on to say the following:</p>
<blockquote>With Bond, we have really upped our stealth, we have really evolved the action aspects of our technology and features. Seamless combat, coming in and out of range and melee… For Hitman, it was interlocked animations, here it is freeform. We have [players] driving different exotic cars. That gives us more challenges to play with. In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond.</blockquote>
<p>While a lot of that is just Abrak oulining <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">the differences between how Bond and Hitman will play</a> that IO have been chatting about since the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">revealed</a>, it's the last bit that's got my attention. Hitman's elusive targets are all generally slightly different twists on the 'go somewhere, prep to kill someone, kill someone, get out' formula that the games have refined into a lethal art, with twists like no saving or restarting to spice up the challenge.</p>
<p>With Bond looking like it's much less intensely focused on just eliminating certain people, I'll be keen to see how expansive the extra challenges it offers are. I can see the likes of car chases or more straight-up shootouts being part of the equation, much like they are in the base game. Will we get longer missions that chain a number of these elements together as post-launch extras, will IO opt to just add them as individual challenges so it can drop new stuff more often, or a mix of both?</p>
<p>I'd prefer the former, but it might not be as efficient development-wise as the elusive targets have proven to be - something Abrak notes IO are so keen on that they've stopped making as many new toilets in their games. Plus, we'll have to see if the Bond formula, with its glitzy Hollywood sheen in contrast to Hitman's darkly hilarious murder experimentation, lends itself as well to keeping a game feeling fresh once that initial surge of interest runs its course.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-sounds-like-itll-be-getting-hitman-style-post-launch-missions-but-with-more-actiony-things]]></content:encoded>

<p>Company is now offering replacements for all customers</p>

<figure><a title="Dbrand" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fc56ae4287071/dbrand.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Dbrand has admitted that its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">initial response to the Joy-Con detachment debacle</a> surrounding its new 'Killswitch' product was "spectacularly terrible".</p>
<p>If you're unaware, the Killswitch came under fire for supposedly causing the Switch 2's Joy-Con to detach from the console too easily when applied. Dbrand had attempted to defend this by laying out the conditions under which the detachment might occur, ultimately stating that "nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this".</p>
<p>Fans understandably took this to mean that Dbrand was shirking responsibility and shifting the blame to the users. It's not taken long for the company to catch wind of this, and so it has now issued an updated response on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dbrand-is-sending-improved-switch-2-grips-to-all-customers-after-spectacularly-terrible-response-to-detaching-claims/">VGC</a>) in which it finally takes full responsibility while offering replacements to all customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After reading through your feedback, it’s quite clear that our post was a spectacularly terrible response to the issue at hand. Some of you have expressed that opinion in a perfectly reasonable way. Others have expressed it with literal death threats."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dbrand goes on to say that while it still believes detachment would only occur under certain conditions, it ultimately agrees that this shouldn't necessarily matter, and that users should be able to hold the console and Killswitch in whatever manner they see fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As easy as it is to boil our original post down to <em>“you’re holding it wrong,”</em> what we’re sober to now is the point that <em>you should be allowed to hold it however the f*** you want, without detachment occurring.</em> We get it. Please continue dunking on us for the next six to eight months for reincarnating Steve Jobs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company is currently looking at two potential solutions for the issue: the first is a complete redesign of the accessory that would theoretically completely resolve any potential detachment issues. Dband is not 100% certain that this option would be feasible to mass-produce at this time, but it is nevertheless giving it a shot.</p>
<p>The second is simply an improved version of the current product, which would still prove to be a lot more reliable than some of the products currently in users' hands. Whichever option Dbrand ultimately opts for will be communicated in a new update on <strong>10th July 2025</strong>. Regardless, everyone – whether you encountered the detachment issue or not – will be getting a replacement product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What we are 100% committed to is getting everyone replacement Joy-Cons ASAP, regardless of whether they’re severely affected, haven’t experienced the issue, have emailed us a dozen times, or have no clue about any of this."</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display has been bashed a few times already since the console's release earlier this month, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB67B8LCorI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest analysis from Monitor Unboxed</a> is perhaps even more damning. We already knew of the nearly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-existent HDR capabilities</a> and of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variable Refresh Rate issues</a>, but Monitor Unboxed, which regularly reviews PC displays, has now measured the screen's response time, and the results are really disappointing.</p>
<p>While the channel couldn't perform testing with their usual tools for monitors, they manually conducted a series of 20 gray-to-gray transitions to measure the response time of the Nintendo Switch 2 display set to 60Hz (as there are no current games that support the maximum 120Hz). The test's average was 33 milliseconds, which makes the screen far slower than typical PC monitors that range between 6 and 20 milliseconds. What's even more surprising, though, is that the display is around 50% slower even than the original Nintendo Switch, which measured 21 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Monitor Unboxed postulates that one of the reasons behind this underwhelming measurement could be the lack of Overdrive technology, which is pretty much mandatory on most displays nowadays but would require higher voltage, which, in turn, would affect the device's overall battery life, a critical feature of a handheld console. This is especially important for the Nintendo Switch 2 since it already comes with a larger display (7.9 inches versus 6.2), a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p), and higher brightness (430 nits versus 310 nits) compared to the original Nintendo Switch, all of which impact the battery life.</p>
<p>Because the display's response time is approximately twice the 16.7 ms frame interval at 60 Hz, it cannot fully update before the next refresh. This results in persistent blur trails and poor motion clarity, as seen in the <a href="https://www.testufo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blur Busters UFO test</a> performed in the video. Furthermore, Monitor Unboxed reckons that the 120 Hz capability will not significantly improve motion since the panel cannot keep up with the faster refresh cycles anyway.</p>
<p>The only real solution to this issue will be an OLED Nintendo Switch 2 display, which will inevitably offer far superior response times (and, therefore, motion clarity), not to mention greatly superior contrast, which will also improve the console's mediocre HDR representation. Meanwhile, pretty much the only upside to the current LCD screen (other than the aforementioned improvements) compared to the original Switch is its far better wide color gamut support, which covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color space, up from the 79% of the previous console.</p>
<p>Despite all these shortcomings, the console is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling like hotcakes</a>, proving that most of Nintendo's user base doesn't really care about such topics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rematch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap's newly launched football action title - has dribbled and passed its way to an impressive player and sales milestone, less than one week since the game's debut.</p>
<p>The game has surpassed 1m sales since its release. What's more, the studio also announced Rematch has already reached three million "unique" players since its launch on 19th June, thanks to it being available on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>. </p>
<p>Those three million players have played 11.8m matches, while 55.6m goals have been scored. That number will likely be getting higher even as I type, given that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">over on Steam</a> there are currently still 19,008 footy fans kicking about in the game.</p>

<p>Additionally, Slocap said there have been 33.5m assists in Rematch, and 69 (nice).1m saves. "This is just the beginning," <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1937571625752236446">Slocap wrote</a>, celebrating the latest Rematch numbers. "Thank you for being with us, in and out of the pitch!"</p>
<p>While it has undeniably had a successful debut, one thing missing from Rematch currently is crossplay. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/adding-crossplay-to-rematch-is-our-absolute-highest-priority-says-sloclap">Sloclap said adding crossplay was its"absolute highest priority"</a>.</p>
<p>"We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress," the studio said at the time.</p>

<p>Our Tom is one of those three million Rematch players, and he has been having a good old time with it. He does wish, however, that fellow Rematch players learn one important thing: passing the ball.</p>
<p>"I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>With Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3’s release, the finale of what has been a wonderful pet project (pun intended) for CyberConnect2 is finally here. Throwing a group of cartoon children into the horrors of a war loosely based upon World War II was a bold choice, but it has spawned a trilogy of hopeful stories of survival against insurmountable odds. Here, with the final title, the developers round off this tale set in the Little Tail Bronx universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 - Official Trailer  #Fuga3 #FugaMelodiesOfSteel3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/If5Lzf_M9KU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Kicking off with what are honestly the most harrowing scenes of the series, Fuga 3 settles into its core narrative, after some obligatory time travel shenanigans. Malt, the leader of the children, is abducted by the Berman Empire, who are gearing up for another invasion of Gasco. The remaining children are drawn to the Taranis, a gigantic tank that we last saw falling through the sea of clouds in Fuga 2. Once aboard, they set out through Gasco to rescue Malt, stop the Berman Empire and topple the villainous Kaiser.</p>


<p>Returning from Fuga 2 is the ability from the start to view summaries of the entire story so far, so you don’t even need to play the previous titles to follow the narrative of this title. I would still recommend playing the others, as it gives a better understanding of how the core mechanics of these games work. It also impresses upon the player the relationship between the characters and makes the harsher elements of the story hit all the harder. But I ain’t your keeper, so do what you want.</p>


<p>The gameplay here is largely the same as the previous titles, with all the turn-based strategy and life-sim elements you’ve come to expect. Once again, you’ll be blowing holes in tanks of steadily increasing size and power, capitalising on their weaknesses to delay their turns. If you find yourself right up against it, the Soul Cannon still allows you to use the soul and life of one of the children to win any battle, which is especially grim when, in the downtime between battles, you’re performing tasks on the Taranis to aid you in future battles from farming, to cooking, to simply chatting with the kids.</p>
<p>Performing these tasks during the Intermission segments provides bonuses like improving the relationships between the children, which unlocks powerful new attacks, and eating specifically grants your entire team buffs for the upcoming battles. Returning from previous games is the Notebook&nbsp;that lists the specific activities&nbsp;the children want to do, which grants substantial EXP boosts and raises their spirits for future battles.</p>

<p>With this being the epic conclusion of the trilogy, the battles have been buffed to an incredible sheen. On top of all the mechanics of previous games, CyberConnect2 has worked to provide interplay between – and additions to – the existing gameplay of the series. The best addition that develops on the existing mechanics is that Leader Skills can now be performed by all of the children instead of just Malt. Although these can’t be chosen as actions, they activate in response to what is happening in the battle, so their timing is often absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>The first of the new mechanics of Fuga 3 is the Combo Chance, which allows you to chain hits against enemy weaknesses to multiply the damage of your next hit. It caps at 200%, but believe me that a double damage cannon blast will absolutely get the job done. This instils a more dynamic use of switching the children around at far more regular intervals than the previous games and it also resulted in me using children in battle that I rarely used in the first two games, like Wappa or Chick.</p>
<p>The second new mechanic builds on the wealth of characters from the series outside of the core cast&nbsp;to provide Assist Attacks. Based on your decisions in the game at key narrative points, you can unlock the ability to bring in specific characters to support you with a variety of features from wiping out enemy armour to increasing the defence of the Taranis. Then, during the gameplay, you can land on Transmission Events, where these support players request conversations with specific characters on the Taranis to increase the potency of their Assist Attacks.</p>

<p>These are great additions, but the third new mechanic that doesn’t land quite as well for me. Hitting weaknesses builds a gauge ending in a cute little pixel heart. The moment you hit that heart, a very powerful attack will activate automatically, which is where my problem with it lies. You have no easy way to manipulate this, so this attack is often wasted. It’s not a dealbreaker, of course, but when all the other mechanics blend in so well, it’s disappointing to have one that doesn’t fit into an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Visually, Fuga 3 is much the same as the previous games, employing the same beautiful watercolour artstyle and showing developments of the characters through small changes to their visual design. There are subtle changes, such as the attack effects looking far more flashy than previous titles, but otherwise this is the same Fuga. This isn’t a bad thing, as they nailed the visuals (and the sound for that matter) from the first game in my opinion, so more of the same is an excellent thing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ruffy and the Riverside Review - Swapping Spree]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ruffy-and-riverside-review-swapping-spree</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-swapping-spree.1227690/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>is a 3D platformer in which you play as a bear and his diminutive flying companion. Together, you must explore a series of semi-linear environments, searching for collectibles and meeting the world's wacky but lovable inhabitants.</p>

<p>If all of this is starting to sound familiar, it's because you've played&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>&nbsp;or its sequel&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, and that's a comparison&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>developer Zockrates Laboratories is eager to encourage. There's even a little nod to the bear and bird in one of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy</em>'s secret areas.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>isn't just a <i>Banjo&nbsp;</i>knockoff (a&nbsp;<em>Banjo&nbsp;</em>riff, if you will). It's got a rather clever and unique central mechanic that differentiates it from its closest inspirations, and that's just enough to elevate it above mere homage, even while certain elements grate.</p>

<h2><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Offers Fun Throwback 3D Platforming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-beach.jpg?itok=DCyYEYo0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-beach.jpg?itok=Cf_GA7Yf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's plenty of 3D platforming fun to be had in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>is a 3D collectathon platformer that has you combing large, semi-open areas for various goodies. It's very much in the spirit of its forebears (no pun intended); you'll feel right at home here if you're a fan of the aforementioned <i>Banjo&nbsp;</i>games, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow"><em>Spyro the Dragon</em></a>.</p>

<p>As a 3D platformer,&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>works perfectly well. Its controls are solid, its levels are packed with things to see and do, and it's got plenty of wacky offbeat characters to enjoy as well.</p>

<p>The central hub, the titular Riverside, is probably where you'll be spending most of your time when it comes to hunting for secrets and sidequest objectives. It boasts that all-important "ooh, what's that?" factor; you'll be chasing down one sidequest, then you'll get hopelessly sidetracked by other quests and ambient puzzles.</p>

<p>It's all wrapped up in a charming papercraft aesthetic that calls to mind Nintendo's RPG classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-version-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct" rel="nofollow"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, as well as descendants like&nbsp;<em>Bug Fables</em>. It's big, colorful, and simple, which is exactly how games like this should look.</p>

<h2>Swapping in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Works Well</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-puzzle.jpg?itok=nBhH7AJ1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-puzzle.jpg?itok=Kx6zoTcO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Swapping leads to some fun puzzles in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>'s puzzles are driven by its core swap mechanic, which is nice and simple. Some objects have textures you can swap with others. That's pretty much it, but it's the driving engine behind some pretty clever and fun challenges.</p>

<p>For instance, you might come across a weight that's too heavy to lift, so you'll need to swap its current stone texture with a wooden one to allow you to move it out of your way. Alternatively, to get the upper hand in a race, you may need to swap water with mud that will slow your rivals down.</p>

<p>While the number of textures you can swap is limited - you cannot, for instance, steal the texture of a brick wall, or of a living creature - you can swap most objects' colors, and some puzzles call for you to do just that. It's fun to play around with textures to solve puzzles, but it's also fun just to experiment with swapping on your own.</p>

<p>Swapping also forms the basis of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>'s all-too-brief boss battles, and while I don't want to spoil, suffice it to say the mechanic is used in some pretty interesting ways to help Ruffy defeat his foes. You'll pretty much never just be punching bosses to death here.</p>

<h2><em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>Won't Shut Up</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-dialogue.jpg?itok=D97cxbl3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-dialogue.jpg?itok=WbpJ0zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is just one of way, way too many dialogue lines in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, while the collectathon and swapping elements of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>work well, there's one area where it decisively stumbles, and that's the story. You might think the narrative in a game like this isn't particularly important, but sadly, that's an opinion Zockrates Laboratories doesn't seem to share.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, none of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>'s characters will shut up. One line of dialogue will never suffice; every conversation drags on interminably, with characters often repeating sentiments or concepts, presumably to check you haven't fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Narratively speaking, your quest is to save Riverside and its surroundings from a giant evil cube called Groll. There's no real depth or complexity beyond that setup; Groll bad, your team good, beat up cube to win.</p>

<p><em>Ruffy</em>'s story isn't particularly deep or interesting, and its dialogue isn't terribly amusing either, although I did get one or two chuckles out of some of the more left-field jokes. On the whole, though, there's really no need for the story to take center stage like this.</p>

<h2>Story Often Dictates Exploration in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-story-puzzle.jpg?itok=lYU9WHNT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ruffy-and-the-riverside-review-story-puzzle.jpg?itok=fwjRELr8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't look so happy, Ruffy. There's literally no point in you being in here.</figcaption></figure><p>The suffocating presence of the story proves to be a problem in the exploration elements of&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside&nbsp;</em>as well. All too often, I'd be wandering around Riverside, looking for puzzles I could solve, when I'd happen upon a particularly interesting conundrum.</p>

<p>I'd spend a few minutes trying to work out how to solve said head-scratcher, before mentally filing it under "return later" and being distracted by a passing collectible. Upon progressing the story, I'd then discover this was a puzzle I literally couldn't solve until the narrative gave me what I needed.</p>

<p>This proved extremely frustrating, and it stopped me from wanting to explore levels; after all, why try to solve puzzles when there's no reason to believe I've got all the pieces? In fairness, there are still many optional areas and challenges waiting for you in&nbsp;<em>Ruffy and the Riverside</em>, but those roadblocks are too numerous to fully relax.</p>

			<p>It's game over for Hytale, the long-awaited Minecraft-style sandbox game, and its studio, Hypixel. The news was <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> this week on the game's official website, where Director Aaron Donaghey wrote:</p>
<p><em>Game development is brutally hard - especially when you’re trying to build something original that speaks to a creative, passionate community. Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</em></p>
<p>The game was going to be set in a procedurally generated fantasy world featuring RPG-style combat and dungeons. Of course, as you'd expect in a Minecraft-inspired game, there would also be block-based construction and mods. Hytale would have been published by Riot Games, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Hypixel Studios in April 2020. In the cancellation letter, Hypixel thanked Riot for their support of the personnel following this transition:</p>
<p><em>We’re also deeply grateful to Riot - not just for the years of support and the opportunities they gave us, but for the care they’re showing our team during this transition. They supported us in going out into the world to see if there were investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward. And now, as we begin winding things down, they’re ensuring our team is supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next. It’s not just thoughtful - it’s human. And it shows a genuine effort to take care of the people behind the work.</em></p>
<p>The original Hypixel server in Minecraft is not affected and will remain operational.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Palworld x Terraria update has launched, bringing fishing, salvaging, bigger towns, a Pal trust mechanic and more in one of the biggest patches the game has seen since its early access release last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update v0.6.0 adds the collaboration with Terraria, Re-Logic’s hugely popular sandbox game. It includes a unique dungeon featuring enemies from Terraria, and the ability to collect materials in the dungeon to create equipment from the world of the game. The Moon Lord, a boss from Terraria, is now a raid boss in Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Terraria content is just one part of the update itself. Not only are there PlayStation 5 dedicated servers, but a number of new features. These include fishing, a salvage system, three new types of islands, a Pal trust mechanic, and the level cap raising from 60 to 65. All that and more is detailed in the patch notes, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld developer Pocketpair continues to release major updates to the game even as it battles Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent lawsuit. And the lawsuit has affected the game. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-says-its-being-forced-to-patch-the-game-due-to-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-lawsuit"><u>Pocketpair admitted that recent patches made changes to the game that were forced upon it as a result of the ongoing litigation</u></a>. As you’d perhaps expect, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-modders-are-restoring-mechanics-pocketpair-was-forced-to-patch-out-due-to-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-patent-lawsuit">modders stepped in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC early 2024, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. The companies want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</u></a>. We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusation it used generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld: Tides of Terraria update 0.6.0 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>▼Terraria Collab!<br>・Terraria Dungeon<br>⤷ A unique dungeon featuring enemies from Terraria has been added!

<p>This bumps it from 1.0.0 up to <strong>Version 1.0.1</strong>. According to the official patch notes, it resolves multiple issues to enhance the overall gameplay experience. It we find out what exactly is going on behind the scenes with this update, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>"Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience."</p>

<hr>
<p>Whether we'll see this game get any significant content updates in the future is unclear at this stage, but at the moment, it seems Nintendo will at least be patching any issues discovered.</p>
<p>This follows an update for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last week. Nintendo has also rolled out some Switch game updates today for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Welcome Tour on the Switch 2 yet, you can check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We actually thought it was surprisingly delightful.</p>

Prices are down, panic-buying has cooled, and both duelists and collectors are feeling the benefits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But make no mistake, there are still plenty of premium pulls hidden in Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 releases. Between <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OGB8?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Supreme Darkness</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xpqW?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alliance Insight</a>, we've seen the final wave of Quarter Century Secret Rares. And just this past week, Starlight Rares officially returned to the TCG, turning heads and inflating wishlists overnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, since we're halfway through 2025, I've been busy taking stock of the most valuable cards you can still pull from Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 boosters. It's time to d-d-d-duel!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10. Mulcharmy Purulia</strong></h3><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223410"><div id="223410" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mulcharmy Purulia</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This reprint of Mulcharmy Purulia is pretty pricey these days, reaching around $100 right now after its printing in Maxze of the Master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has started to level off, but it was a sharp climb just a couple of months ago.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9. Mitsurugui Ritual </strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223411"><div id="223411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mitsurugui Ritual </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $90 at the time of asking, this spell card is a dream for reptile-focused decks. The Supreme Darkness Quarter Century Super Rare version has recently dropped from $120 to $90, but it’s still expensive.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8. Maiden of White</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223412"><div id="223412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maiden of White</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you managed to grab the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbJWb?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue-Eyes White Destiny</a> structure deck, then good news – many of its cards are pretty pricey to get these days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maiden of White is going for around $90-100 right now, with first editions climbing to the $120s.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7.

That art is gorgeous, and it’s going for around $100 on the secondary market (although some are asking for more).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Maliss P March Hare</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223414"><div id="223414" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maliss P March Hare</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It never takes long for Yu-Gi-Oh cards to devolve into made-up words and random letters, but this one is worth checking your packs for. In fact, it’s the most valuable Secret Rare from this year’s Alliance Insight set.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. Dragon Master Lords</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223415"><div id="223415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Master Lords</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A 5000 attack and defense creature that can’t be targeted by card effects?

<figure><a title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/764edeb67c52e/super-smash-bros-ultimate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, bumping the Switch game up to Version 13.0.4.</p>
<p>This appears to resolve a few minor issues tied to offline and online play. There was one issue with Mii Fighters that's now been solved and online Switch 2 and Switch connections have been fixed. Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Ver. 13.0.4 (Released 24th June 2025)</h3>
<h6>Offline</h6>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in which thumbnail images displaying Mii Fighters would sometimes not be generated correctly when creating or modifying a Mii Fighter and saving it in Games &amp; More.</li>

<p>The following issues have been fixed in Nintendo Switch 2 system version 20.1.5, released on June 18, 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a Nintendo Switch 2 player and a Nintendo Switch player were matched up in online play, the match may have ended immediately if someone was using a Mii Fighter.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo originally acknowledged this update following the Switch 2's system firmware update last week. It's also been working on resolving more issues tied to Switch backwards compatibility over the past month.</p>
<p>Apart from Smash Ultimate, Nintendo has also updated the Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> today, bumping it up to Version 1.4.1. According to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27783/kw/super%20mario%20odyssey">official patch notes for this one</a>, several issues have been addressed to improve the overall gameplay experience on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>This venue features multiple historical exhibits, eight interactive experiences, a shop where you can purchase merchandise and much more. Now to add to this, the museum will be opening an art gallery.</p>
<p>The museum's official social media account has also confirmed this art gallery will be opening later this year on <strong>3rd September 2025</strong> on the second floor of the exhibition building.</p>

            <p>
There's some bad-ish news if you've been eagerly awaiting developer Nightdive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remaster on consoles. The studio has been forced to delay the remaster's PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch release, but - good-ish news time - only by a couple of weeks as it seeks to remedy undisclosed "issues".
</p>
<p>
Nightdive announced it would be remastering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>, but it wasn't until earlier this year that the project got a new name (it's now officially known as the System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster) and a 26th June release date for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, the studio has now announced a short delay for the console versions in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nightdivestudios.bsky.social/post/3lsclg2v6o22p">statement on social media</a>, saying it has "encountered issues that have prevented us from launching System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster on consoles... on 26th June as originally intended." Nightdive adds that it's "currently working to address these issues as quickly as possible", but that the console release is now "targeting the first two weeks of July."

<p>
As for the PC version, that's managed to retain its 26th June release date and will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a> on 26th June as originally announced. "We'll update everyone as soon as we have a set launch date for consoles," Nightdive's statement concludes.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, which follows on from 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.
</p>
<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2 released in the hazy days of 1999, taking players onboard the FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114 for another battle of wits with rogue AI SHODAN. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," Nightdive explains. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!), "It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced... and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."

            <link>https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-star-kai-cenat-really-wants-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-to-get-police-to-apologize-for-taking-his-friend%E2%80%99s-car.1227552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a meeting of the minds that is shocking only in its capacity to surprise anyone at this point, current and <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon-to-be-former</a> <a href="https://defector.com/the-most-unbelievable-bits-from-nyc-mayor-eric-adamss-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced NYC mayor</a> Eric Adams recently sat down with Kai Cenat, one of the most-watched streamers on Twitch and probably the most famous from a mainstream perspective. The latter, a Bronx native, attempted to host an in-person PS5 giveaway in 2023, which – to give you an idea of how that went – has its own Wikipedia page titled “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Union_Square_riot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Union Square riot</a>.” Now, fresh off the success of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/kai-cenat-streamer-university-what-happened.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamer University’s more contained chaos</a> and on the verge of hosting another giveaway, Cenat has some misgivings about how the NYPD treated him and his friends.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxwcFDYKoL8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> promoting the upcoming second giveaway, Cenat asked Adams how he could avoid another disastrous outcome. After the two exchanged pleasantries – with Adams granting that every day in New York is “crazy,” <a href="https://defector.com/eric-adams-the-beauty-of-new-york-is-that-there-are-terrorist-attacks-and-also-stores-that-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as is his wont</a> – Cenat, who until recently resided in Atlanta, Georgia and has since departed for another undisclosed city, explained why he got the sense that he’s no longer welcome in NYC. In short, Cenat feels like the police continued to bother him and his friends even in 2024, after the 2023 riot incident was resolved.</p><p>"[NYPD] be picking on us in a way,” Cenat told Adams, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/30/new-york-city-council-criminal-justice-reform-bills-00138644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a notoriously pro-cop mayor</a> who was once an NYPD captain himself. “In terms of a lot of times where police was doing things that they wasn't supposed to be doing. It made it feel like NYPD was a gang at one point. My friend [Roberto] Fanum [Gonzalez] got his car taken away for no reason [in 2024]."</p><p>Adams then asked if the NYPD impounded the car on the same day as the riot, to which Cenat replied that it had happened on "a whole different day." The incident Cenat described was, indeed, alarming, with an officer <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/alex-ocho/fanum-lamborghini-seized-gun-pointed-nypd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing a gun at Gonzalez</a> after last summer's Bronx Dominican Parade and handcuffing him. Police proceeded to take the car, a purple Lamborghini Urus, on the basis that, as a rep later told Complex, the vehicle lacked license plates. However, Gonzalez claimed on social media that he'd received a permit for the purposes of the parade. Additionally, pictures surfaced that seemed to depict <a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1817726076715753556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officers posing with the car</a>.</p><p>“The police would just look at us and pick us out,” Cenat told Adams. “We had trouble the whole summer [of 2024]. … I kinda feel like coming to New York, it’ll be kinda hectic in terms of, I gotta move a certain way.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response, Adams suddenly brought up one of the handful of things <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-mayor-adams-rats-99649a7a4ec4003e8ec5ca551d90ed25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s declared</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/eric-adams-nyc-trash-wheelie-bins-b2576182.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">war on</a> during his time as mayor: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mayor-eric-adams-drill-rap-1299108/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drill rap</a>.</p><p>"We've come a long way from where we were,” Adams said, never clarifying which time period he was referring to. “And what's happening now even in the Bronx, there's a lot of crews, a lot of folks getting into battles over drill music. They're disrespecting each others' community. And so, I have to find that right balance. I've got to make sure we're safe, but not with disgrace."</p><p>“Yeah,” replied Cenat, “I just feel like there were some points where, you know, it’ll be the cops taking the car and posing with it, and we’re basically getting laughed at. So, us being from New York, we felt some type of way in terms of, like, we can’t even embrace the city without something going on because of how big we are. We always have a radar every time we fly in. It was always something.”</p><p>Of the car incident, Adams then asked the question on everybody’s mind: “What did [police] take it for? Was he drag racing?”</p><p>Cenat, perhaps more prepared for Adams’ jazz-like stream-of-consciousness approach to conversation than Adams – who loves putting on a show but hates doing his homework – was for anything involving Cenat and his friends, somehow did not miss a beat: “No,” he said, “he wasn’t doing nothing.”</p><p>“OK,” Adams finally resolved, “we need to look at that.”</p><p>Cenat and Adams’ discussion of the 2023 riot and the upcoming giveaway was comparatively brief. The riot, which took place in August 2023, stemmed from a comedy of errors. Cenat and fellow mega-famous content creators like Gonzalez and Duke Dennis failed to obtain a permit for a gathering that ended up drawing thousands, who grew increasingly unruly as what was billed as PS5 giveaway collapsed under its own weight. A small handful of fans were injured, and 65 were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews/post/influencer-kai-cenat-playstation-giveaway-riot-new-york-charges-have-now-been-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a>. Police yanked Cenat out of the ensuing chaos and hit him with charges of inciting a riot and unlawful assembly, though the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/07/us/kai-cenat-union-square-giveaway-riot-charge-dropped" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charges were dropped</a> after Cenat paid $55,000 in restitution fees and <a href="https://people.com/twitch-star-kai-cenat-wont-face-charges-after-nyc-riot-8646247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an apology</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/domainsdomain/status/1689433483058257921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decried fans’ actions</a> shortly after shit hit the fan. This is not to say that Cenat’s moral compass was rendered infallible by the lessons he learned on that fateful day; during the aforementioned Streamer University, for example, Cenat and friends palled around with and consistently praised YouTuber and rapper DDG, who has been <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/halle-bailey-ddg-restraining-order.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of physical and emotional abuse</a> in a restraining order filed by his ex, singer and actress Halle Bailey.</p><p>During the recent conversation with Adams, Cenat, cognizant of damage done by his previous event, asked if there was a way he could more safely run it back. Adams replied by pointing to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, a boxing event so wonky that one of its main fighters, Ryan Garcia, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2025/5/3/24422840/ryan-garcia-compares-times-square-fight-experience-to-weird-fever-dream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially blamed</a> its walled-off setup for his loss, but which nonetheless <a href="https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/45009726/an-look-day-boxing-took-new-york-s-square" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformed a portion of Times Square into a boxing arena</a> without descending into a riot.</p><p>"Let's look at what we just did two weeks ago,” said Adams. “We had a major, major boxing event right in the middle of Times Square. A couple hundred thousand people were there. They coordinated with the city. ... You can't still do [events] on the level you did before because now you've blown up. So now you have to do it on another level. You sit down with my team. I get the agencies involved. You map out what your plan is: ‘This is what I want to do. I want to do something to give back.’ Now you've got the city in alignment to make sure you can execute the plan."</p><p>Cenat found these terms agreeable, saying that he simply wants to “give back” to his home city after botching his first attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>He then returned to the more pressing matter at hand: “Is there a way that my friend like Fanum could probably get an apology for what happened or anything like that?”</p><p>Adams, initially confused, reiterated that he’ll look into it, and then, “if something was done wrong, [Fanum] will get an apology.”&nbsp;</p><p>Cenat then turned his attention to one last major concern:&nbsp;</p><p>"How do you get the key to the city or, like, a street sign?” he asked. “I just want to see Cenat Ave, or something like that."</p><p>“I’m looking to have Eric Ave,” Adams said, before explaining that City Council names streets, while Adams can indeed bestow the key to the city upon a worthy recipient, but only for their life’s work.</p><p>"That’ll be fire to get," said Cenat. "I just wanted to get the greenlight if I ever wanted to run back an event or run back something like [if] I can. Because, right now, I didn't know if I was able to run any event back to give back to New York because of what happened last time."</p><p>“Do it right,” Adams replied.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Cenat, “we'll do it right.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review"><h3>Lies Of P: Overture Is The Best Parts Of The Game Executed With Confidence</h3></a><p>Lies of P: Overture proves the success of the first game was no fluke, and establishes a bold house style.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo"><h3>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos</h3></a><p>No normal person could type 'Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway]]></content:encoded>

It's been an eventful news day for fans of adorably sinister horror series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>. Not only has the upcoming third instalment received a 10th October release date on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and  - as newly confirmed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, publisher Bandai Namco has announced an Enhanced Edition of the original game, <em>and</em> a brand-new VR instalment.
</p>
<p>
Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, which seems as good a place as any to start, promises a bit of a glow-up for developer Tarsier Studios' acclaimed 2017 original. This time around, players can experience raincoat-wearing protagonist Six's strange, dark escape from the mysterious, floating Maw at 4K resolution and 60fps. There's also talk of "RTX reflections, water effects, more particles, and volumetric lighting", plus a choice between Quality and Performance modes, depending on whether you prefer to prioritise visuals or framerate.
</p>
<p>
Bandai Namco has given Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition an official launch date of 10th October, but it's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now for anyone that pre-orders developer Supermassive Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. Switch 2 is also getting the Enhanced Edition, but not until October.

As for that VR version, it's title Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes and... that's pretty much all we know so far. Bandai Namco is yet to confirm a developer, even the platforms it's targeting, but we do get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CvZB0nFaoE">45-second announcement trailer</a> to tide us over. "Every step echoes closer," the publisher teases, "does this tune sound familiar, little ones?" Also promising is the newly teased Little Nightmares stop-motion project, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Bandai%20Namco">looks eerily beautiful in its brisk reveal trailer</a>, although there's no hint as to when or even <em>where</em> this might eventually show up. Is it related to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightmare-before-christmas-director-bringing-little-nightmares-to-tv">Little Nightmares TV show announced back in 2017</a>? Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
So to recap: Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is out now for those that pre-order Little Nightmares 3, otherwise both games launch on 10th October. Little Nightmares: Altered Echoes, meanwhile, exists, and there's not much else to say. As to what original Little Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios is up to now, having walked away from the series after part 2, that'll be Reanimal. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-studios-reanimal-is-more-kids-in-dark-places-but-now-with-co-op">another kids-in-dark-places horror adventure</a> (but with added co-op) that's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC later this year.
