<p>With Black Ops 7 now on the market, Call of Duty fans have expressed their opinions on the game’s campaign. However, the reactions are a bit underwhelming than what they expected.</p>







<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the campaign brings the series back to the Mason family, particularly David. The family, which was featured from Black Ops to Black Ops 2, has taken a back seat until now. With Black Ops 7, the campaign, fully multiplayer, takes players on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare-induced fever dream</a> where the team, including David, confronts Menendez and The Guild. Compared to other titles, especially last year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, it’s a bit of a crazy one. As you can expect, some have some strong opinions, good and bad, about how things were handled.</p>

<p>Since Black Ops 7’s release, the Call of Duty Reddit has been going through the motions, in a way. The reactions towards the game have ranged from hot garbage to series-best. However, there is a common thread between them: the game’s co-op campaign is not great. In a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/cod_the_warzonification_and_zombification_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AdBudget5468</a>, the user argues that the success of other modes like Zombies and Warzone have ‘ruined’ campaigns, with Black Ops 7 being a prime example. </p>



<p>In the comments, many fans expressed the same reaction. For some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novr5x3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Solid_Snek120</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/noxcdq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shadowdemon210</a>, it feels reminiscent of 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which had a very controversial campaign. Others, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novtolj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Top_Limit_</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/nowr2da/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SetScary9216</a>, brought up how polished Black Ops 6’s campaign was and how Black Ops 7’s just doesn’t match up. </p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t doing as hot as Activision may like. As it stands, Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k</a> while rival shooters ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 still get over 200k and even 300k on Steam. Despite this, the title will likely sell well, though it’s unknown just how well compared to other entries. Hopefully, as someone who enjoys the campaign, the next games can take from Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare and craft something all can enjoy without being a ploy to earn a battle royale mode.</p>







<p>What do you think of Black Ops 7’s campaign? Is it as bad as people said? Worse? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/massive-2200w-power-station-slashed-54-off-now-priced-at-budget-gas-generator-levels-without-the-stink-and-noise-2000644610</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-2200w-power-station-slashed-54-off-now-priced-at-budget-gas-generator-levels-without-the-stink-and-noise.1354897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gas generators solve power outages but fill your garage with fumes, wake the neighbors with engine noise and require constant fuel runs that get expensive fast. Portable power stations eliminate all those headaches while delivering clean electricity that works safely indoors during winter storms when you need heat, light, and charged devices the most.</p>
<p>The good news is that the <strong>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2</strong> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">dropped to an all-time low of $699 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,499 price</a>. This massive 2042Wh battery costs roughly what budget gas generators do, except it runs silently, produces zero emissions and charges from wall outlets or solar panels.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Crushes Gas Generator Alternatives</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2 is capable of providing <strong>up to 2200W continuous power via three AC outlets</strong>, and runs multiple appliances at the same time during outages or off-grid. That wattage capacity will run space heaters, electric blankets, mini fridges, laptops, and medical equipment all at once without overloading the system. The 2042Wh translates into real-world runtime that matters during extended winter power outages, keeping a typical space heater running for about four hours and charging laptops 30 times over.</p>
<p>Jackery engineered this unit using Cell-to-Body technology borrowed from electric vehicle manufacturing. CTB optimizes internal space by incorporating battery cells directly into the structural frame. This design approach minimizes wasted space and unnecessary materials, so this massive-capacity power station weighs just 39.5 pounds. That’s a <strong>41% weight reduction and 34% size decrease compared to typical 2kWh LiFePO4 power stations</strong> from competitors.</p>



<p>The secret to differentiating this Jackery from its slower competitors is multiple fast-charging pathways that get you back to full power quickly. Wall outlet AC charging <strong>pushes the battery from zero to 80% in just 66 minutes</strong> and gives you usable power fast when storms approach and you’re racing to prepare. The Emergency Super Charging mode accessible through Jackery’s smartphone app completes a full charge in 102 minutes; this accelerated charging generates more heat and should be reserved for genuine emergencies, though.</p>
<p>Silent Charging mode charges the battery to full capacity in five hours <strong>at whisper-quiet 30dB noise levels</strong> which is quieter than a library or a bedroom at night. This mode proves invaluable for overnight charging sessions where you may be trying to sleep or work without distraction from fan noise. The smart temperature control system constantly monitors internal component temperatures and automatically adjusts cooling fan speeds based on actual thermal load rather than operating fans at maximum speed regardless of conditions.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C PD 100W port charges laptops, tablets, and phones</strong> at the maximum possible speed, without separate power adapters that you’d otherwise need to plug into the AC outlets. Two more USB-A ports and a 12V car port handle smaller devices and accessories efficiently. The pure sine wave AC output protects sensitive electronics from the power quality issues that modified sine wave inverters create, and allows safe operation of everything from computers to medical equipment.</p>
<p>For $699, you’re paying budget gas generator prices for clean, quiet, indoor-safe power that charges multiple ways and lasts a decade.</p>

<p>In August, XSEED Games announced the <strong>Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack</strong> was coming "exclusively" to the Nintendo Switch in 2025. This pack was set to include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party">Corpse Party</a> (2001), <strong>Book of Shadows</strong>, <strong>Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Base</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party_blood_drive">Blood Drive</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Now, though, it's been cancelled in the west. Multiple games in this pack did not comply with the "current platform guidelines". This has resulted in the physical version of this pack (and digital offerings of previously unreleased titles) being axed. The publisher did not elaborate on this, but it's not the first time something like this has happened with an upcoming Switch release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hpumki&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the official update about this via the XSEED Games social media account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corpse Party fans:</p>
<p>We know how much you were anticipating the release of Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack. Though we previously released entries in the Corpse Party series on console platforms and digital storefronts in the West, we were informed that the contents of several games in the Tetralogy Pack did not comply with current platform guidelines. As a result, we are unable to release these games as intended and have subsequently canceled the physical release of Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack, as well as the digital offerings of previously unreleased Corpse Party games featured in the Tetralogy Pack.</p>
<p>We apologize for any confusion and disappointment this may have caused. We remain committed to working with our partners at MAGES to bring Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion to the West and will share more details on its release when we can. Thank you for your understanding and continued support of XSEED Games and the Corpse Party franchise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted, XSEED still aims to work with MAGES to release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/corpse_party_ii_darkness_distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a> locally in the future, so if there are any updates about this, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost-2000644605</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost.1354876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop shopping is overwhelming when you’re staring at options ranging from $200 Chromebooks that barely function to $3,000 premium machines loaded with specs you’ll never use. Most people just need something reliable for everyday tasks like web browsing, document work, video calls and media streaming. The Dell Vostro 15″ <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/">1TB model just crashed to an all-time low of $599 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,999 sticker</a>, and this 70% discount puts a brand-name business laptop at literally the same price point as generic budget machines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Value for Money Laptop</h2>
<p>The Vostro 3530 is powered by Intel’s 13th Generation Core i3-1305U, a five-core chip with one performance core and four efficiency cores. It divides the workload smartly between those efficiency and performance cores, depending on how demanding the task is. The performance core <strong>runs at a turbo frequency of as much as 4.5GHz for resource-intensive tasks</strong> such as video editing or a heavy spreadsheet while the efficiency cores do the background work without consuming much power to give you extended battery life.</p>



<p>Dell equipped this laptop with a <strong>massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM, placing it firmly in the realm of a professional workstation</strong> rather than basic consumer laptop specs. That amount of memory lets you run dozens of Chrome tabs, have multiple Microsoft Office documents open, stream background music, host video calls, and still have some headroom left over. Students can research papers with innumerable reference tabs open alongside writing in Word and chatting on Discord without their system choking.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is plenty to store years</strong> of documents, photos, and videos, and apps in a way that doesn’t require you to live in constant file management or cloud storage subscriptions. Modern SSDs like this one access data at speeds that make traditional hard drives seem prehistoric: they boot Windows 11 Pro within seconds of start-up and load programs almost instantly.</p>
<p>That<strong> 15.6-inch Full HD display refreshes at 120Hz</strong> instead of the more common 60Hz seen on most budget laptops, and it makes motion noticeably smoother as you scroll through documents, web pages, or video content. In practice, that doubled refresh rate reduces eye fatigue during long work sessions because the subtle flicker and stuttering common with lower refresh displays are gone. The anti-glare coating and 250-nit brightness let you work near windows without reflections destroying visibility, while the narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s physical footprint.</p>
<p>With it, <strong>you get Windows 11 Professional pre-installed</strong> rather than the Home edition found on consumer laptops, offering extra security features, remote desktop capability, and business-focused tools that matter for professional environments. The Pro edition supports BitLocker encryption for protecting sensitive data, domain joining for corporate networks, and advanced group policy controls needed by IT departments.</p>
<p>Connectivity options fill both modern and legacy needs with a practical mix of ports. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C handles fast data transfers and can connect to modern docks and displays, while traditional USB-A ports ensure the existing peripherals work without adapters. The RJ-45 Ethernet port provides you with dependable wired network connections that surpass WiFi in stability and speed in a home office or dorm room. External monitors or projectors are connected via HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and expanded workspaces.</p>
<p>You’re getting here 32GB RAM, 1TB storage, a 120Hz display, and Windows 11 Pro for $599, which is what most people pay for basic 8GB Chromebooks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000644601</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon.1354870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First major Black Friday deals just landed on Amazon and Xbox controllers finally joined the discount party with their deepest price cut ever. Gaming controllers take a beating from intense button mashing, thumbstick abuse and the occasional rage-induced floor meeting so having a backup or upgrade becomes essential rather than optional.</p>
<p>The Xbox wireless gaming controller in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Carbon Black just hit an all-time low of $49 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $64 price</a>, and over 20,000 people grabbed one this month as stock moves incredibly fast. This 2025 model works across more devices than any previous Xbox controller which makes it useful beyond just console gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Gaming</h2>
<p>Microsoft designed this controller with universal compatibility extending well beyond the Xbox consoles, wirelessly <strong>connecting to Windows PCs, Android phones and tablets, iOS devices, FireTV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. This means that you buy one quality controller and use it everywhere, rather than having different gamepads for every different platform you own.</p>
<p>That <strong>Bluetooth connection rapidly pairs with any device</strong> it’s hooked up to, which sidesteps the clutter of dongles and adapters found with older controllers. You can easily toggle between playing Halo on your Series X, streaming games on your phone during your lunch break and changing media on your Fire TV Stick without juggling multiple remotes or controllers.</p>



<p>The ergonomic design refines the proven Xbox controller shape that’s felt natural in gamers’ hands for over two decades with subtle improvements to grip texture and button placement. The textured surfaces on the triggers, bumpers and back casing provide a secure grip even during sweaty gaming sessions or when your hands get slick from snacks. Microsoft positioned the buttons and thumbsticks at distances that reduce hand fatigue during extended play, so you can game for hours without developing cramping or soreness in your thumbs and fingers.</p>



<p>The hybrid D-pad delivers accurate input for fighting games, platformers and any title that requires precise directional commands. This design marries the best aspects of traditional cross-shaped D-pads with the faceted style that most hardcore fighting game players prefer, providing you with tactile feedback for each direction press without mushy or ambiguous inputs. You’ll nail complex move combinations and rapid direction changes more consistently compared to cheaper controllers with spongy or imprecise directional pads.</p>
<p>Textured grips on the triggers and bumpers improve control in those split-second moments of intense gaming that determine victory or defeat. The triggers feature smooth analog travel that works perfectly for racing games where gradual acceleration and braking come into play, while also providing crisp digital clicks for shooters that need instant fire response.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life runs on two AA batteries that are expected to give about 40 hours of gameplay</strong> before needing replacement, giving you weeks of casual gaming or several marathon weekend sessions between battery swaps. The AA battery design lets you choose between disposable batteries for convenience or rechargeable batteries for cost savings and environmental benefits in the long term. You can also connect the controller via USB-C cable for wired play that eliminates any potential wireless latency while simultaneously charging rechargeable batteries if you’re using them.</p>
<p><strong>The 3.5mm headset jack</strong> connects any wired gaming headset directly, thereby routing game audio and chat through your headphones without the need for separate dongles or adapters. This direct connection reduces the audio latency compared to wireless headsets and gives you instant sound feedback, which helps in competitive gaming when hearing the enemy’s footsteps or gunshots a fraction of a second earlier provides strategic advantages.</p>
<p>At $49, you get Microsoft’s official controller quality for less money than most third-party alternatives that lack build quality or platform support.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure I've ever been so quickly transported back in time than I have in I Write Games Not Tragedies. It's not that I completely relate to what takes place in the game, but its sense of place, of atmosphere and feeling, is one I understand in my soul. The emo amongst you have probably already caught on to the vibe with its title, and for those of you that haven't, the game's aesthetics, writing, and soundscape certainly will.
</p>
<p>
Set in some nowhere British town in the distant past of 2009, you play as Ash, a babby goth who thinks everything in his life is unbearably terrible, and that everyone around him is insufferable and deserving of his (internally narrated) belittlement. The popular kids are much too popular, his parents won't let him hang out on the roof in the rain, and of course there's school, yuck! No one understands him, but when he puts on his red Skullcandy headphones (what a throwback), he can escape into the world of music… which is where this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> game morphs into a rhythm game, uh, game.
</p>
<p>
Now, this isn't a revolution of rhythm game mechanics. There are three buttons to tap, and you must time your taps to certain words in the lyrics of whatever song is playing. You can jam out at certain moments, but in the demo I couldn't get that to work, a point I'm sure could be solved with some updated tutorialisation.
</p>
<p>
I'm not particularly bothered by the fairly lackluster rhythm mechanics because of the ways it commits to itself in so many other ways. The soundtrack, for one, is composed of tracks from indie punk artists from the UK, Japan, and Hong Kong, which itself is a thematically appropriate commitment to make. The backgrounds look like they were made on Paint circa 2009 (complementary), but there are also cringey anime drawings of Ash's classmates, as well as some of his himself where he looks much too cool. This pencilly, sketchy, crayony vibe translates to certain bits of character art too, albeit a bit more refined, and very much in the vein of something like Scott Pilgrim.
</p><p>
That feeling of cringe permeates a lot of the demo, and presumably the rest of the game. Ash kind of sucks, specifically in the way that teenagers sucked in the late 2000s. He drinks WKD at some canal with a boy he clearly has a crush on, a drink so notoriously unable to get you drunk unless you are literally 14, and one anyone would be mocked for drinking as an adult. I was not Ash, but I've known Ash, and I have cringed at Ash.
</p>
<p>
In the years since knowing my own Ash, or Ashes I supposed, I've since acquired some rose tinted goggles thick enough that at least allow me to look back on such a time and chuckle a little bit, even if it's also a bit embarrassing to think about. That same feeling comes through in I Write Games Not Tragedies, and that might not be for everyone. If you've ever listened to My Chemical Romance and you grew up in some nowhere British town, however, you probably owe it to yourself to give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I Write Games Not Tragedies is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3396670/I_Write_Games_Not_Tragedies/">available on Steam now</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-the-meta-quest-3s-your-cheapest-path-to-premium-vr-is-nearly-free-2000644596</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-the-meta-quest-3s-your-cheapest-path-to-premium-vr-is-nearly-free.1354852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Virtual reality stopped being a futuristic fantasy the moment Meta cracked the code on affordable and high-quality headsets that actually work without a gaming PC tethered to your head. The <strong>Quest 3S brings premium VR experiences at a fraction of what you’d expect to pay</strong>, and Amazon just dropped both storage configurations to record-low prices for early Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">128GB model (including a Gorilla Tag bundle) now costs $249 instead of $299</a>; and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the 256GB version (including Batman: Arkham Shadow) sits at $329 down from $399</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Quest 3S Destroys the Value Competition</h2>
<p>Meta equipped the Quest 3S with the same core processor inside the flagship Quest 3 <strong>and offers you identical graphical processing capability for significantly less</strong>. That Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip boasts double the GPU performance of the Quest 2 for rendering virtual environments with sharper textures, smoother frame rates and more complex objects.</p>
<p>The Quest 3S runs <strong>entirely wireless and frees you from the cable management nightmares that plague PC VR setups</strong>. You simply charge the headset, put it on, and jump into experiences without configuring external sensors or worrying about tripping over cords mid-game. This standalone design means you can play in your living room or even outside if you want with the h<strong>eadset tracking your movements</strong> through built-in cameras and sensors. Battery life typically gives you<strong> two to three hours of active play</strong> before needing a recharge which feels about right for VR sessions before eye strain sets in anyway.</p>



<p>Both bundles include<strong> immediate access to more than 40 games</strong>&nbsp;and avoids the sticker shock of buying a headset only to find out you’ll have to spend another hundred bucks on software. The 128GB version includes an exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle, while the 256GB model throws in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>, along with a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+, which unlocks even more premium titles.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that’s become a cultural phenomenon in VR, it’s Gorilla Tag, which lets you swing through environments using only arm movements in a shockingly physical workout disguised as a game. Batman: Arkham Shadow is a full-fledged superhero adventure built specifically for VR with hand-to-hand combat and detective work that feels genuinely immersive.</p>
<p>Storage considerations matter more than you might think with VR headsets, too. Games with detailed environments and high-resolution textures can easily consume 10GB to 20GB each, and the Quest 3S does not support expandable storage. The 128GB model gives you enough room for roughly eight to ten major games plus several smaller experiences, which works fine if you’re comfortable deleting and redownloading titles as you rotate through your library. The 256GB version doubles that capacity and lets you maintain a larger installed library without constant storage management.</p>



<p>The visual experience inside the Quest 3S uses <strong>Fresnel lenses with a resolution of 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye</strong>, and matches the Quest 2’s clarity while benefiting from that doubled processing power. Colors pop with better saturation, black levels deepen in dark scenes, and the overall image feels crisper during gameplay. The Quest 3 does offer slightly better optics with pancake lenses that reduce the headset’s overall bulk, but the visual improvement doesn’t justify the $250 price premium for most users.</p>
<p><strong>Meta’s mixed reality capabilities</strong> transform your real room into a game zone by mapping your furniture and walls, then seamlessly integrating virtual elements. You could place a virtual chess board on your real coffee table, have a movie screen floating above your couch, or defend your living room from virtual invaders crawling across your real furniture.</p>
<p><strong>The Quest 3S weighs about 515 grams</strong> and distributes that mass across your face with adjustable straps that take into account head size and shapes. Comfort will, of course, vary from person to person, but most people can handle hour-plus sessions before taking a break. The included elastic strap works well enough, though more serious VR enthusiasts often upgrade to Meta’s Elite Strap for better weight distribution during longer play.</p>
<p>At these early Black Friday prices, the Quest 3S completely rewrites the entry cost for quality VR. When you’re paying almost double for marginal improvements, the regular Quest 3 simply can’t compete on value. And for PC-based headsets, an expensive computer is needed in addition to the investment into the headset itself. Meta nailed the sweet spot between performance and affordability with this model.</p>

            <p>
I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> was much more of a turning point for Sony than most people really discuss. The argument for PlayStation used to be its exclusives, those tentpole games like Uncharted, Ratchet and Clank, LittleBigPlanet, the list does go on but you get the point. On the PS5, completely original first-party games feel few and far between, as Sony has joined in on the whole intellectual property above all else train that every other company has hopped aboard. So hearing Guerilla Games' studio director Jan-Bart van Beek say the Horizon series was always thought about as a multiplayer game feels like the last piece of the puzzle has been inserted.
</p>
<p>
Here's what van Beek said specifically, in referencing the just announced Horizon MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-an-mmorpg-twist-on-sonys-series-about-plinking-robo-animals-with-arrows-is-coming-to-pc">Steel Frontiers</a>: "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we’re excited to show you what is coming."

Apologies for taking a curmudgeonly attitude towards this, but of course that's how it was always thought about! Well, assuming this is true across the board. I imagine there are plenty who worked on the original that won't feel that way. The top brass feeling that way does make sense, however. Ultimately the goal isn't striving to make something fresh, but something that can keep you playing, and presumably paying, for longer.
</p>

Live service is constantly on Sony's mind, and it is pretty clear that multiplayer is on Guerilla's. Clearing up some confusion, industry secrets knower <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">Jason Schreier took to Bluesky</a> to say that the NCSoft developer Horizon Steel Frontiers MMO isn't that rumoured - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-12-minutes-of-early-horizon-multiplayer-game-footage-leaks-online">and leaked</a> - Horizon Multiplayer game. That one is still in the works at Guerilla, and is apparently their next big project.
</p><p>
But it's this reality where Horizon was supposedly always meant to be multiplayer that my feelings on the original being a turning point come from. A mobile-only Ratchet and Clank multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlblXRS14Mg">just announced this week</a>, for heaven's sake. As much of a farce as the Sony first-party game was, at least every now and then it would offer up something new. Ah well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pilot-a-shrimp-and-do-battle-with-giant-eldritch-sea-monsters-in-the-armored-core-adjacent-shrimp-game?view=comments">at least we have Shrimp Game</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is here, and fans worldwide are enjoying it – or those who can <strong>access the game are</strong>, anyway. It’s the dawn of a new era for the stellar extraction shooter, which has grown over the last decade to become a staple of the industry and a leader of the genre.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update brings stacks of changes, and one that players are struggling to contend with concerns the game’s <strong>Flea Market </strong>mechanic. It has been discovered that ‘categories’ of the Flea Market are locked until you progress to a fairly high level.</p>







<h2 id="h-flea-market-locked-down-again">Flea Market Locked Down Again</h2>



<p>The latest changes to Escape from Tarkov have been a mixed bag. On one hand, the new map, faction, weapons, and 1,000 bug fixes are welcome, but the shattered servers that are having issues hosting the hundreds of thousands of players trying to get into the game, we can do without.</p>



<p>One change that’s proving to be divisive is the alteration made to the game’s Flea Market, the peer-to-peer trading solution that allows users to buy and sell gear they find, craft, or steal.</p>



<p>With 1.0, players are now being forced to hit minimum level requirements to open up sections of the Flea Market, with certain categories remaining under lock for quite some time.&nbsp;The base Flea Market unlocks at Level 15 as always, but there are higher restrictions now in terms of levels.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’ve seen so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bolt-action rifles – Level 20</li>



<li>Assault rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Marksman rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Backpacks – Level 25</li>



<li>Foregrips – Level 20</li>



<li>Light and laser devices – Level 25</li>



<li>Muzzle devices – Level 20</li>
</ul>



<p>It gets a bit more extreme in some places:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barter items – Level 30</li>



<li>Gear components – Level 30</li>



<li>Injectors – Level 30</li>



<li>Keycards – Level 30</li>
</ul>



<p>And some high-tier ammo will remain locked for a very long time:</p>



<ul>
<li>PS12B – Level 40</li>



<li>M80 – Level 35</li>



<li>Blackout CJB – Level 40</li>
</ul>

<p>This is believed to be an effort to counter cheaters trying to participate in RMT (real-money trading), but it has rubbed some fans the wrong way.</p>

            <p>
Video games don't have mysteries any more. There are too many people and too much internet to allow for such a thing, anything without an answer can, must, and will be solved by someone, often in a timeframe faster than developers expect. So I appreciate when developers refuse to divulge details, or indulge individuals in their desire to know exactly how much they have on their checklist, one such developer being Tonda Ros of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> developer Dogubomb.
</p>
<p>
In response to a question from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/i-will-probably-never-fully-acknowledge-whether-or-not-everything-has-been-solved-says-blue-prince-creator-there-are-certainly-mysteries-still-in-the-game/">PC Gamer</a> regarding whether there are any mysteries left to be found in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game, Ros said that there certainly are, and that "there will probably always be some mysteries in the game. And in order to preserve that mystery, I will probably never fully acknowledge whether or not everything has been solved." Music to my ears!
</p>
<p>
Ros goes further, saying, "I know that for some games, they'll have, like, a canary in the coal mine, right? I think it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> that has a website that's like, 'Has everything been found yet?' That kind of serves as a canary." As it turns out, such a website does exist, it's <a href="http://haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com/">haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com</a>, and I'll let you click to find out what the answer is.
</p>
<p>
For Ros, that question of whether everything has been found in Blue Prince is one he thinks people will always ask. "The only thing I will say is that there are still mysteries," he said. "Not to say that they're necessarily things that can be solved in definitive ways, but they are things that you can piece together answers to, oftentimes intuitively."
</p><p>
I truly hope this is something we see more of from developers going forwards. There is such a massive inclination towards complete and utter player satisfaction, but to me there is nothing more satisfying than to be left wanting more, a reason to keep coming back, even if the gaps between return trips end up being days, weeks, months or years at a time. Lay unto me your mysterious developers! I may not solve them, but I will think about them.
</p>
<p>
And while you're here, I'd like to remind you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-team-behind-blue-prince-puts-out-a-call-to-get-one-of-the-puzzle-games-devs-a-life-saving-kidney">one of the lead playtesters on Blue Prince is in desperate need of a kidney</a>, something you genuinely might be able to help with.

            <p>Escape from Tarkov is sitting on a Mostly Negative rating today after yesterday's eagerly-awaited Steam debuted to stability and performance issues that prevent players even logging in, let alone play.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that players are experiencing "problems connecting to the servers and authorising in the game launcher", developer Battlestate said its "technical team is actively working to stabilise the game servers and authorisation services" and apologised for any inconvenience caused.</p>

<p>It hasn't stopped thousands of unhappy people leaving negative reviews, though, with just 34% of the 7200+ reviews left since yesterday's launch reporting a positive experience.

The sound doesn't work, everyone moves absolutely silently. Bosses and Scavs walk through doors like they don't exist. Players are plunged into despair the moment another server error occurs. Every raid is a dissertation in disappointment, a Shakespearean tragedy written by drunken raccoons on fire. You don't play Escape from Tarkov you endure it, you endure until madness becomes your only friend."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After a lot of negative feedback and tumbling player counts, Bungie have acknowledged that they made some poor decisions with Destiny 2. Here is their statement from this week’s TWAB.</p>
<p><em>“With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards. &nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for Destiny.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing through throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of Destiny’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>From 9.0.0 on through 9.1.5, our focus across the entire team has been response to player feedback, starting with the fastest changes and working through the more challenging ones. Our focus was on faster, better Rewards, more player agency in activity choice, and removing barriers to playing with friends.</em></p>

<p><em>Since Destiny launched over ten years ago, it has always been a living, reactive world. Through our successes and failures, we are grateful for the opportunities to explore different paths, learn from them, and with that clarity, build an inspiring new vision with, and for, our players. As we work on our plans and communications to address your feedback, thank you for being on this journey with us as we reshape our strategy for the long-term future of the Destiny franchise. “</em></p>
<p>The Portal and the associated power grind had come under heavy criticism as it required players to play the same few activities over and over again just to raise their power levels up before they could start getting decent weapon drops. This meant playing other activities, such as Dares of Eternity was completely pointless, and if you did, the matchmaking was unlikely to find any other players.</p>
<p>Updates 9.5.0 (December 2) and 9.5.0.1 (December 9) will begin to make changes to how the game works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wider access to Power progression, especially in Expansion content.
<ul>
<li>Players will be able to reach the Power cap directly through Renegades activities if they wish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seasonal Power and Featured Gear carrying across Seasons.
<ul>
<li>All Exotic weapons and armor are now featured.</li>
<li>Additionally, we’re moving Power catch-up from a chest needing manual pickup to organic drops: sign in, play Renegades, catapult to 300 Power, and play with your friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vault capacity and upgrades to ease collection pressure.
<ul>
<li>We have increased Vault capacity by an additional 300 slots to 1000, and we’re working on more.</li>
<li>In addition, the Vault now has a revamped filtering system to help find what you’re looking for faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Renegades looks fun so I will be re-joining the Guardians when it launches, will you?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally live on Steam with its long-anticipated 1.0 release. To celebrate the occasion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we brought you an exclusive interview with Nikita Buyanov</a>, Game Director of Battlestate Games, discussing the long journey toward the full launch, the content available in this new version, some of what will be coming in the future, and a few thoughts on the genre as a whole.</p>



<p>Additionally, we also inquired about controller support for the PC version and about a potential launch on console platforms. Here's what Buyanov told us:</p>



<p><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></p>



<p>It does sound like this is still further away, since the studio hasn't even begun working on it yet. It may be quite a while, considering how long it took Battlestate Games to release Escape from Tarkov. Still, it's good news for all those who'd love to play it on consoles, or at least to play it on PC, but with the comfort of a gamepad.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is currently available at a 15% discount on Steam through Saturday, November 29. During the same timeframe, customers can alternatively purchase the game <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> at a 10% discount for all editions and a 30% discount for The Unheard Edition.</p>



<p>Exclusive in-game rewards will be given to beta test participants and players who placed a pre-order. These rewards are permanent and will not be deleted during profile resets. The items are credited automatically.</p>



<p>The game's launch also coincides with a new Twitch Drops campaign. From now through December 6 at 11:30 GMT/06:30 EST, viewers of streams in the Escape from Tarkov category will receive unboxable containers containing items of varying rarity levels, along with other rewards, at specific intervals. Rewards obtained through this campaign will remain with players even after a profile wipe.</p>

            <p>
I do have to admit that bringing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> feels like digging up a dead dog that perished in a horrendous, preventable accident, but it feels important given how quickly it died and what the means for how we engage with it. You see, it seems that this week the largely panned hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was revived through community-run custom servers. Except it seems like this may be over before it truly begins.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/">The Game Post</a>, developers that go by the names Red, open_wizard, and gwog opened up a Discord server where you could try out Concord through said custom servers. This is apparently possible through the trio recreating the game's backend API and thusly reverse engineering it. Some videos were even posted to YouTube showing off these custom servers in action, which is where things have started to go legally iffy.
</p>
<p>
Both videos, as again reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, were taken down through a copyright claim filed by MarkScan Enforcement, most likely on Sony's behalf. I say most likely, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightmare-kart-is-getting-a-free-dlc-but-sonys-plague-ridden-rats-have-come-for-bloodborne-psx">as MarkScan did the exact same thing to Bloodborne PSX</a> on behalf of Sony earlier this year. It's not surprising the same thing has been done to Concord here, especially as the custom servers won't have much legal ground to stand on.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that these takedowns are for the videos themselves. So far nothing seems to have been done about the custom servers themselves, but in a statement in the Discord for the project, developer Red said "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being." At the time of writing, any links to the Discord server no longer work.
</p><p>
This all feels pertinent to the ongoing situation with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">Stop Killing Games</a>, a campaign that seeks to "challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers." Personally, I don't love the consumerist angle to the campaign, but there is something to be said of the need to protect online-only games from certain doom. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Concord are toys, you smash action figures together in them for ridiculous results, yet you can only do it in the way you've been told to. That stinks! I often think of the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> in particular, and the playful space Valve created with it that allowed for many a machinima. That feels like more important a reason to preserve online games, to allow for a freer sense of play once the corporate overlords have stopped making money from their toy business. Let's see how things play out for new, slightly less legal Concord.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zelda-movie-leaks-hint-at-first-major-actor-reveal.1354732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked set footage</a> of The Legend of Zelda movie may show who is playing an iconic character in the franchise. Furthermore, it’s done by one of TV’s biggest stars from Severance.</p>







<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/">The Super Mario Bros</a>. Movie in 2023 and the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy film, Nintendo is on quite a roll with films. Its blockbuster sales at the Box Office proved that bringing its IPs to theaters can work if done well. The company’s next project is a highly ambitious live-action adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Directed by The Maze Runner’s Wes Ball, the film is set to release on May 7th, 2027. The film has cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link and Zelda</a>, but the rest of the cast has yet to be revealed. With filming underway, the process has been done and, with a new video leak, we may know who’s playing one of Zelda’s biggest supporters.</p>



<h2 id="h-severance-star-may-be-playing-impa-in-the-legend-of-zelda-leak-hints-nbsp">Severance Star May Be Playing Impa in The Legend of Zelda, Leak Hints&nbsp;</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Nintendo </figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?igsh=MW40OGJvOXRqamx0Zw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the leaked video on Instagram</a>, a figure can be seen lecturing Zelda and granting her a sword. As we only know Link and Zelda’s actors, seeing a new person on set does indicate more has been added. With them lecturing Zelda, one could assume the character is Impa, Zelda’s Sheikan guardian. Given that some versions of the character can range in age, it seems the film could be taking notes from the younger version shown in Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1oxjpdt/movie_there_is_leaked_footage_of_the_zelda_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fans on Reddit were quick</a> to point out that the actress in the Legend of Zelda movie video leak looked strikingly familiar to Severance’s Dichen Lachman, who played counselor Ms. Casey in the popular Apple TV+ series. The actress has grown into a household name with Severance, as well as big roles in Neighbors, Jurassic World Dominion, and in the upcoming second season of Netflix’ The Last Airbender.&nbsp;Interestingly enough, the actress did star in Wes Ball’s last film, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.&nbsp;Regardless, no official confirmation has been made on the casting, so take it and the leak with a grain of salt. However, if the fans’ reactions are proof enough, the actress would be perfect as Impa.</p>







<p>What do you think of The Legend of Zelda movie leak? Think Dichen Lachman is Impa? Another character? What do you make of the leaks? Let us know in the comments and on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <p>Our first look at the cast of the live-action Legend of Zelda movie has leaked online.</p>
<p>Captured in New Zealand, the video appears to show the cast in action, and while we can't hear anything meaningful, we do get a glimpse at Bo Bragason as the titular Zelda.</p>
<p>A separate snippet, presumably taken at or near the same time, also showsm Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, too, complete in his signature green outfit. You can check it out below:</p>

<p>Last week things moved forward with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">the live-action Legend of Zelda film, which has now commenced production</a>. It follows in the footsteps of esteemed movies and shows like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series by filming in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a>, respectively, in the upcoming adaptation, which is currently set for release in 2027.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Nintendo and Lego recently teased a new set based on The Legend of Zelda, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-legos-next-the-legend-of-zelda-set-will-be-based-on-ocarina-of-time">which looks to be based on Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>

            <p>
The leads behind the, potentially surprisingly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-superhero-comedy-dispatch-a-million-selling-success-story-it-could-be-that-weekly-release-schedule">hit superhero game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, AdHoc Studio, have been all over the place. Telltale Games, Ubisoft, Night School Studio, some pretty notable names, but today we're honing in on their time at Ubisoft in particular. That's because a recent report that dives into the long story that led AdHoc to making Dispatch revealed that before doing so, they were working on a completely new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> game at Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
Nick Herman, one of the co-founders of AdHoc, shared said detail with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, saying that he was "so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while. And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love." Obviously this game never materialised, and according to Herman it was partially due to the whims of executives at the time.
</p>
<p>
This was back in 2017, a time when Ubisoft was gaining interest in live service games, and so this new Splinter Cell game just didn't fit into that vision. "We tried," Herman said. "Let’s make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made." Nothing they did try worked, apparently, but eventually it somehow morphed into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">xDefiant</a>, though this was post the AdHoc team forming.
</p>
<p>
If you need a reminder, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">xDefiant was shut down only a year after it was released</a>, resulting in mass layoffs. It also started life as a Tom Clancy game, so you can see the Splinter Cell connection at least.
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that xDefiant producer Mark Rubin commented on his personal Dwitter account regarding this report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122">claiming it wasn't true</a>, and that the shooter had never started life as a Splinter Cell game. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5oad3lxlc25">as pointed by the author of said Bloomberg report Jason Schreier</a>, Rubin joined Ubisoft in 2019, two years after the Dispatch team was working on Splinter Cell. So, yes, the folks that made Dispatch were working on a Splinter Cell game once upon a time, as long as nobody is lying to us, and if they are, please don't shoot me (the fabled messenger).

            <title><![CDATA[Concord Has Effectively Been Shut Down By Sony For A Second Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-has-effectively-been-shut-down-by-sony-for-a-second-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-has-effectively-been-shut-down-by-sony-for-a-second-time.1354705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>We don’t think much needs to be said about Concord at this point. The live-service shooter apparently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost over $400 million to develop</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team behind it was quickly shut down by Sony</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation took Concord offline within days of launch</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>







<h2 id="h-sony-issues-dmcas-to-concord-pc-revival">Sony Issues DMCAs To Concord PC Revival</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Burn it down. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported on November 14 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-pc-fan-made-multiplayer-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord got a playable fan-made revival on PC</a>. Users cleverly managed to get custom Concord servers up and running—requiring special access to let you play.</p>



<p>What seemed like innocent fun has quickly turned into the gaze of Sony being cast upon them.</p>



<p>A dev post in the Concord Delta Discord updated everyone on a serious development:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>It transpires that gameplay videos of the Concord project had made their way to YouTube. DMCA action was immediately imposed by MarkScan—a name that works a lot on Sony’s behalf. If you add the facts up, it’s fairly obvious to see what’s happened.</p>



<p>As a result, the Concord PC project and servers are on hold, and unless something drastic changes, it probably means Sony is once again responsible for the death of Concord.</p>



<p>Is it better that we all move on from Concord at this point? Or is it a shame to see a handful of people who cared about the short-lived shooter have their hard work up in flmaes? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to share your thoughts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possessor-s-is-a-fast-paced-action-game-that-gets-off-to-a-slow-start.1354693/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I remember being blown away by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd32M4-muA">the 2024 reveal trailer</a> for <em>Possessor(s)</em>, the new game from <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> developer Heart Machine. The trailer features a striking art design, where an animated 2D character explores and fights in side-scrolling environments with gorgeous 3D backgrounds, and it’s all set to moody, powerful music. The final game, which came out this month, wasn’t quite as awe-inspiring as that initial trailer made it seem, and I almost quit it — but I’m really glad I saw it to the end.</p><p>In <em>Possessor(s)</em>, you play as Luca, a girl who is possessed by Rehm, a demon from another realm. After a catastrophe strikes, Rehm saves Luca’s life by creating legs for her — but from then on, Luca serves as a host for Rhem, meaning they can talk to each other all the time and occasionally see into each other’s memories. The two have a contentious relationship. They bicker <em>constantly</em>, which sometimes made them difficult for me to care about. But over the course of the game, their relationship evolves as they come to understand more about each other and the worlds they came from.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Luca (left) and Rhem (right).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Heart Machine describes <em>Possessor(s)</em> as a “fast-paced action side scroller,” but this is a <em>Metroid</em>- or <em>Castlevania</em>-style game through and through. You’ll explore an interconnected world with distinct zones, spend a lot of time looking at the map to try and find the next path to explore, and collect helpful traversal upgrades like a wall run to help you access new areas. Very early on, you’ll pick up a whip, and it serves double duty as an exploration tool to cross large gaps and a key weapon in battle.</p><p>Fights are <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/smash-bros-meets-metroidvania-in-possessor-s-heart-machines-new-side-scrolling-opus/">inspired by</a> platform fighters like <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, meaning they’re fast-paced and crunchy, and you’ll take on enemies with weapons inspired by regular things you might have around your house. My usual strategy consisted of whaling on enemies up close with a large baseball bat, shocking them with an electric blast from a cellphone to create space, and flinging demonic silverware across rooms to hit faraway targets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">Parrying</a> is a key part of fights, too.</p><p>Early on, though, <em>Possessor(s)</em> was <em>very</em> tough. Regular enemies hit hard, and if you lose focus for just a second or get caught in an unlucky combo, you can die without any time to react. Dying sends you back to the <em>Possessor(s)</em> equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_(Dark_Souls)"><em>Dark Souls</em> bonfires</a>, but the return trips to where you died can be long, arduous, and filled with danger. (The game also uses a <em>Souls</em>-like flask system, swapping flasks for painkillers to let you recover health.)</p><p>Usually, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020">I like that kind of challenge</a>, but something about <em>Possessor(s)</em>’s level and enemy design often made the early game feel more frustrating than fun for me. I also got <em>very</em> lost after the first few hours, exploring way more of the map than I needed to because I couldn’t figure out how to get past some mysterious walls with glowy cracks on them. I contemplated putting down the game for good.</p><p>However, after finally learning how to open those walls (use the whip!), getting a few health and painkiller upgrades, and seeing more nuance to Luca and Rhem’s relationship, I started to enjoy the game much more. I finally settled into the satisfying <em>Metroid</em> loop of exploring a new area, finding a new upgrade, using that to get to the next boss, getting the next MacGuffin, and then doing it all over again in the next zone.</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> didn’t possess me in the way that I expected it might. Based on my initial impressions, the game seemed cooked in a lab to appeal to my exact tastes. I just needed to have some patience. The game culminated in a final level that really put my skills to the test and a striking battlefield for the final boss. As I watched the credits roll, I realized it had all finally evoked some of those feelings I had watching the game’s first trailer.</p><p><sup>Possessor(s)</sup><em><sup> is out now on PC and PS5.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/821117/possessors-review-pc-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-season-1%E2%80%94release-period-all-new-maps-zombies-content-more.1354684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 begins another 12-month content crusade. New maps, guns, game modes, Operators, events, and all the usual hullabaloo that comes with a new CoD season. We have the latest Black Ops 7 Season 1 release information, as well as the known S1 content.</p>



<p>You could argue that this hasn’t been the most hyped CoD in history—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player numbers</a> would agree. Nevertheless, thousands of players have dived into Black Ops 7, meaning that Season 1 will have its fair share of recruits. If you want to know when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLOPS 7 Season 1</a> starts, read on for the crucial pointers.</p>







<p>Also, if you haven’t picked up the game yet, or you intend to, we have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">cheapest way to buy Black Ops 7</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-release-date">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run for it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We expect Black Ops 7 Season 1 to kick off on December 4, because it coincides with the end of Black Ops 6 Season 6—Signaling the transition from Black Ops 6’s seasonal content ending and Black Ops 7’s beginning.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been in the live-service loop before, you know the drill. Once a previous season ends, the next one begins. BLOPS 7 has a brief period between launch and Season 1 called the ‘preseason’.</p>







<p>We know for sure that the legendary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown map</a> is a big addition in the preseason period. Once we cross this barrier, it’s time to move on to Season 1. Treyarch is likely to confirm the Season 1 start date in the coming days, but don’t be surprised to see December 4 as the official start date!</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-start-time">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>Again, based on existing data, Black Ops 7 Season 1 onlookers can expect the new season to begin around 9 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>This is a simple case of deduction using the end of the Black Ops 6 Season 6 Battle Pass. It’s what happens with all Call of Duty seasons, and we expect Season 1 to be no different.</p>



<p>If this isn’t the case, we’ll update this hub and let you know of any confirmed times, delays, or changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-amp-zombies-content">All Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to take in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 1 introduces a whopping 7 multiplayer maps, 7 weapons, remastered content, new multiplayer modes, new LTMs, Holiday season content, and 3 new Zombies maps.</strong></p>



<p>Where do we begin? Let’s start with the Zombies content to mix it up.</p>

<p>The Season 1 roadmap has confirmed that <strong>Astra Malorum</strong> is a new round-based Zombies map—to add to Ashes of the Damned—and there will also be two additional Survival maps.</p>



<p>We’ve covered all of this and more in our complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Zombies hub</a>.</p>



<p>Zombies fans will be satiated with flesh and fun for the foreseeable future, at least. Knowing Treyarch, there is probably the odd surprise here and there you’ll need to uncover!</p>

<p>The main course for most is the multiplayer content. A lot of maps are currently locked in for Season 1, adding to the 18 multiplayer maps that launched with the base game.</p>



<p>Here’s every confirmed map for Season 1 already:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fate</li>



<li>Meltdown</li>



<li>Nuketown (Technically a preseason map)</li>



<li>Odysseus</li>



<li>Standoff (Remaster)</li>



<li>Utopia</li>



<li>Yakei</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, 7 “new &amp; fan-favorite weapons” are coming—including the <strong>Maddox</strong> from Black Ops 4—and we don’t quite know what the new game modes and extras entail.</p>



<p>Treyarch will reveal all when the time is right. Stay tuned for more updates on Season 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hitman_absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> is widely regarded as the ‘black sheep’ of the series thanks to its focus on cinematic storytelling over player freedom. This is very much still the case with this fresh release on Switch from Feral Interactive, but now that original developer IO Interactive has righted the ship with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">World of Assassination</a> trilogy, it’s much easier to look back on Absolution and better appreciate it for what it is – kind of like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean it’s perfect? No, far from it. But it’s a fascinating detour for Agent 47 that still provides ample fun while laying foundations for later titles, including the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>.</p>
<p>Like previous entries, Absolution requires you to locate your targets and dispatch them with as little fuss as possible (while constantly evading the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/po-po">po-po</a>). Nailing a high stealth rating is what it’s all about, but if you prefer to go in guns blazing, that’s an option. Otherwise, sneaky little ‘accidents’ are often the best course of action, and you can activate Instinct Mode to highlight enemies, items, and traps to help formulate a plan.</p>
<p>Disguises let you access areas that might otherwise be off-limits, but many of the guards can see through your outfits (not literally, cheeky) and discover your true identity. Instinct Mode comes into play here too, so by holding down ‘R’ while in an enemy's line of sight, you can make yourself inconspicuous enough to slip by.</p>
<p>Unlike World of Assassination, Instinct Mode is finite. Relying on it too much will deplete your supplies. Taking out guards and completing challenges will replenish it, but I advise using it sparingly and instead rely on your own senses to scope out opportunities; it’s much more fun that way.</p>
<p>Levels are overall smaller and more compact than what you might be used to. IO Interactive focuses a lot more on telling a coherent story, and it shows in the structure. In other Hitman titles, you’d spend a lot of time walking out in the open and blending into your surroundings, but in Absolution, sneaking around and hiding behind cover is generally more advisable thanks to the close-quarters environments.</p>
<p>This frustrated a lot of folks back in 2012, and the game was widely criticised for its overall linearity when compared to earlier entries. This hasn’t changed, but there’s still a decent amount of options available when deciding how to approach your targets. Know what you’re getting yourself into and you’ll have a good time.</p>
<p>Performance is exactly what I imagined it would be. You’re looking at 30fps with a few minor hitches here and there, particularly in dense crowds. Textures and assets have also been scaled back considerably, but it’s still a handsome game regardless, and the accompanying music is consistently great.</p>
<p>Feral has promised a free Switch 2 upgrade in 2026 along with an extra Contracts Mode, so if you’re happy to wait until then, then by all means do so. But Hitman: Absolution on Switch is solid, flaws and all.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hitman-absolution]]></content:encoded>
