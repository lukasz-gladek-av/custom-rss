            <p>
Throne and Liberty - the latest South Korean free-to-play fantasy MMO to land on Amazon Games' publishing slate following 2022's Lost Ark - will get worldwide release on 17th September, with an open beta coming to PC and consoles in July.
</p>
<p>
Developed by NCSoft, the company behind Guild Wars and City of Heroes, Throne and Liberty promises to be a game of exploration and "massive-scale combat" - accommodating "thousands of players at once" - all unfolding in the "dynamic" open world of Solisium.
</p>
<p>
"Adapt your fight to survive and thrive through strategic decisions in PvP, PvE or both as you encounter evolving battlefields impacted by weather, time of day, and other players", its promotion blurb explains. "There is no single path to victory as you seek to defeat Kazar and claim the throne while keeping rival guilds at bay."

<p>
Throne and Liberty's road to release begins this summer, with an open beta running 18th-23rd July in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. To participate, simply download the Open Beta Test client for Steam, Xbox Series X/S, or PlayStation 5 once the beta - an "opportunity to share feedback and shape the future" - gets underway.
</p>
<p>
After that, the next big date for Throne and Liberty's calendar is 17th September, when the MMO gets its full free-to-play launch across the same platforms (all supporting cross-play) and regions. A few additional details can be found on <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-gb">the Throne and Liberty website</a>.

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24181195/smile-2-trailer-release-date-cast-sequel-concert</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/smile-2-is-making-good-on-the-original%E2%80%99s-viral-marketing-gimmick.905283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181195/smile-2-trailer-release-date-cast-sequel-concert<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RojoXL">The first <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23368190/smile-review-horror-movie"><em>Smile </em>was a pretty good horror movie</a> and a pretty massive hit. While those two facts are closely related, at least part of the movie’s cultural impact was thanks to its incredible marketing campaign where people showed up to high-profile events like sports games sporting the series’ trademark unnatural grin. It didn’t have much to do with the movie, but it was undeniably effective. Thankfully, the first trailer for <em>Smile 2</em>, the series’ big-budget sequel, is here to make good on the original’s marketing stunt.</p>
<p id="ZqdMp4"><em>Smile </em>relied mostly on intimate, small-scale scares and the creepy idea that the person you’re talking to could be infected by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23409413/smile-monster-practical-effect-movie-ending-interview">Smile curse</a> without you even knowing it. The main character, Rose (Sosie Bacon), watched the curse spread through the various members of her life until she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23378979/smile-2022-horror-about-mental-illness">finally understood what was causing it</a>. </p>
<p id="zMbG7w">But the marketing campaign got at something much big and more sinister. Having normal(ish) people sitting at baseball games and grinning for the camera, implied something massive, an unknowable infection of sporadic unexplainable violence accompanied with an ear to ear smile and wide vacant eyes. Thankfully, this is the deep well that the new movie seems to be tapping into. </p>
<div id="rGhMzQ">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s some fun, clever movie promo - Paramount seemingly placed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Smile?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Smile</a> actors in the crowd at both the Yankees and Mets games last night, both in view of cameras. The results were indeed creepy. Going to a game this weekend? Watch out for the smiles!   <a href="https://t.co/aC3sqZjWvI">pic.twitter.com/aC3sqZjWvI</a></p>— Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikDavis/status/1573670514110889986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2022</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="AmpdMQ">The trailer for the new movie primarily follows pop star Skye Riley (Naomi Scott), who seems to be in the middle of a massive nation-wide stadium tour — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star">a popular venue for horror movies this year</a>. Of course, smiles start to creep through the crowd and her fans without any explanation, and violence follows. </p>
<p id="AVAP4T">It all looks far bigger and more expensive, but with the same <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23178743/smile-horror-movie-trailer-release-date-cast">methodical slow-paced scares that made the first movie so effective</a>. And, even more importantly, adding in throngs of people makes the series’ signature grins even more terrifying, making the cursed victims stand out in the crowd, exactly like they did at the baseball games from the original promotions. </p>
<p id="RCZgya"><em>Smile 2</em> is written and directed by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23374118/smile-ending-meaning-director-interview">Parker Finn</a>, just like the original movie, and is set for release in theaters on Oct. 18.</p>

Sorry to everyone affected and please know it’s totally out of our control!”</p><p>Officially licensed video game sheet music is often hard to come by, so it’s no surprise that dedicated fans have taken it upon themselves to try and fill that gap so that other musicians can learn and perform songs from their favorite Nintendo games. It is surprising, however, that Nintendo is only just now cracking down on these arrangements after they were apparently hosted on Musicnotes for several years.

We’ve reached out to Nintendo and Musicnotes for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</p><p>At the very least, both channels still have their Musicnotes accounts with most of their work still intact. Purpleschala primarily arranges songs for piano, while Sheet Music Boss has arrangements for piano, string, and wind instruments.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, a new top-down adventure starring Zelda (finally!), is set to release on September 26. To commemorate the new Zelda game, Nintendo is releasing a special-edition Switch Lite on the same day. There's no word yet on when preorders will go live, but we'll make sure to update this article as soon as they do. Price hasn't been revealed either, though last year's Animal Crossing-themed Switch Lite bundle--which is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Timmy-Tommy-s-Aloha-Edition-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Bundle-Full-Game-Download-Included%2F3162541096%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpreorder-legend-of-zelda-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-console%2F1100-6524361%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">still in stock at Walmart</a>--retailed for $200.</p><p>We'd expect this to be a hot commodity, so preorders will likely sell out fast. That means you'll need to reserve a unit as soon as possible if you want to have it in your hands while playing Echoes of Wisdom at launch.</p><p>The Hyrule Edition Nintendo Switch Lite is gold with black button and analog sticks. On the back, you'll find the Hylian Crest, while the front is adorned with a tiny Triforce below the right analog stick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4321008-nintendoswitchlitezelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321008" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4321008-nintendoswitchlitezelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321008"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch Lite - Hyrule Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4321008-nintendoswitchlitezelda.jpg"></figure><p>Aside from its slick new design, this is a standard Nintendo Switch Lite console. That means you're getting a 5.5-inch LCD touchscreen display, 32GB storage, and a battery that'll run for up to seven hours before needing a recharge. Keep in mind that Switch Lite can't be docked to a TV, though it supports nearly every game that the standard and OLED models play.</p><p>As an added bonus, the Hyrule Edition comes bundled with a 12-month individual <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836651782998675137%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpreorder-legend-of-zelda-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-console%2F1100-6524361%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership</a>. Typically sold for $50, the membership lets you access a wealth of classic games from Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, and the Game Boy family of systems. Switch Online also grants access to online multiplayer and cloud saves. Zelda: Four Swords, a GBA multiplayer game, was just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-adding-more-gba-and-n64-games-today-including-zelda-and-perfect-dark/1100-6517710/" data-ref-id="1100-6517710">added to Switch Online</a>, joining an assortment of other classic Zelda games.</p><p>The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite doesn't come with Echoes of Wisdom. Preorders for the new game aren't live yet either, but we'll have a dedicated preorder guide for Echoes of Wisdom when listings start popping up.</p><p>The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite is the second Zelda-themed Switch console. In 2023, Nintendo released a special-edition Switch OLED console in the lead-up to Tears of the Kingdom's launch. The Zelda-themed Switch OLED has gold Joy-Con controls, a gold-accented pattern on the back panel, and a white Switch dock featuring the Triforce. It's worth noting you can pick up the Japanese version of the console--which can be set to English and plays all North American Switch releases (the Switch is region-free)--for $294 at Walmart ($66 off its original $360 list price). Alternatively, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Model-Legend-Kingdom-Renewed/dp/B0C5K4NFPY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy a refurbished North American edition of the console in "excellent" condition at Amazon</a> for $319.</p><p>Echoes of Time retains the adorable graphical style of the Link's Awakening remake for Switch.

                <p>It has been more than 15 years since the Nintendo Wii got Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, bringing a supposed end to Samus Aran's first-person adventures. However, Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017, instantly becoming one of the Nintendo Switch's most anticipated games despite fans only knowing the name and the logo. In the years since, we have heard very little about the game's progress, though it now appears to be on track for a 2025 release again. Here is what we know about Metroid Prime 4 so far.</p><h2 id="Release_date">Release date</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not revealed a specific release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4/">Metroid Prime 4</a>, but it has narrowed it down to a release window. At the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">showed a new trailer</a> that debuted the new title, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and announced it's coming in 2025. Prior to that, Nintendo had simply stating that the game was "in development" during E3 2017 before later offering an apology for the wait back in 2019, and then subsequently missing that window as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_we_know_so_far">What we know so far</h2><p dir="ltr">In the grand scheme of things, the real answer is "almost nothing," but there are a few things we've come to understand about Metroid Prime 4's development.</p><p dir="ltr">According to reports, Metroid Prime 4's development initially began under Bandai Namco rather than an internal Nintendo studio, but Nintendo was unhappy with the game's quality at the time. It announced early in 2019 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">development was restarting</a>, this time via Retro Studios, the American studio behind the first three Metroid Prime games. Producer Kensuke Tanabe, who also served in this role on the first three games and Metroid Prime: Hunters, is back, as well. While these developments bode well for the game's final quality, it doesn't give us any indication of when it will be ready to be shown again.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what Metroid Prime 4 will be about, once again we don't have a whole lot to go off of. At the end of Metroid 3: Corruption, Dark Samus and Phazon were both defeated, leaving Samus ready to move on to the next big challenge the universe decides to throw her way.</p><p dir="ltr">And while the latest trailer doesn't tell us much about the story, it did show Samus showing up to a planet that appears to be a warzone between different alien factions. The trailer showed series mainstays like scanning and lock-on targeting for enemies, along with a mysterious villain who appeared to be flanked by two metroids.</p><p dir="ltr">To catch up on the story, be sure to read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-the-series-story-so-far/1100-6524350/" data-ref-id="1100-6524350">Metroid Prime story primer</a> for all the details on where Samus has been in this series, along with some speculation about where it could go next.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Platforms">Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">This was one of the few aspects of Metroid Prime 4 that seemed certain in the past, that Metroid Prime 4 was destined to appear on Nintendo Switch. Now that it has a 2025 release date, it is possible that Metroid Prime 4 will be a swan song for the Switch or a cross-generation release between Switch and Nintendo's next console.</p><h2 dir="ltr"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/fantasian-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-considers-the-rpgs-wider-release-a-blessing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fantasian-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-considers-the-rpgs-wider-release-a-blessing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy </em>creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and his team at Mistwalker, including legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu, combined forces once again to unleash <em>Fantasian </em>on Apple Arcade in two parts in 2021. Naturally, that means the audience was inherently limited, but now that it’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mistwalker-rpg-fantasian-neo-dimension-coming-to-consoles-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally expanding to other platforms</a>, Sakaguchi shared some thoughts.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Fantasian_EN/status/1803095592400474258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> on <em>Fantasian</em>‘s official English social accounts, Sakaguchi started off by saying that he always wanted <em>Fantasian </em>to be an “especially long-standing title,” and he cites that longevity as one of the strengths of digital games. “I developed <em>Fantasian </em>thinking that it could become my final work before retiring, so it has a special place in my heart,” he continued.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="593" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">Sakaguchi added that being able to rebuild <em>Fantasian </em>at Square Enix and offer it to a wider audience is “truly a blessing.” Beyond the exploration and turn-based combat, a lot of the appeal of <em>Fantasian </em>comes down to its beautifully bespoke nature. The backgrounds consist of hand-crafted dioramas, over 150 of which were scanned into the game. Sakaguchi closed out his statement with a nod to all this loving, laborious work, saying, “This title is an amalgamation of the souls of the diorama craftsmen, Uematsu compositions, and of course, the game developers.”&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-soul-of-fantasy" data-injectable="false"><strong>The soul of fantasy</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">Square Enix is helping Sakaguchi and his team revitalize the RPG as <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>. The new version keeps the story and gameplay intact while adding in some additional features, including English and Japanese voiceovers and more difficulty options. It’s currently set for a 2024 release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">As great as exclusives can be, it’s even better when more people have a chance to enjoy a game you’ve worked so hard on over the years. Here’s hoping this is far from Sakaguchi’s final fantasy.</p>

<p data-characters="412" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Vincent D’Onofrio, who portrayed Kingpin/Wilson Fisk in Netflix’s <em>Daredevil</em> and Marvel Studios’ <em>Echo</em>, has shared his thoughts on the complexity of the situation between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. D’Onofrio feels unsure at the moment about how and where the future of Wilson Fisk will be and explains that it is due to the interchanging rights of the characters between Sony and Marvel.</p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">The actor shared his thoughts on the situation amid rumors of his involvement in the upcoming Disney+ show called<em> Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em>. Charlie Cox is already confirmed to be reprising his role as Daredevil in the animated series.</p> <figure data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Marvel Studios' Echo | The Legendary Kingpin | Disney+ &amp; Hulu" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqjE056Dh6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">“I’m going to transparently say this: You know the whole Marvel-Sony thing, right? So there are characters — Marvel characters invented by Marvel, written by Marvel — that are caught in between Marvel and Sony,” explained the actor at the Fan Expo Boston, as reported by <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/daredevil-vincent-donofrio-kingpin-rights-marvel-sony-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-animated-series/">Comic Book</a>.</p> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">Vincent D’Onofrio also added that this setup between the two companies is why “it takes a long time for them to figure out who is doing what.” As for where Kingpin can show up, he said that he never really knows where it may happen.</p>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">“My character is in that kind of situation, unlike Charlie’s [Charlie Cox]. So I don’t know, it’s part of the deal when it comes to playing Kingpin,” said Vincent D’Onofrio.</p> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="false">While Kingpin has been introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe through <em>Hawkeye</em> and <em>Echo</em>, Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin will be in the spotlight once again in the upcoming <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> show. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is slated for a release in March 2025.</p>

<p id="0TA8Q9">Of course, if you’d like to dodge the interpersonal drama, this bundle also includes farming sims like <em>Wylde Flowers</em> and <em>Lakeburg Legacies</em> in addition to its collection of excellent visual novels.</p>

<p id="17VJcF">As with other Humble Bundles, by default a portion of the sale goes to benefit a non-profit — in this case, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>, a foundation dedicated to ending self-harm among LGBTQ youth by providing access to crisis services and peer support. Just remember you can always use the “Adjust Donation” drop-down menu to fine-tune how much goes to the publisher, the charity in question, and Humble.</p>

Ever since, fans have been desperate for a taste of what Retro Studios has been working on. The result was years of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DailyPrime4News/status/1768334142792491279&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DailyPrime4News/status/1768334142792491279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no news</a></span>” on the upcoming first-person shooter with the exception of that one time Nintendo revealed that development had been re-booted.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-switch-retro-studios-1848510132&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-switch-retro-studios-1848510132"> Then today</a></span>, fans received not just a gameplay trailer and 2025 release window, but over a dozen screenshots full of clues for them to spend the next several months devouring like a pack of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Zoomer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Zoomer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rabid Zoomers</a></span>. </p><p>The trailer showed space pirates and what looked like a Galactic Federation base. It’s unclear what everyone’s doing there or what new powers Samus will wield this time around. Today’s brief look mostly teased the existing arsenal the bounty hunter’s had all throughout the previous entries in the <em>Prime</em> subseries, including beam weapons, missiles, environmental scanners, and her iconic Morph Ball ability. For the most part, <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> definitely looks a whole lot like <em>Metroid Prime</em>, with some shots buzzing with space alien possibilities and others feeling surprisingly bland and muted for a game that’s been in development for close to a decade. </p><p>Will <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> be one of the first cross-gen games to appear on Switch 2 as well? Maybe even with a few visual enhancements, including better framerates and some ray-tracing-lite feature? We’ll find out as its 2025 release window gets closer. In the meantime, here’s a look at all of the screenshots Nintendo curated from <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>'s triumphant return to the online showcase hype-cycle. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-fans-are-already-theorizing-when-and-where-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-place<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The timeline discussion comes for us all.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">Nintendo announced The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom today, </a>and you know what that means: timeline speculation. X/Twitter and Reddit are lighting up with speculation about where, exactly, Echoes of Wisdom falls in Zelda's complicated history. </p><p>On r/Zelda, a thread titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/eow_idk_if_this_was_obvious_bu_the_game_uses_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[EOW] Idk if this was obvious, bu the game uses the map from ALTTP/ALBW</a>" popped up almost immediately. The thread pointed out that, based on what we've seen so far, several parts of Hyrule line up nicely with the map from A Link to the Past and A Link Between Worlds. However, the map isn't a 1:1: Death Mountain, as thread creator u/FelipeKits points out, is in the wrong place. We also saw a Gerudo in the trailer, who do not appear in the Fallen Hero/Downfall timeline, which kicks off if Link loses to Ganondorf during their final encounter in Ocarina of Time. </p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/comment/l9604ix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">u/scdsco</a> points out that many of the things we saw simply aren't in A Link to the Past: "There were lots of areas in the trailer and official art that don’t exist in alttp, like a rainforest area, a volcano, a gerudo town and an icy mountain."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zelda2-1718735700533.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/eow_idk_if_this_was_obvious_bu_the_game_uses_the/">u/FelipeKits on Reddit</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>In another thread titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/eow_echoes_of_wisdom_a_link_to_the_past_maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[EoW] Echoes of Wisdom &amp; A Link to the Past Maps</a>," u/Ryon21_ posted a more detailed comparison between the A Link to the Past and Echoes of Wisdom maps, theorizing that Echoes of the Wind's map is an expansion of A Link to the Past's, with new areas to the west and northwest of the original.</p><p>One of the most interesting tidbits, however, is that Echoes of Wisdom includes both of the series' Zora designs, which marks the first time both have appeared in a single game. The decision to include both types of Zoras (ahem) echoes the merging of several elements that had previously been exclusive to a single branch of the timeline, something we also saw in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which take place long, long after any other game currently on the timeline.</p><p>At this moment, signs seem to point to Echoes of Wisdom taking place somewhere in the Fallen Hero/Downfall timeline. Some fans, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/comment/l95zkt4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like u/ZeldaExpert74</a>, theorize that it's actually the start of the Fallen Hero/Downfall timeline, taking place between Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past. Other theories place Echoes of Wisdom between A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening, or after A Link Between Worlds and Tri Force Heroes. These connections make sense: Echoes of Wisdom's art style is essentially the same as the Link's Awakening remake on Switch. If nothing else, everyone seems to agree on one thing: it's not part of the Wind Waker branch of the timeline.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zelda-1718735740956.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Fans are already cooking up theories on where and when Echoes of Wisdom takes place.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While speculation is fun, it's also worth noting that Nintendo seems rather... disinterested in the Zelda timeline of late. The publisher hasn't officially placed a new game on the timeline in nearly a decade, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/the-legend-of-zelda-tri-force-heroes-place-in-series-timeline-revealed">though series producer Eiji Anouma did confirm that the Link from A Link Between Worlds is the same one that appears in Tri Force Heroes.</a> Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feature elements from every timeline, so perhaps things merge in the future. Perhaps Echoes of Wisdom takes place closer to them than it does any other previous game? So far, Nintendo isn't saying. Maybe they aren't even thinking about the timeline anymore. Who knows?</p><p>While timeline speculation can be fun, it's important to remember that Zelda is a myth, or perhaps, more accurately, a legend retold over and over again, passed down across generations. While there's certainly continuity to be found, the timeline isn't as important as the series' anthology mindset and enduring spirit. You don't need to play a previous Zelda to understand a new one, and you won't need to understand where Echoes of Wisdom falls in the series' history to enjoy playing a Zelda for the first time. So by all means, speculate, but don't be surprised if Nintendo never give us an official answer as to where it falls on the timeline.</p><p>Will Borger is an IGN freelancer.

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Activision Blizzard has revealed that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a></em> will receive a <em>Fallout</em> Bundle later this week and that a crossover event will see players earn <em>Fallout</em>-themed cosmetics and additional XP as they battle to save the world in style. </p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">The <em>Call of Duty X Fallout Bundl</em>e will drop in <em>Call of Duty: MW3</em> this week on <strong>Thursday, June 20, 2024</strong>. It adds more than 15 new items to the game, all based on the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-fallout-is-written-for-two-audiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> franchise</a>. I don’t know about you, but it takes a lot for a game to sell me on cosmetics, and having those cosmetics themed around one of my favorite universes is a great way to convince me to spend money. </p> <h2 id="h-worlds-collide-as-the-dwellers-from-vault-141-emerge-in-call-of-duty-mw3" data-injectable="false">Worlds collide as the Dwellers from Vault 141 emerge in <em>Call of Duty: MW3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="COD x Fallout Bundle | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Modern Warfare III" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gm2Fj9JtCZs?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">The <em>Call of Duty X Fallout Bundle</em> is almost here. When it arrives on Thursday, you’ll have access to a suite of new cosmetics that bring the <em>Fallout</em> franchise into <em>Call of Duty.</em> See below for a list of most of the items on offer in the bundle.</p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Four “Vault 141” Operator Skins</strong></li> <li><strong>“Atomic Disintegrator” HRM-9 Weapon Blueprint</strong></li> <li><strong>“Vault-Tec Approved” M16 Weapon Blueprint</strong></li> <li><strong>“Let’s Do This!” and “Fatman” Charms</strong></li> <li><strong>“Wasteland Workshop” Calling Card</strong></li> <li><strong>“You’re Special” Large Decal</strong></li> <li><strong>“Vault-Tec Engineer” Emblem</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola Spacer” Sticker</strong></li> <li><strong>Six Loading Screens including “Nuka-Cola,” “Please Stand By,” “Survivors’ Journey,” “Sanctuary Hills,” “Vault 141,” and “Restoring Democracy”</strong></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">What you can see in the trailer is the “Vault-Tec Approved” M16 Weapon Blueprint, which transforms your M16 into something that Vault-Tec would definitely issue in this day and age. It’s blue, yellow, and dons the Vault 141 iconography, just in case there was any wonder where you popped up from. </p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">In addition to the new cosmetics, all players can participate in the Fallout: Vault Dwellers Event, which arrives with the bundle. this will add new challenges for players to complete, and anyone wearing the new gear can earn additional XP for a limited time. Players can earn the following bonus items by participating in the event, which runs from <strong>June 20 to June 28, 2024</strong>.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>“New California Republic” Large Decal</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola Caps” Emblem</strong></li> <li><strong>“Slocum’s Joe” Sticker</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola” Charm</strong></li> <li><strong>“Nuka-Cola Quantum” Weapon Camo</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="false">Perhaps the best part of this bundle is that it adds Vault-Tec Tracers and V.A.T.S. Death Effect to the game. These are the closest thing you’ll get to seeing V.A.T.S. in <em>Call of Duty</em>, and based on how those green bullets look in the trailer, I think they’re going to please a lot of <em>Fallout</em> fans when they arrive. Just remember that they won’t actually pause the action, and you’ve got to aim at enemy body parts manually. </p>

But if you want some tips on which weapons to favor for Cloud, read on.</p><h2 id="h2885"><a id=""></a>It’s gotta be the Slipstream Saber, right?

But before we dip into those, let’s cover how and why you may want to stick to Cloud’s late-game sword. </p><p>First, the Slipstream Saber’s Attack Damage +5% weapon upgrade is an excellent boost to Cloud’s overall damage output. Combine this with Unrelenting Punisher and Formidable Counter upgrades to increase the amount of slashes you can do in Punisher mode and Punisher’s counter damage by 15-percent, respectively.</p><p>Why do you want to prioritize these boosts? Because when you combine them with the Slipstream’s three-pairs of combined materia slots, you’re dramatically expanding Cloud’s potential magic abilities (or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-assess-1851364040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-rebirth-materia-assess-1851364040">any other materia combo</a></span>) with amplified attack power by means of an OP Punisher set up. </p><p>Other blades will help you double down on either magic or physical damage, but Slipstream is exceedingly efficient at splitting the difference.</p><h2 id="h2886"><a id=""></a>Smack stuff good with the Igneous Saber</h2><p>It may be a goofy-lookin’ thing, but the Igneous Saber (found in Mt. Nibel in Chapter 11) is a devastatingly powerful sword for all-out physical damage. Though they’re not all connected like in the Slipstream Saber, the Igneous Saber packs six materia slots (two connected, four solitary), so you have room to mix and match materia to either fortify Cloud’s physical stats or give him some rad spells.</p><p>For weapon upgrade slots, I recommend going with Enemy Parts Damage Up, which juices damage to individual enemy body parts (a great feature for many boss battles in <em>Rebirth</em>) in addition to Stalwart and Unrelenting Punisher to take full advantage of Cloud’s alternate battle stance.</p><h2 id="h2887"><a id=""></a>Amplify Cloud’s magical talents with the Rune Blade</h2><p>If you’re looking to mix things up and send Cloud down a spellcasting path, the Rune Blade is where you want to start. Though it’s only got five materia slots (two pairs of which are combo slots), it makes up for it with the highest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434">magical damage</a></span> bonus of all of Cloud’s swords.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-fire-ice-lightning-wind-1851359434"><em>FF7 Rebirth</em>’s Best Materia For Dealing Magic Damage</a></span></p><p>But a high magic stat isn’t the only thing the Rune Blade has going for it. For upgrades, we can improve Cloud’s magic damage-dealing capabilities by going with Magic Attack Power +20, ATB Charge Up (which will see him casting spells faster), and Full-Power Magic, which deals more damage when casting a spell at full MP.</p><h2 id="h2888"><a id=""></a>Use abilities even faster with the Sleek Saber</h2><p>The Sleek Saber is likely to be the very first new blade you’ll unlock for Cloud as it’s found in the second chapter. Odds are it will get outpaced in terms of damage output and materia slots very quickly, but don’t be so quick to toss it. With the ability to stack two ATB Charge Rate Up upgrades (which collectively raise your ATB meter speed by 20 percent) and the Weapon Ability ATB Recovery upgrade, this is an excellent sword to use to keep Cloud dishing out ATB abilities. </p><p>I highly recommend equipping Cloud with First Strike and ATB Boost materia in combination with the Sleek Saber to get even more out of your ATB usage.</p><hr><p>With so many weapons and endless materia combinations, it’s tough to pinpoint a “best” build for Cloud. <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> is a very flexible and customizable RPG, so you can put together all manner of builds for different situations. That said, you can’t go wrong with these weapons and upgrade configurations. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been been waiting for news on the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition you don’t have to wait much longer. Ubisoft announced via social media that more information on the game is coming on Thursday, June 20 as part of the Limited Run Games Showcase.</p>



<p>The showcase starts at 2pm ET on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Looks like Uncle Pey’j has a message to share with you all… See you at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20th at 2pm EST for more news about Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition,” Ubisoft said.</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Uncle Pey'j has a message to share with you all…<br>See you at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20th at 2pm EST for more news about Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition! 👉 : <a href="https://t.co/zaLKVRlN2A">https://t.co/zaLKVRlN2A</a> Big thanks to Hubert Chevillard for this little teaser😀 <a href="https://t.co/dY2PqL2JWn">pic.twitter.com/dY2PqL2JWn</a></p>— Beyond Good and Evil 2 (@bgegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgegame/status/1803095350950949107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Recently, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20-anniversary-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies appeared online</a>. It also came after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early versions of the game</a> were accidentally shared with players. The game is expected to launch sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>“Swoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Pey’j or the valiant Double H,” the game’s description reads. </p>



<p>“Armed with her daï-jo and faithful camera, Jade’s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience.”</p>



<p>As far as Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, that game remains in limbo with no update from Ubisoft in recent years. The last we learned about the game was that its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio went through shakeups</a> with the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-still-in-early-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development struggling</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Metroid Prime 4 has finally been given a proper unveiling, now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">renamed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and with an announced release planned for 2025. With the long-awaited release finally on its way, it's worth taking a look back at the story of the other Prime games. And for more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/" data-ref-id="2900-5478">all the biggest Nintendo Direct announcements</a>.</em></p><p>It’s been more than five years now since Nintendo shockingly revealed it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">restarting development</a> on Metroid Prime 4. In that span of time, the company has announced and released two high-profile Metroid games for Switch in Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime Remastered, keeping the series in the spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Although we currently know very little about the story of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, one thing we can infer is that it will go in a different direction from previous titles. The first three installments in the Metroid Prime saga all revolved around Phazon, a mysterious radioactive substance capable of destroying the galaxy. Over the course of the original trilogy, Samus traveled to multiple planets afflicted by the mutagen to eliminate the corrupting substance and prevent it from falling into Space Pirate hands, culminating in a climactic confrontation against recurring nemesis Dark Samus on the Phazon homeworld.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Phazon saga firmly wrapped up, Metroid Prime 4 will likely pit the bounty hunter against some new galactic threat, but there are a few lingering story threads from previous games that may give us a hint as to what--or who--that could be. In the meantime, here’s a recap of the entire Metroid Prime saga up until now to refresh your memory as we await more news on Metroid Prime 4.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Spoilers for the first three Metroid Prime games follow.</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">First Encounter (Metroid Prime)</h2><p dir="ltr">Though we don’t yet know where Metroid Prime 4 will fall in the series’ timeline, the entire Metroid Prime saga thus far takes place between the first Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus.</p><p dir="ltr">The story begins shortly after the events of the original Metroid. Several months after defeating Mother Brain and halting the Space Pirates’ operations on Zebes, Samus intercepts a distress signal from a derelict frigate orbiting the planet Tallon IV. Upon arriving, she discovers the ship is actually a Space Pirate research vessel, wherein the Pirates had been conducting experiments with a strange, newly discovered mutagen known as Phazon. In the course of her investigation, Samus comes face-to-face with one of these test subjects: the Parasite Queen, a monstrous creature that escaped captivity and has been wreaking havoc aboard the frigate. Samus is able to subdue the monster, but in the process inadvertently triggers the ship’s self-destruct sequence.</p><p dir="ltr">En route back to her gunship, the bounty hunter encounters her nemesis Ridley, revived and cybernetically augmented since their confrontation on Zebes. She pursues the dragon to Tallon IV, a lush natural world once occupied by the Chozo--the highly advanced bird-like race that raised Samus and developed her Power Suit. As with the Space Pirate frigate, Samus arrives to find Tallon IV eerily deserted. The Chozo, ravaged by some unseen force, have since vanished from the planet, with only the remnants of their once great civilization left to mark their presence.</p><p dir="ltr">The murals left behind by the Chozo chronicle the arrival of a great “poison” that reached Tallon IV via meteor and seeped into the very heart of the planet. Though the Chozo did their best to contain the corrupting force within the meteor’s impact crater, their efforts were ultimately futile, and the substance--Phazon--slowly spread and decimated their civilization. Lured by the prospect of harnessing this mutagen for their own ends, the Space Pirates arrived on Tallon IV some time before Samus and established various facilities across the planet to further mine and experiment with Phazon.</p><p dir="ltr">During the course of her mission, Samus eventually gains a Phazon-enhanced Power Suit, allowing her to enter the impact crater and confront the source of the mutagen: Metroid Prime. Partway through the climactic final battle, Samus destroys Metroid Prime’s exoskeleton to reveal its core form--a nebulous being made of pure Phazon. Samus ultimately defeats the creature, but in its death throes, it latches onto and absorbs her Phazon Suit as the impact crater begins to cave in.</p><p dir="ltr">The bounty hunter flees the site before it collapses, her mission to rid the planet of its corruption finally accomplished. However, this isn’t the last she’s seen of Phazon or Metroid Prime. After Samus departs Tallon IV, the scene shifts back to the impact crater, where a hand is seen emerging from Metroid Prime’s bubbling remains--confirming the creature survived by reconstituting with the stolen Phazon Suit.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1222970657" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

receives a missive from the Galactic Federation to investigate Aether--a windswept planet on the outskirts of a neighboring star system. One month prior, a squadron of Galactic Federations soldiers was dispatched to Aether to pursue a Space Pirate vessel. However, communications with the squadron suddenly went dark, prompting the Federation to enlist Samus to locate the soldiers and render assistance.</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after arriving on Aether, Samus discovers the remains of the missing GF soldiers, slaughtered in an ambush by a pack of shadowy, interdimensional beings known as the Ing. The Ing’s ephemeral forms allow them to possess other lifeforms, including the deceased troopers, and they inhabit the fallen corpses and launch a surprise attack on Samus. The bounty hunter is able to defeat the reanimated soldiers, but soon afterward encounters a mysterious doppelganger who leads her through a strange portal, where she is once again ambushed by the Ing.</p><p dir="ltr">Having narrowly escaped the attack, Samus makes her way to the Great Temple at the heart of the planet, where she meets U-Mos, the leader of the peaceful Luminoth. U-Mos entreats Samus for her aid, explaining that Aether has suffered a similar fate as Tallon IV. Several decades ago, the planet was struck by a meteor carrying Phazon, contaminating and slowly poisoning the Luminoth’s homeworld. The impact was so great that it also caused a dimensional rift to form, cleaving Aether into two halves: a “light” world and a “dark” mirror dimension where the hostile Ing reside. The shadowy creatures have since been waging war against the Luminoth in an attempt to conquer the planet, and without Samus’s assistance, Aether will become enveloped by its dark half.</p><p dir="ltr">Complicating matters, the presence of Phazon has also drawn the attention of the Space Pirates, who have set up mining operations across Aether to extract the mutagen. As Samus travels across the planet thwarting the Space Pirates’ machinations, she once again encounters her mysterious doppelganger, Dark Samus--the reborn form of Metroid Prime. Lured to Aether by its rich Phazon deposits, Dark Samus has been ransacking the Space Pirates’ facilities and absorbing the mutagen to regain strength, leading to multiple confrontations with Samus.</p><p dir="ltr">The bounty hunter ultimately reaches the Ing’s stronghold deep in the heart of Dark Aether, where she does battle with the species’ progenitor, the Emperor Ing. After defeating the shadowy beast, she is ambushed one final time by Dark Samus, now composed purely of Phazon energy. Samus overcomes her clone and returns to her gunship before Dark Aether implodes, fulfilling her mission and restoring order to the planet. As before, however, the story does not end there. In the game’s secret ending, Dark Samus is seen reforming in space, ready to return again.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Source Of Phazon (Metroid Prime 3: Corruption)</h2><p dir="ltr">Six months after her expedition on Aether, Samus is enlisted once more by the Galactic Federation. The Federation’s Aurora Units, a network of organic supercomputers stationed across various planets, have been infected by a virus, and Samus is tasked with working alongside three other renowned bounty hunters to help cure it. Before the mission can get underway, however, the Space Pirates launch an attack on a Federation base on the planet Norion. Samus and the other hunters travel to the base and successfully thwart the Pirates, but the group are ambushed by the revived Dark Samus, who infects each of the hunters with Phazon.</p><p dir="ltr">Samus awakens one month after the attack, now outfitted with a specialized Power Suit that can utilize the Phazon coursing within her body for a temporary boost in strength. The Federation informs Samus that the Phazon-bearing meteors that struck Tallon IV and Aether were not random acts of nature, but a deliberate effort to spread Phazon across the galaxy. These living meteors, dubbed Leviathans, originated from a radioactive planet called Phaaze, and three more were recently observed hurtling toward the nearby planets Bryyo, Elysia, and the Space Pirate homeworld.</p><p dir="ltr">The other three bounty hunters, having awoken before Samus, were each dispatched to a different planet to investigate the Leviathans. However, communication with the hunters was lost several days ago, and it now falls to Samus to determine their whereabouts. As the bounty hunter travels from planet to planet, she discovers that each of her former comrades has succumbed to their Phazon corruption and gone mad. Samus has no choice but to defeat the other bounty hunters and destroy the Leviathans impacted in each of the planets, ridding them of the Phazon threat.</p><p dir="ltr">With the other Leviathans successfully dispatched, Samus travels to Phaaze for a climactic final confrontation with Dark Samus. The doppelganger fuses with the planet’s corrupted Aurora Unit, but Samus ultimately prevails, defeating Dark Samus once and for all. With the supercomputer now destroyed as well, the entire planet begins to self-destruct, eliminating Phazon from the galaxy for good.</p><p dir="ltr">However, a new threat appears to be looming in the shadows. As Samus sets off for her next destination, she’s tailed by a mysterious gunship resembling the one piloted by Sylux, one of the enemy hunters introduced in the offshoot game Metroid Prime Hunters. Very little is known about this cryptic warrior, but he harbors a deep disdain for the Galactic Federation and Samus, and his appearance in Metroid Prime 3’s secret ending suggests he may play a pivotal role in the series’ next installment.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not that will be the case. While Metroid Prime 3 ended with a tantalizing tease as to where the story could go from here, Retro Studios may well take the narrative in a different direction. As it stands, it’s currently our only hint as to what we can expect in Metroid Prime 4, but with any luck, we won’t have to wait too much longer until Nintendo finally sheds more light on the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj2y3bO-LxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yj2y3bO-LxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181118/sony-playstation-portal-public-wifi-battery-touchpads-software-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> is getting a couple of modest features it should have had in the first place. Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/18/new-playstation-portal-remote-player-system-software-update-releases-tomorrow/">announced on its PlayStation Blog</a> that a software update for its handheld remote player will allow users to connect their devices to public Wi-Fi networks that require sign-in, like free ones found at hotels and cafes.</p><p>Also in this update are new visual cues when you tap or swipe the emulated touchpad areas on the Portal’s screen and the option to see a battery percentage indicator in the top-right status bar. Up until now, the battery level was only indicated by some fairly vague bars, and the actual battery percentage number only shows when the Portal is fully turned off and charging.</p><div><figcaption><em>A battery level: how novel! Now, how about adding multiuser support?</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: PlayStation</cite></p></div><p>Just as the PlayStation Portal is useless on its own (you also need your PlayStation 5 to Remote Play the games from), the new Wi-Fi sign-in won’t work without a second device. Sony indicates the Portal will generate an onscreen QR code to scan with your phone to sign in to those public networks. But hey, it’s better than being stuck at a Target while you wait for your prescription to be filled and <em>not </em>being able to get in a round of <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>The thought of playing an online shooter like that on public Wi-Fi may sound like a lag nightmare, but Sony’s blog post also shed some light on the games people are playing on the Portal — and it includes twitchy multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> in addition to PlayStation first-party staples like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5"><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></a>. </p><p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/18/new-playstation-portal-remote-player-system-software-update-releases-tomorrow/">PlayStation Blog</a> also vaguely alluded to the Portal being a surprise hit, though no sales numbers were indicated. This new public Wi-Fi feature update is likely in response to users taking their Portals outside of the home networks the handhelds were designed to be used on. Additionally, the blog post claims that Portal owners are often discovering Remote Play for the first time and that their overall PS5 game time increased within the first couple of months of Portal ownership. </p><p>That sounds to me like there’s some validity to the Portal’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17uku57/lets_go_ahead_and_nickname_this_thing_the/">unofficial moniker</a> as the “ParentStation” / “DadStation” (since freeing up the family TV for the kids makes it easier to get back to a long-dormant PS5). It’s also just further proof that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23948529/nintendo-switch-steam-deck-handheld-consoles-gaming">handhelds</a> really are so hot right now — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175149/xbox-handheld-phil-spencer-interview-2024">everybody wants them</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> just around the corner, players may be having flashbacks to the terrible congestion during <em>Endwalker</em>’s Early Access period. If you’re worried, a <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/655f2cdb22f4c473e4f34abf58e9d4042f7e3ea3">Lodestone</a> post from earlier today may ease those fears. </p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">After director and producer Naoki Yoshida explained how server congestion shouldn’t be too much of an issue this time around, something which I find difficult to believe, there may be some hope on the horizon. However, if things go as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/psa-final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-login-queues-are-in-full-force/">sideways</a> as they did during <em>Endwalker</em>’s release, there’s some advice direct from the <em>FFXIV</em> team.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">Login queues happen when a world is simply too full to accommodate all of the players who are trying to log in at once. As such, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> has implemented countermeasures to try and lessen the pain for Version 7.0. From new and probationary worlds on both <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-dynamis-dc-to-get-four-new-worlds-including-fresh-new-housing-up-for-grabs/">North American</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-new-european-data-center-to-be-added-in-preparation-for-dawntrail/">European</a> Data Centers, to opening up <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-begins-testing-cross-region-data-center-travel-later-this-month/">Cross-Region Data Center Travel</a>.</p>
 <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/all-data-centers.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">However, if your character is logged in on any other world than their home world once 7.0 maintenance begins on June 26, you may be at a disadvantage. Priority will be given to those who are attempting to log in to their home world rather than those trying to log in to any world other than their own. To prevent being locked out of the game, it’s recommended that all players return to their home world before maintenance begins.</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">If you do face a huge queue to login during Early Access, it’s advised to at least try to log in on less populated worlds, such as the new North American worlds or probationary European worlds. Failing that, all players will have the option to login on Oceanian servers by using the Cross-Region Data Center Travel option.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">Peak congestion times are expected to be 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. EST for North America and between 12 p.m. to 11 p.m. GMT for Europe, so if you can avoid trying to log in during these times, then it might be for the best. If you do manage to login earlier and hope to stay online throughout the day, you’ll need to bear in mind that you’ll be automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">It remains to be seen whether the countermeasures will have an impact on login times, or whether <em>Dawntrail</em>’s release will be subject to the same issues faced during the release of <em>Endwalker</em>. I’m hoping for an improvement, however small.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="392" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Science fiction is one of the most incredible genres in books, taking players throughout other worlds, cultures, and galaxies. Though there are some rightfully popular sci-fi books like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Ender’s Game</em>, there are also some hidden gems in the mix. These 10 most underrated sci-fi books rival the giants of the genre in terms of storytelling, world-building, characters, lore, and more.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-10-beggars-in-spain" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/QtsjEb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">10. <em>Beggars in Spain</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">Nancy Kress crafted this <a href="https://geni.us/QtsjEb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">disturbing look</a> at the future of genetic modification with a series revolving around the “Sleepless.” These Sleepless are modified to not need sleep, allowing them to put the otherwise wasted time into learning and working. Discrimination, inequality, and other familiar factors play into this fascinating sci-fi take on the year 2020. </p>

It has one of the most unique takes on first contact with aliens compared to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-thriller-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most science fiction books</a>, centering around the medically-focused space station. Rather than war or hostility, this Hospital Station acts as humanity’s peaceful attempt to connect with aliens. This leads to a refreshingly light-hearted and often funny take on sci-fi.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-8-off-armageddon-reef" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/68KS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">8. <em>Off Armageddon Reef</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">Few sci-fi novels capture the depth of religion and humanity as well as <em><a href="https://geni.us/68KS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Off Armageddon Reef</a></em>. The story starts after the near-extinction of humanity in the far future at the hands of an alien race, leading the survivors to create a religious-centric society devoid of technology. The connections between the lead characters and the rich look at the effects of manipulation on the human mind is thought-provoking.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-hollow-world" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/mN7tQah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">7. <em>Hollow World</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="750" data-injectable="true">So many great science fiction novels expand into numerous different sequels and spin-offs, but <em><a href="https://geni.us/mN7tQah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hollow World</a> </em>stands out with its standalone structure. You can read this one book and have a complete, outstanding time. The story revolves around a terminally ill man who builds a time machine to cure his sickness and ends up in a futuristic utopian society. His exploration of himself and his new land is surprisingly heartwarming and character-driven. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-6-engine-summer" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/zbADicS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">6. <em>Engine Summer</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/zbADicS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Engine Summer</a></em> is the type of sci-fi novel to read that has a slow burn but envelops the reader in its unbelievably detailed world and characters. The story is told in four seemingly separate chapters from the lens of its protagonist in the midst of a post-apocalyptic world. The four sections of the protagonist’s life seem so disconnected initially but come together in a beautiful way in the finale.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-eifelheim" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/1vaJsm7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">5. <em>Eifelheim</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">This <a href="https://geni.us/1vaJsm7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">novel</a> presents one of the most original stories of alien discovery, revolving around a small German town in the 14th century. The townsfolk encounter aliens amidst the raging Black Death in Europe, which leads to deep science and even some intriguing ideas about how religion and aliens mix together. The more medieval-style sci-fi vibe is unmatched. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-you-feel-it-just-below-the-ribs" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/hpYnAl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">4. <em>You Feel It Just Below the Ribs</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">Set in the far future, this <a href="https://geni.us/hpYnAl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">novel</a> focuses on Miriam, a researcher who survives a decades-long war that almost wipes out humanity. Greatly affected by the loss of everyone she knows, she helps to craft a new society where everyone is detached from one another. This odd system ends up much more problematic than Miriam intended. The story of Miriam trying to fight back against her own society is riveting and reflective of the modern society we have today.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-in-the-garden-of-iden" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/5txUU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">3. <em>In the Garden of Iden</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">The first book in this series from <a href="https://geni.us/5txUU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Kage Baker</a> is deceptive in its setting, taking place mostly in the 16th century. However, this hides its sci-fi premise, which revolves around a 24th century corporation that finally invents time travel. The catch is it’s a one-way trip back into the past for time travelers, which leads to the invention of immortal cyborgs. These cyborgs recruit other ill-fated children to become immortal, leading to a dark, deep, and often engrossing tale. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-hellspark" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/7Wip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">2. <em>Hellspark</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/7Wip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hellspark</a></em> is equal parts science fiction and riveting murder mystery. Lassti is a new planet with a race of birdlike humanoids. But when someone kills one of the key survey team members, it is up to a trader in the wrong place at the wrong time to solve the mystery. There are many layers to the core murder whodunnit and the protagonist’s often goofy mannerisms help to liven the otherwise intense story.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-moderan" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/x5kZQZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">1. <em>Moderan</em></a></h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/x5kZQZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Moderan</a></em> from author David R. Bunch is the progenitor of many cyberpunk and sci-fi novels today, but it remains somewhat obscure in the genre. The 1971 novel revolves around the titular city of Moderan and various short stories throughout it. The wars between the cyborgs and their fortresses feel reminiscent of modern society, leading to some excellent storytelling and introspection. </p>

These require a Regular or Ominous Trial Key to open, which are acquired from Regular or Ominous Trial Spawners. With that out of the way, here are all drops and their chance to drop:</p>

 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false">It’s worth noting that while some of these percentage chances can be quite low, each Regular and Ominous Vault will drop <strong>three to six sets of loot</strong>. This is where the Nothing item comes in, as its chance proccing means you’ll receive nothing for that set. If you proc that three times in a row, you’ll only receive three sets of loot. The loot drop can not be Nothing on the first three sets of loot.</p>
