Its release sparked a player surge as fans flocked to test out the new subclasses as well as the brand new photo mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Baldur’s Gate 3 hit a player concurrent peak of 169,267 over the weekend — an incredible feat for a single-player focused role-playing game in its second year. Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation nor Xbox player numbers publicly available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the release of Patch 8, Larian chief Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1914637297946931379" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say he expects Baldur’s Gate 3 to “continue to do well for quite some time,” not just because of the Patch 8 player boost, but because of “thriving” mod support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This in turn gives Larian “room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can,” Vincke continued. “We’ve got big shoes to fill.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Feeling good today about where we are with BG3," Vincke said. "Patch 8 got a lot of people playing again. It took a lot of development effort but I'm happy we did it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With mod support thriving, I think the game will now continue to do well for quite some time. It gives us room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can and that focus is more than welcome. We've got big shoes to fill."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, as Larian has signalled, is the final major update for the game and draws a line under what has been a remarkable time for the developer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 launched to critical acclaim</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed"><u>enormous commercial success</u></a> back in 2023, and has continued to sell strongly throughout 2024 and into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian shocked the gaming world by confirming its intention to leave Baldur’s Gate 3 and Dungeons &amp; Dragons behind to work on a brand new game, which it teased at various points before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable"><u>announcing a media blackout to focus on the new mystery project</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">D&amp;D owner Hasbro, however, has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says"><u>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," Ayoub said. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/21/paul-rudd-returns-in-nintendo-switch-2-ad-34-years-after-his-famous-snes-commercial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In 1991, Nintendo featured an unknown actor named Paul Rudd in its United States launch commercial for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Fast forward to 2025, and Paul Rudd is more than 30 years deep into an acting career that has seen him star in films like <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>, <em>I Love You, Man</em>, and the Ant-Man franchise, as well as fight with Captain America and Iron Man in blockbusters like <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. To pay homage to the now-famous actor’s early work as just a guy who’s Playing with Power, Nintendo brought the movie star back in the first US commercial for Switch 2.</p>

<p><span><span>This commercial's release coincides with the announcement of the United States preorder date, which was initially scheduled for April 9. However, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">tumult surrounding President Trump's tariffs on foreign goods</a> delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in both the United States and Canada. Last week, Nintendo revealed the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0dea30b2-7e9b-43f4-a82e-9a35679b42ca" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">new United States preorder date as April 24</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can see the new Switch 2 commercial starring Paul Rudd below.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uGXvdbL1ys" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>The ad, which emphasizes the Switch 2's online multiplayer and GameChat social features, plays with the SNES's "Now You’re Playing with Power" tagline. Instead, it uses the line, "Now You’re Playing Together." To provide the context to its YouTube subscribers, Nintendo also uploaded the original 1991 SNES ad featuring Paul Rudd, which you can see below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System arrived on US shelves on August 23, 1991. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5, 2025, with the delayed preorders finally starting this Thursday, April 24.

Following <a href="https://gameinformer.com/node/123750">last week's leak</a>, in which screenshots surfaced, Bethesda's official social media accounts shared an image teasing an announcement tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bethesda took to its accounts on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter to share an image with the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion font with only "IV" displayed and an armored mask in the background. The tweet says, "Tomorrow, 11:00 am EST" and lists URLs to the Bethesda Twitch and YouTube channels. When you visit the YouTube channel, you are greeted by the same art, with a livestream that has the title, "All will be revealed...."</p>

</article><p>The screenshots that hit the Oblivion subreddit last week, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" target="_blank">users started digging into the website files of game development studio Virtuos</a>, potentially indicating that the studio is responsible for the remaster. Immediately following the widely publicized leak, the studio's website was taken offline. Virtuos is a Singapore-based development studio that typically runs support for larger studios or ports the works of other studios to new platforms. Most recently, Virtuos has been assisting Konami with developing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the upcoming remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.</p>

<p>We don't know the platforms or release date of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, but widespread speculation is that it will release very soon on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, we will not know for sure until tomorrow when the livestream occurs at 11 am Eastern / 8 am Pacific. To watch it live, you can head to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

			<p>A few months later than expected, Sony shared an official PlayStation 5 Pro teardown to provide a better look at the system's cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The teardown covers pretty much every aspect of the system, starting with its design that sets it apart from the original PS5 model and its slimmer revision featuring a "louver" sitting between the main unit and the cover, which makes the console quieter. The rear design has also been changed for more efficient airflow over the other PS5 models.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's official teardown obviously also provides a great look at the system's internals, which highlights the new fan designed to generate airflow more efficiently, which features the same number of blades of the regular PS5 fan, the strategically placed high number of screws to reduce electromagnetic interference, the large motherboard made of more internal layers than the base PS5's motherboard to achieve faster memory performance, the added DDR5 memory chip, and the innovative use of liquid metal, whose usage in the base PS5 proved to be the right choice, as liquid metal technology was integral when designing the PS5 Pro. All of this, and more, can be found explained in greater detail on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/21/playstation-5-pro-teardown-an-inside-look-at-the-most-advanced-playstation-console-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launched worldwide in November. It is currently the most powerful system on the market, allowing for advanced visual features not available on other systems, as seen in the recently released<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-resolution-new-comparison-highlights-how-xbox-series-x-closer-ps5-pro/"> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/653115/nvidia-gpu-drivers-black-screen-crashes-issues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s GPU drivers have been a disaster over the past four months. It all started when Nvidia released its drivers for the RTX 50-series cards in January, and introduced black screen issues, game crashes, and general stability problems for new and existing graphics cards. Now, yet another new hotfix has emerged to fix even more issues introduced by Nvidia’s buggy drivers.</p><p>Nvidia GPU owners have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">struggling for months</a> with a variety of issues reported on Reddit and in Nvidia’s own support forums, with most people fixing their issues by rolling back to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fdrivers%2Fdetails%2F237719%2F" rel="sponsored">December 566.36 driver</a> before the RTX 50-series. Those fortunate enough to secure one of Nvidia’s latest GPUs aren’t able to roll back to the old drivers as they simply don’t support the new RTX 50-series, so Nvidia has been issuing a series of updates to try and address the problems.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready">The 576.02 driver release last week</a>, which included lots of bug and crash fixes, seemed like it would finally solve the issues that have plagued Nvidia’s driver releases over the past few months, but it has made things worse for some. Posters in the Nvidia forums have been reporting issues with GPU monitoring utilities not reporting the correct GPU temperatures since installing 576.02, so Nvidia was forced to release a hotfix driver yesterday to address this issue.</p><p>The latest <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5650/~/geforce-hotfix-display-driver-version-576.15">576.15 hotfix</a> also includes fixes for lower idle GPU clock speeds for RTX 50-series owners, and some fixes for certain games flickering after updating to last week’s 576.02 driver. I would highly recommend installing this hotfix driver if you’re on an RTX 50-series GPU or you regularly set your PC to sleep mode and use GPU monitoring utilities like Afterburner to control a custom fan curve based on GPU temperatures.</p><p>While this latest hotfix driver addresses some important issues, Nvidia forum posters are <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F563719%2Fannouncing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57615-released-42%2F" rel="sponsored">still reporting</a> lots of game crashes, performance issues, and stuttering when using G-Sync in certain games. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F563010%2Fgeforce-grd-57602-feedback-thread-released-41625%2F" rel="sponsored">Nvidia is currently tracking</a> at least 15 open issues with its 576.02 driver that will hopefully be addressed with the next official driver release.</p><p>Nvidia has released four hotfix drivers over the past two months, which is a surprising amount of hotfixes between the main Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) releases. It’s also surprising because, for the most part, Nvidia’s GPU drivers have always been stable and better than the AMD and Intel competition at game compatibility, performance, and crash-free gaming.</p><p>Nvidia’s driver issues come after a turbulent launch of the RTX 50-series cards. Some RTX 5090 power cables <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">have been melting</a>, Nvidia had to admit that some of its new GPUs had a “rare” manufacturing issue that meant they were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">missing render units</a>, and some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia’s marketing claims have been questionable</a>. The RTX 50-series cards have also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch">difficult to find in stock</a> at retail prices, leaving many PC gamers frustrated by Nvidia’s latest GPU launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Dinosaurs are cloned, genetically engineered to be better entertainment attractions, and hunted for sport. But absurdity aside, a few of those films have some surprisingly gruesome deaths, especially for a franchise aimed at family audiences.</p><p>An Indominus Rex casually flings a soldier into a tree before ripping through the rest in <em>Jurassic World. </em>A raptor pounces from the shadows to end Dieter Stark’s (Peter Stormare) creepy demise in <em>The Lost World</em>. And who could forget Zara Young’s (Katie McGrath) wildly over-the-top air-and-sea takedown by Pteranodons and a Mosasaurus—still the franchise’s most elaborate (and strangely beautiful) execution. With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em></a></span> ushering in a new era of dino disasters on July 2, let’s see which of its predecessors captured the imagination and snatched our breaths away best with its deaths.</p></div></div><div><p>No <em>Jurassic Park</em> or <em>World </em>movie takes a bigger nosedive in quality purely because of how absurd its death scenes are than <em>Fallen Kingdom</em>. This is the movie where a random mercenary gets his arm chomped off by a tranquilized raptor because he casually walks into its cage—as if he forgot he was in a dinosaur movie and not working security at a mall. Then there’s the rich auction guest who stands motionless under a cage as the Indoraptor lines up the kill like it’s posing for a horror movie poster. And let’s not forget the rooftop scene where the Indoraptor literally stalks a child like Dracula before impaling itself on decorative horns. These aren’t just far-fetched deaths—they’re cartoonishly choreographed in a way that makes it hard to take any of them seriously. It’s like the writers asked, “What’s the dumbest way someone could die?” and then made it canon.</p></div><div><p><em>Jurassic Park III</em> isn’t the worst movie in the franchise, but it’s hanging onto second-to-last by the claws of a raptor—and even those feel a little dulled here. The deaths just don’t hit as hard. Sure, there’s a moment or two worth replaying, like the Spinosaurus tearing through a plane crash like it’s made of tinfoil and then slamming its teeth into M.B. Nash (Bruce A. Young) mid-sprint. And the raptor snapping Udesky’s (Michael Jeter) neck after using his screams to lure the others to its trap was terrifyingly cool, and a chilling introduction of the dinosaur’s enhanced strategic intelligence. But when you stack it against the rest of the franchise, where people get ripped in half, stomped into the dirt, or juggled mid-air like chew toys before being swallowed by sea monsters, this one feels tame. It flirts with the chaos, but never commits to the carnage—and in a franchise famous for spectacular deaths, that just doesn’t cut it.</p></div><div><p>Few <em>Jurassic</em> movies waste their potential quite like <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>. It’s not that it lacks dino action—on the contrary, the Therizinosaurus vs. Giganotosaurus showdown is an apex predator brawl worthy of the franchise’s legacy, and the locust swarm burning across farmland like biblical vengeance is straight-up haunting. But when it comes to the franchise’s trademark death scenes? <em>Dominion </em>blinks. Characters are snatched, mauled, or incinerated—and yet somehow, we’re usually watching it from behind a tree or right as the camera cuts away. In a series that once let a raptor tear into Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) offscreen because it was the ‘90s, it’s wild that a 2022 blockbuster felt the need to censor itself. For all its scale and spectacle, <em>Dominion</em> ends up in the bottom half of the franchise rankings simply because it forgot what made the chaos so thrilling in the first place: letting us watch.</p></div><div><p>If there’s one <em>Jurassic</em> sequel that leans into the brutality, it’s <em>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</em>. Eddie Carr’s (Richard Schiff) death is both gruesome and gutting—after heroically holding the trailer in place to save Ian and Sarah from falling, he’s yanked from his SUV by two T-Rexes and torn in half like a rag doll. Dieter Stark’s is slower but no less disturbing—separated from the group, he’s stalked through the jungle by Compies that chip away at him bite by bite until his screams fade into silence. Also, poor Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) gets dragged into the juvenile Rex pen by the adult and left to be mauled, whimpering, by the baby in what feels more like a training session than a kill. Where other films glance away from the gore, <em>The Lost World</em> stares straight at it, making every death feel earned, brutal, and unforgettable.</p></div><div><p>Look, no <em>Jurassic Park/World</em> film’s ranking on this list is as dependent on the majesty of one death as <em>Jurassic World</em>.  But, there was no one death in this movie (and arguably any other movie from the franchise) than the choreography of Zara being tossed around in mid-air by two Pteranodons, dropped into the sea where another Pteranodon dives in to snatch her up (THEY CAN SWIM TOO?!) before a fucking sea-dwelling Mosasaurus emerges from the sea to swallow them both whole in a gorgeously executed example of the cycle of life. The fact all of that happened in less than 40 seconds is a testament how much gruesome detail you can pack into a scene when you don’t cut away from the mayhem. </p></div><div><p>Compared to the glossy CGI bloodbaths that would follow in future <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World </em>films, the OG that started all looks almost prehistoric, and that’s what makes it the most gruesome. Without advanced special effects producing swarms of Pteranodons and Quetzalcoatluses or toothy battles between gigantic T-Rexes, Steven Spielberg relied on giving us an unflinching look at the struggle to live. A man being snatched off the toilet and into the jaws of death feels more visceral than one computer generated dinosaur gorging on another. The stakes feel more real. Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck) stealthily being outsmarted by a Velociraptor in the jungle, before conceding the she’s a “clever girl” as his final words, might be the most iconic death in <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World</em> history. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ill-never-get-over-the-original-jurassic-park-1710713069&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ill-never-get-over-the-original-jurassic-park-1710713069"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a></span>’s case, less is more: human suspense will always trump CGI theatrics when it comes to blood and gore. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-challenge-ciri-important-geralt/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The biggest challenge The Witcher IV will face is convincing players that Ciri is just as important as the iconic Geralt of Rivia, if not even more, and to present this fact convincingly, according to the game's Cinematic Animation Director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@G4G_Revenant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenant</a>, David Cordero, who also worked as the Cinematic Animation Director for Cyberpunk 2077, commented on the challenges the next entry in the series will face coming after one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time, saying that the biggest will be convincing players that Ciri is just as important as Geralt, if not even more. This, according to Cordero, will be the hardest part, as Geralt is a really charismatic character that has already appeared in multiple games, whereas Ciri has only appeared in The Witcher 3. The rest, on the other hand, is not going to be difficult, as the studio is going all in for gameplay and combat, and is constantly listening to players' feedback.</p>
<p>To present Ciri in the proper way in The Witcher IV, the development team is leveraging the lore department that was formed during the development of the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty expansion, and will focus on showing what's actually happening and not just on showing why Ciri is a proper witcher. The lore department will also make sure that every little detail fits properly into the game's world.</p>
<p>Speaking about the narrative elements in The Witcher IV, CDPR's Cinematic Animation Director revealed that Cyberpunk 2077 will be a point of reference for the game, as CDPR did some outstanding work on the first-person open-world RPG that has, in many ways, surpassed what was done in The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="Downgrade #11 CD Projekt | Dev Español cuenta cómo se hizo Cyberpunk y el futuro de The Witcher 4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlelBwxBax8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Being as much a The Witcher nerd as those in CDPR's lore department, I can only concur with David Cordero's statement, as Ciri plays an extremely important role in the books written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The best thing about the novels, however, is how Ciri's importance is balanced with Geralt and Yennefer's importance, so hopefully, the development team will be able to strike a similar balance in their highly anticipated game that is not launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">until 2027</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us season two is under way, and this weekend we were treated to the second episode. 'Treated' is, perhaps, the wrong word to use here. After all, there were some pretty major story beats in this episode, and well, you know voices on the internet have opinions on what happened.</p>

<p>We knew it was coming, but it happened perhaps sooner than many of us expected. In the second episode of The Last of Us season two, Joel is killed by Abby.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no bad blood at all between Pedro Pascal and Kaitlyn Dever, who play Joel and Abby on the show. Soon after the episode aired, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIsnfw9uzpL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Pascal shared a heartwarming picture of the two on set</a>, captioning the image: "Thank you, scene partner.

<p>But, while Pascal and Dever are smiling in the photo, there is no denying that the moment of Joel's death was tough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-actor-pedro-pascal-discusses-the-last-of-us-season-twos-most-shocking-moment-yet">for the cast and viewers</a>. Perhaps it was harder for those coming to the show without any prior knowledge of the source material. This user seems to think so.</p>

<p>Some have said they will <a href="https://x.com/B3ARZATTO/status/1914157825669976290/photo/1">never emotionally recover from seeing Ellie lying next to Joel's dead body</a> at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>"Ellie crawling to Joel’s body and cuddling up next to it.. that was way worse than the game," <a href="https://x.com/giannaispunk/status/1914137102511415581">wrote one viewer</a>.</p>
<p>"Does it ever keep y'all up at night knowing how Joel was ready to end it all? to accept his fate in death, until he heard Ellie yelling for him to get up? What little energy he had left was used in trying to push himself to live for her," <a href="https://x.com/pascalfanatic/status/1914528859787039152">another viewer wrote</a>, referring to the way Joel lifted his fingers while lying on the ground in a beaten bloody mess.</p>
<p>"THE WAY HIS FINGERS TWITCH. HE WANTED TO REACH OUT TO HER. OH MY GOD," <a href="https://x.com/lcvespascal/status/1914161545593983060">reads yet another post</a>.</p>
<p>Here's another user so upset by the whole ordeal that full caps lock was the only way to write. "ELLIE LAYING ON TOP OF JOELS BODY WAS THE MOST FOUL THING I’VE EVER SEEN," <a href="https://x.com/xkimberlynx/status/1914136143781671400">they wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Some viewers have just decided to go into denial, and as far as they are concerned Joel is absolutely fine, thank you very much.</p><p>

"I'm still convinced Joel'ss death scene was a mass hallucination like no that actually did not happen," <a href="https://x.com/dayasrussell/status/1914330722610864196">wrote one hopeful viewer</a>.

<p>I think <a href="https://x.com/wizardjarin/status/1914266574346658117">this user</a> has summed things up quite well for all of us watching The Last of Us season two. They captioned an image of Pascal bobbing about in the ocean while on holiday as this: "New photo of Pedro Pascal swimming in our tears."</p>
<p>Agree, we have probably all cried an ocean's worth since episode two aired earlier this week. At least he's still alive to look after Grogu in The Mandalorian, I suppose…</p>

<p>On the plus side, though, at least Joel knew he was handsome before he was beaten to a pulp. Abby said it both this episode and the first episode.</p>

            <p>
A developer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a> has commented on recent research that pitted various AI models against the classic courtroom series' first installment.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ace-attorney-dev-reacts-to-the-game-being-used-to-test-how-smart-ai-models-are-maybe-this-kind-of-deductive-power-is-the-strength-of-humans/">Automaton</a>, Hao AI Lab used Ace Attorney to try and benchmark four AI models' memory, reasoning skills, visual understanding and strategic decision-making - with some performing better than others.
</p>
<p>
While none of the AI models managed to beat the game, Google Gemini and Open AI's o1 managed to reason their way through to its penultimate episode.
</p>
<p>
"This index uses Ace Attorney to evaluate the AI's practical ability to 'find inconsistencies in testimony, select appropriate evidence to support them, and refute them most effectively'," AI researcher K Ishi <a href="https://x.com/K_Ishi_AI/status/1912330532274483213">wrote</a>. "As a result, the best 'lawyer' was o1."
</p>
<p>
The research was designed to test each AI's ability to consider "the entire flow of the case and make decisions without being limited to current testimony", Ishi added, as well as having the "ability to consider the timing of 'meaningful' situations and create the most effective strategy". 
</p>
<p>
Each AI's understanding would also have to remain flexible enough to react to fresh evidence coming to light mid-trial, he continued. You can watch each of the four AI models tested play the game via the video in the embed below.

"How should I put this, I never thought the game I worked on so desperately 25 years ago would come to be used in this way, and overseas at that (laughs)," <a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1913719762762477685">wrote Ace Attorney developer Masakazu Sugimori</a>, who composed the game's soundtrack and voiced antagonist Manfred von Karma.
</p>
<p>
"I find it interesting how the AI models get stumped in the first episode," Sugimori continued, in response to seeing the research. "[Ace Attorney director Shu] Takumi and [executive producer Shinji] Mikami were very particular about the difficulty level of Episode 1 - it's supposed to be simple for a human. Maybe this kind of deductive power is the strength of humans?"
</p>
<p>
"The reason why Takumi and Mikami were so particular about balancing the difficulty level of Ace Attorney's first episode was because 'there was no other game like it in the world at the time'," Sugimori added. 
</p>
<p>
"It had to be a difficulty that would be acceptable to a wide playerbase, but it had to avoid being insultingly simple too. They were going for the kind of difficulty that gives you a sense of satisfaction when the solution hits you."
</p>
<p>
And as far as we know, no AI has been programmed to feel that same sense of satisfaction - yet. Come back in five years, though, and it'll be interesting to see whether the AI models of 2030 can beat the game.
</p>

            <p>The maker of cryptic block-seeding puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseed-pilgrim">Starseed Pilgrim</a> has announced a new game in which you are invited to do the unspeakable and "kill gameplay". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-end-of-gameplay">The End Of Gameplay</a> will be an exploratory 2D platformer according to the tags on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3120040/The_End_of_Gameplay/">Steam page</a> but anyone who has played the work of creator Droqen might predict those labels to prove looser than a toddler's shoelace. Enjoyers of obscure and poetic wanderings in minimalist spaces will probably be happy with the trailer below.</p>

<p>The creator describes it as "like Starseed Pilgrim, but only all the parts that nobody told me they cared about". This is a strong pitch but in what direction I cannot tell. Starseed Pilgrim was a mysterious blockbuilding platformer released back in the hellsands of 2013, in which you had to plant various seeds and discover their effects to go... somewhere? I never quite got it, to be honest. But that's okay, I'm not alone.</p>
<p>"I think of Starseed Pilgrim as a game that is enjoyed, mostly, by indie game devs, and this new game is even more down that rabbithole," said Droqen in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/230980/view/506200344140710456">announcement post on Steam</a>. "You can tell from the title, it is about gameplay, it is something. If you want to kill gameplay too or you just want to bathe in the blood of its ending or you just want to watch in horror, maybe this game of a poem will be for you." </p>
<p>We at RPS regularly and viciously kill the <em>word</em> "gameplay" every time it appears, like a relentless weed in our garden of text (I am strongly restraining myself right now). But that's just a word, the visible tuft of a greater problem. The <em>concept</em> of gameplay remains stubborn, its roots spreading deep under the soil of the games industry like a vast and undefinable mycorrhizal network. It is this which Droqen seeks to destroy. This mission is a dangerous folly. I am interested to see how it goes. </p>
<p>"I wanted to release it to as few people as possible," said the dev about the new game, "but then I did that, and then I showed it to a few more people, and then a few more, and I started yelling <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=from%3Adroqen.bsky.social+%22kill+gameplay%22">'kill gameplay'</a> on Bluesky. It got away from me..."</p>
<p>Sounds like one for Edwin, our resident ludopoet. It's also described as an anthology, continuing a long-running trend of indie creators shoving their short works into one compact package. Terry Cavanagh did this recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creator-of-dicey-dungeons-vvvvvv-and-super-hexagon-launches-a-big-freeware-collection">Terry's Other Games</a> and long ago Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thecatamites-commercial-collection-50-short-games">50 Short Games</a>. Then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, the combined effort of multiple developers. </p>
<p>While Starseed Pilgrim didn't do it for me, it was admired by Adam (RPS in peace) who was at a loss to describe the seed 'em up's appeal in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-starseed-pilgrim">his review</a>. "What to say about a game that would be better passed from hand to hand at bizarre conventions, residing on an unmarked disc with no readme.txt and no explanation?" he said. "I’d gladly forbid people from trying to explain what they’ve experienced to newcomers because the joy is in the discoveries."</p>
<p>The End Of Gameplay will be released on "the full flower moon in May". That's May 12th according to my googling of witchy moon phases. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"In a world of dragons and magic, you must always be ready for battle. Take advantage of the terrain and the weapon in your hand, and attack enemies either from afar using magic or up close with your sword. Each weapon has its own strength and weakness, so choose wisely when attacking your opponent, because you don't want to be caught off guard," reads the trailer's official blurb.</p>

			<p>NEXON has shared several updates on their upcoming co-op action RPG Vindictus: Defying Fate. <a href="https://wccftech.com/vindictus-defying-fate-is-a-new-upcoming-action-rpg-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in February 2024, the game is based on the fantasy IP of the popular free-to-play MMORPG. Following last year's Pre-Alpha Test, the developers have now scheduled a PC (Steam) Alpha Test for June. They have also shared the content that will be available for testing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>4 playable characters</li>
<li>Companion system: NPC companions that assist in combat</li>
<li>Combat: Single-player or multiplayer, depending on the content</li>
<li>Story and cutscenes: Includes Alpha Test version NPCs and story-related cutscenes</li>
<li>Growth system: Leveling, weapon crafting, Ability system, and more</li>
<li>Village and inventory system</li>
<li>Select cosmetic items</li>
<li>And more diverse content will also be available during the test</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>NEXON also talked about some of the improvements made to Vindictus: Defying Fate following the Pre-Alpha feedback. Characters will now be able to climb ladders and ride ziplines to reach certain places, as well as use grappling hooks to navigate the environment more quickly. Traps have also been introduced to make the experience more engaging.</p>
<p>Of course, combat remains the core aspect of the game. NEXON has added a so-called Special Action that can only be executed with precise timing. When performed successfully, it either triggers a Perfect Guard, blocking the attack entirely, or a Perfect Dodge, which flows into a powerful counterattack, depending on the character picked.</p>
<p>When a foe is staggered, players can execute a Fatal Action. This works by attacking the enemy, building up a stagger gauge. When that gauge is full, the enemy loses its stance for a brief moment, allowing players the opportunity to perform the Fatal Action and take it down. All the&nbsp;playable characters in the upcoming Alpha Test (Lann, Fiona, Karok, and Delia) will be equipped with a unique Fatal Action that is tailor-made for their combat style.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, NEXON released a new character trailer for Delia. You can watch it embedded right above. Vindictus: Defying Fate doesn't have a release date yet; it will launch on PC as well as consoles, although the console version may come out at a later date.</p>

            <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, has shared his thoughts on the shocking events from this week's episode.</p>
<p><strong>Please note, there will be major spoilers for The Last of Us below. </strong></p>

<figcaption>Eurogamer: The death of consoles is inevitable and I don't know how I feel about it.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipoW24t90fw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During the early hours of Monday morning for those of us here in the UK, the second episode of The Last of Us season two aired. It was a packed showing, with more infected than you can shake a stick at. But, even though the siege of Jackson was surely an suspenseful and emotionally impactful story beat, there is one moment in particular that has grabbed the hearts of viewers and torn them  into a million pieces - Joel's death.</p>
<p>As in The Last of Us Part 2, in the show Joel is killed with a golf club by Abby, a former Firefly seeking revenge for the death of her father.</p>
<p>In the season one finale,  Joel massacred the Fireflies in Salt Lake City in a bid to save Ellie, his surrogate daughter. And now, the time has come for him to face the consequences of those actions. Abby - played in the show by Kaitlyn Dever - arrives in Jackson with a group of fellow former Fireflies to even the score. And she does, beating Joel until finally dealing a killing strike to the neck with a golf club. It's a hard watch.</p>
<p>But, what is it like for Pascal and the rest of The Last of Us' cast and crew? "I'm in active denial," <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-shocker-kaitlyn-dever-bella-ramsey-on-set-exclusive-11717893">Pascal told EW</a>, following the episode's debut.</p>
<p>"I realise this more and more as I get older, I find myself slipping into denial that anything is over. I know that I'm forever bonded to so many members of the experience and just have to see them under different circumstances, but never will under the circumstances of playing Joel on The Last of Us.</p>
<p>"And, no, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it because it makes me sad."</p>
<p>But while it may make the actor sad, Pascal believes the fact that this narrative has affected and pained so many people is a "brilliant achievement of the storytelling".</p>
<p>"I have nothing but respect for the level of investment that people have in a video game or a TV show or movie or book. I experience that myself. I've flung books across the room because its impact is so profound on me and experiencing the story," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-joel-death-last-of-us-1236373640/">Pascal said</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The show has made a few tweaks to The Last of Us Part 2's narrative - for example having Dina on patrol with Joel that day, rather than his brother Tommy. Another change made by the showrunners was to have Bella Ramsey's Ellie drag herself over to Joel's dead body, an image that will stay with me for a long time to come. According to showrunner Craig Mazin, this moment was "in there from the very beginning, draft one". This is because Ellie at this moment also believes she is going to die.</p>
<p>"Ellie's been kicked in the ribs. She's clearly very injured. She has no reason to think she's going to survive," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-joel-dies-pedro-pascal-1236372785/">Mazin told Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"She's not crawling over there just to say goodbye. She's crawling over there so she could be with him in death. That's where she wants to be, and it's when she takes his hand. We've seen her do it before. Bella Ramsey, geez."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/promise-mascot-agency-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>How far will you go to help your family? Would you lend them some money? Help them to build a business to secure their future? Get exiled to a cursed town to turnaround a failing business while slowly dying? If you chose the last option, then you may have to check you have not transformed into Michi, the main character of weird and thoroughly charming Promise Mascot Agency.</p>
<p><iframe title="Promise Mascot Agency | Launch Trailer | Available Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEnZ9rafWng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Promise Mascot Agency is the latest from Kaizen Game Works, taking you to the deprived Japanese town of Kaso Machi, which is far from its heyday due to lack of investment and a corrupt mayor. Michi is sent here after a deal goes wrong and is tasked with restarting his family’s mascot agency which, as it turns out, has zero mascots. All that is available to him is a rundown love hotel and its manager Pinky, a giant finger mascot. Before we go on, you need to know that in this world mascots are not people in costumes, but actual people in their own right. So yes, your sidekick is a giant finger, and she is easily the best supporting character of 2025 so far. Pinky will pick you up when your down, call you out when you’re stupid, and plan the deaths of your enemies with glee. A real ride or die kind of finger, is our Pinky.</p>


<p>Despite all her strengths, Pinky is not a good mascot for events, but she knows where to find some. Kaso Machi is filled with out of work mascots who need jobs, and you need their expertise.</p>


<p>One of the highlights of Promise Mascot Agency is how the agency’s success ties in with the growth of Kaso Machi and helping the mascots realise their own dreams. When you first start out the town barely has any events going on that require a mascot, but as you make money you can reinvest into Kaso Machi to encourage more businesses to open, offering more opportunities for your mascots to work. Mascots won’t just come to you for nothing though. When you recruit a mascot, you’ll put together an offer for them to accept or decline, including providing time off, wage increases, and bonuses.</p>
<p>The core aspect of the game is to run the agency, and a lot of it you can do from the management menu. You will be notified of jobs mascots can take, be told when a mascot is taking time off, and get alerted to when a mascot needs help on a job. Mascots have a lot of dangers to face in their profession from ranging from small doors, to misshapen steps, exploding machines, and the vengeful spirits of the dead. If any of these threats appear, and the mascots cannot deal with them alone, you will be called in to help using Mascot Support Heroes.</p>

<p>Mascot Support Heroes are cards you can collect from around Kaso Machi, some being town residents that you help and others being cards you find while out exploring. Each card has its own stats, but the most important is attack power. The enemies of mascots have life bars and these need to be whittled away using the Mascot Support Heroes cards. It is a very simple minigame and much of the time you will get through with no issue.</p>
<p>Kaso Machi is a great location to explore while driving around in your little truck with Pinky as a guide. Many of the activities are based around collecting things or smashing things, though you can also clean shrines for benefits. Kaso Machi is a mess and there are rubbish bags everywhere, but with a truck upgrade you’ll be able to clean up the rubbish and be rewarded while doing so. Kaso Machi is a strange place though and one of the other things you can destroy are floating sins. These are floating ghostly white trails that you can try to drive into or launch Pinky into them when you get the launcher upgrade. If you want to really anger the mayor (and you do) you can go around destroying all his signs.</p>

<p>The people of Kaso Machi will have tasks for you too and these are usually to collect things for them. Collectathons can go wrong and become repetitive, but Promise Mascot Agency makes it simple as the items are marked on the map as white dots. Some are more accessible than others, but when you unlock the gilder and boat upgrades for your truck you’ll floating through the air or on the waves to reach those collectables.</p>
<p>Promise Mascot Agency’s story is one of family ties, positive reinforcement, and pushing back against the odds as outside dangers close in. It is an over-the-top plot, but it has so much heart and so many memorable characters that you will be rooting for them. Michi and Pinky are a great comedic duo with Michi acting as the serious one to Pinky’s unfiltered thoughts. They are joined by 20 mascots that all have their own stories, motivations, and goals and with your help and support they can reach their real potentials. There’s a lot of heart and the story, the characters, and the setting all tie in together to create a world that is engaging to explore and immerse yourself in.</p>

            <p>
Bethesda will finally show off its long-awaited The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake today.
</p>
<p>
Teaser imagery can now be seen on Bethesda's social media channels pointing to today's date, 22nd April, and a time: 4pm UK. (That's 11am Eastern or 8am Pacific if you live across the pond.)
</p>
<p>
Bethesda then links to its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube pages, directing you to watch the game's announcement trailer when it drops. But when will the game itself be available?
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer previously reported</a>, amidst a sea of leaks, Bethesda has been planning to announce and shadow drop the game this week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass.

<p>
Bethesda's Oblivion Remaster has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">one of gaming's worst kept secrets over recent months</a>, with screenshots popping up in the files of developer Virtuos' website this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">references to the game on Bethesda's own site</a> just days ago.

<p>
That's not to mention the years of references to the project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">spotted in Microsoft documents</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">whispered by a former developer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over the long weekend, the leaks continued. Fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3tvxy/oblivion_remake_steamdb_listing_leaked/">spotted a SteamDB listing</a> for the game, while others claimed it had suddenly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3sclu/oblivion_remastered_appearing_on_steam_accounts/">turned up in their Steam accounts</a>. Others noticed that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k4b068/esrb_oblivion_entry_last_updated_50_minutes_ago/">US ratings board listing had suddenly been updated</a> too.
</p>
<p>
The Oblivion Remake is expected to be a new version of Bethesda's classic Elder Scrolls game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by port studio Virtuos.
</p>
<p>
According to an earlier leak by a ex-Virtuos developer, the game will feature newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery and hit reaction systems, as well as a fresh HUD.
</p>
<p>
How will it feel to play? Well, here's <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/">Virtuos design director Nicolas Roginski speaking in March 2024 to 80.lv</a> seemingly about the project, without actually naming what it is.
</p>
<p>
"We are working on a very big, unannounced project," Roginski said. "Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It's challenging, mainly because of players' perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. 
</p>
<p>
"Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won't match the 'feeling' of their memories.
</p>
<p>
"To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the 'feeling of the memory', not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is 'Keep, Improve, Create'."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to "remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed. Tune in at 4pm today to see Jim be disappointed, I guess.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remaster-developer-shares-design-philosophy-recreating-the-feeling-of-the-memory/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remaster-developer-shares-design-philosophy-recreating-the-%E2%80%98feeling-of-the-memory%E2%80%99.1170000/</guid>

			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frantic few weeks of rumors</a>, the announcement day for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remaster has arrived. Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a dedicated stream will air today on Twitch and YouTube starting at 11 AM Eastern Time/8 AM Pacific Time/4 PM British Time.</p>
<p>According to rumors, the game should be shadowdropped, meaning that it should also be released right after the stream. Meanwhile, we have uncovered some details about the developer's design philosophy for this project. Bethesda picked Singaporean game developer Virtuos to aid them in this remaster. The studio previously worked on the Nintendo Switch port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NieR Automata: End of Yorha Edition</a> and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition</a>, while also collaborating on major triple-A projects like Hogwarts Legacy, Dead Island 2, Horizon Forbidden West - Complete Edition, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>Last year, game development website 80Lv <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Virtuos specifically about their work on remasters and ports. During the interview, Design Director Nicolas Roginski shared a reply that, in hindsight, cannot have been referencing anything other than the Oblivion Remaster:</p>
<p><em>We are working on a very big, unannounced project. Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It’s challenging, mainly because of players’ perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won’t match the “feeling” of their memories.</em></p>
<p><em>To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the “feeling of the memory”, not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is “Keep, Improve, Create”:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keep what is core to the original vision and core memories players have of the original game.</em></li>
<li><em>Improve what you need to modernize because standards have evolved.</em></li>
<li><em>Create in the sense of what needs to be removed or added to surprise the player, and set a new standard for the genre, which has evolved over the years</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtuos is also working alongside Konami on another very big project, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, the interview was published in March 2024, while MGS Delta: Snake Eater had been announced in May 2023 and was in fact already referenced in the 80Lv article. As such, it's almost guaranteed that Roginski had to have been referring to the Oblivion Remaster.</p>
<p>The idea of recreating the feeling of the memory is definitely the right one, at least on paper. However, executing that concept is undoubtedly harder than simply adopting it. The return of The Elder Scrolls IV is sure to induce a lot of nostalgia in a lot of people, but only a quality product can make it resurface with positive feelings.</p>
<p>We likely won't have to wait long to judge it all first-hand. Are you excited? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Days Gone was very&nbsp;<span>good-looking for an Unreal Engine 4 open-world game launched in 2019 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-q-we-were-blown-away-by-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 for PC</a>), but it's been a while, and these enhancements are undoubtedly welcome. Hopefully, alongside the new modes, they'll help shine an even greater light on this entirely underrated game. Unfortunately, Sony has&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nixed the pitch for a sequel</a> and</span>&nbsp;also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Bend's next project earlier this year. Perhaps, if Days Gone Remastered does well enough, they might reconsider the prospects of a sequel. I, for one, certainly appreciated the original game. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Days Gone puts Bend Studio once again on the map of all PlayStation gamers after many years of oblivion. While it doesn't deliver any meaningful innovations in terms of open world and gameplay mechanics, it's a fun game that sports gorgeous graphics and a surprisingly great story/cast of characters.</em></p>
<p>Days Gone Remastered will be available on Thursday, April 25.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Duolingo will soon be able to help you learn another new skill: chess.</p><p>The platform’s new chess course will use short puzzles, such as moving a knight to the correct spot to practice its L-shaped movement or checkmating a king that’s stuck in a corner, to help teach you the game. You’ll also be able to play “mini-matches” or full games against Duolingo’s Oscar character, who serves as your coach through the lessons.</p><p>Duolingo gave me a brief demo of the chess course on a recent video call, and it looks like it could be a lot of fun. The team’s approach was to “make chess as accessible as possible,” Duolingo group product manager Edwin Bodge tells <em>The Verge</em>, and the course will offer lessons for a wide range of skill levels so that people can jump in at whatever level of familiarity they already have for chess.</p><p>Chess joins topics like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253932/duolingo-loog-portable-green-piano-music-lessons">music</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/26/23319398/duolingo-math-app-beta-launch-duocon-2022">math</a> that aren’t language-based but can still be practiced via Duolingo. I asked if the company plans to build courses around other games, and staff software engineer Sammi Siegel says that “while we don’t have any plans to share right now, I think we’re just seeing how this launch goes and then we’ll go from there.”</p><p>The chess course is launching in beta testing on iOS in English, according to Monica Earle, Duolingo’s PR director. Earle estimates that in four to six weeks, more people on iOS will be able to try it, and then it will head to Android and be available in other languages down the line.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
