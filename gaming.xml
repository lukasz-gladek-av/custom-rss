		<p>The Crew Motorfest’s second year will be kicking off with two major additions to the game. The first will be the addition of Maui island to the game, which will be 100 square kilometers, adding a whole new location for players to explore. The other addition is the premium PvE called The Chase Squad.</p>

<p>Ubisoft have also given some detail about The Chase Squad, saying <em>“Maui will also be among the settings for The Chase Squad, in which players will join with an elite team of drivers who want to shake up conventional ideas about racing as they take down rival drivers. The Chase Squad will challenge players to track, outsmart, and outmaneuver racing rivals in high-speed nighttime pursuits across the islands. Season 5 will also bring more of the Made in Japan playlist, with new races, events, and locations.”</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft will be hosting a The Crew Showcase this September, where more details about Made in Japan Volume 2 and The Chase Squad will be given.</p>

Another year, another Ubisoft Forward livestream without any reference to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the long, long-awaited sci-fi sequel that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-ubisoft-insists">Ubisoft still says it has in the works</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">BGE&amp;E2 overtook Duke Nukem Forever as the game with the longest-ever development period</a>, back in 2022. 18 months later, we've heard little since. 
</p>
<p>
In January 2023, Ubisoft told Eurogamer that "Beyond Good and Evil 2's development is under way and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise."

<p>
But its development has been hit by numerous setbacks, including the departure of Ubisoft veteran Michel Ancel in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
In 2023, its developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-studio-reportedly-under-investigation-for-unprecedented-burnout-and-sick-leave">Ubisoft Montpellier was the subject of a labour investigation into "unprecedented" levels of employee stress and sickness</a>, and the departure of its managing director.
</p>
<p>
While it's been ages since we've had a proper update on the long-in-development project, fans had really hoped for some kind of update this year, after Ubisoft previously said a new version of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil would launch in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is yet to comment further on the frankly bizarre situation with its still officially unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> that some fans were able to play last year "due to a technical error".
</p>
<p>
That project was "set for early 2024", Ubisoft told Eurogamer in November last year. It's perhaps unecessary to state that it's no longer early 2024 and no longer Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th anniversary year either.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-it%E2%80%99s-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024.897417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-new-trailer-but-still-has-no-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> with a new story trailer at yesterday's Xbox Game Showcase 2024, and an Obsidian blog post briefly <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-release-date-revealed-by-obsidians-game-director-but-quickly-gets-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a November 12 release date before being corrected.</p>
<p>However, the real meat in terms of new info came today via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfEdLugnpuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest special episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which hosted Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel. She brought some new footage (though unfortunately it is only available in Full HD) and revealed plenty of new information, starting with the fact that the game will indeed feature a third-person camera option, in stark contrast to all the footage released so far. That will certainly be welcome news for all those players who can't stand first-person view due to motion sickness issues.</p>
<p>Patel also demonstrated how Obsidian aims to make it very clear for players when one of their equipped weapons is ineffective due to its lack of upgrades. Besides just not doing enough damage, you'll also get very obvious visual and sound cues that you need to gather enough resources to enhance the weapon.</p>
<p>The footage then showed some pretty nighttime (Avowed features dynamic time of day) scenes and a glimpse into the party camp, which is where the player character and their companions will rest, recuperate, and most importantly chat about what's happened.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive | Avowed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfEdLugnpuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, we got another look at the character progression. On certain level milestones, players will get to increase their attribute points: Might increases damage and carry weight, Constitution increases health and poison/bleed resistance, Dexterity improves attack and action speed, Perception increases critical hit chance and max range, Intellect augments Essence and elemental resistance, and Resolve increases stamina and reduces the cooldown of Second Wind.</p>
<p>On every level up, the character will gain one ability point to spend on skill in the Fighter, Ranger, Wizard, and Godlike trees. Avowed is classless, so you can freely choose to spend everything in the Wizard (or any other tree) or just make a jack-of-all-trades character. Some of the skills will also be helpful in traversal, such as Fan of Flames making quick work of the brambles that blocked a certain path. A respec option is available for those who may regret spending points in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Throughout the podcast, Obsidian provided a look at how to resolve a quest in two opposite ways. The player character needs to acquire the heart from an ancient forest creature, and the user can opt to slay her brethren (which will lead to a confrontation once the creature realizes you've killed them all) or use stealth to avoid the guards and obtain the item with a diplomatic approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview with Eurogamer</a>, Carrie Patel also expressed confidence in the studio's ability to release Avowed this year.</p>
<p><em>I'll say, just having come from the studio last week, the game is looking fantastic. The team is putting a lot of love into the polish. So we feel very good about 2024.</em></p>
<p>It also may be the case that Obsidian and Microsoft are waiting to see the release window of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which may be revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tomorrow</a> alongside the first look at gameplay. After all, they're both fantasy action RPGs likely headed toward a November launch.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Avowed will be available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and it'll be on Game Pass from day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has released 13 minutes of extended <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, showing off the game's updated stealth mechanics, exploration, environments, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage was released during the publisher's Ubisoft Forward event. In addition to the extended gameplay footage, Game Director Charles Benoit and Art Director Thierry Dansereau also presented a deep dive into the game's combat and stealth. "The Gameplay Walkthrough mission shown at the conference takes place in the castle town of Fukuchiyama in Tamba Province, where Naoe and Yasuke are hunting down a corrupted daimyo", the press release from Ubisoft reads. "The gameplay illustrates the complementary dynamic between the two playable heroes: Naoe,<br>
the agile and stealthy Shinobi, and Yasuke, the combat-focused Samurai."</p>
<p>Both new videos have been included below. We've also included some additional info about the gameplay walkthrough mission, as provided by Ubisoft.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Official Gameplay - Combat and Stealth Evolved | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2crLch9Mb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li>Naoe embodies the essence of a Shinobi Assassin. From a versatile grappling hook that<br>
allows for stealthy in-air assassinations and greater mobility, to kunai and her custom<br>
Hidden Blade for swift eliminations, she has access to a diverse arsenal of tools to strike<br>
from the shadows. While more vulnerable in close combat, she can skillfully deflect,<br>
dodge enemy strikes, and retaliate with lethal precision, using light, her surroundings,<br>
and structures around her to topple her foes.</li>
<li>Yasuke is tailored for direct confrontations, relying on his exceptional combat skills and<br>
mastery of Samurai weaponry. Whether wielding the Katana for decisive strikes, opting<br>
for raw power with the Kanabo, or engaging opponents from a distance with lethal flint<br>
rifle called Teppo, he can handle multiple enemies at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is slated for a release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Amazon Luna, and Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store on November 15, 2024. The game is also coming to iPad later on.</p>

  <p id="PliY6h">Ubisoft’s big games showcase, Ubisoft Forward, kept the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164106/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest</a> hype train rolling on Monday with fresh details on new and upcoming games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, and a plethora of Prince of Persia projects — including the long-awaited return (sort of) of Ubi’s <em>Sands of Time</em> remake.</p>
<p id="MoEbYa">Here’s everything that Ubisoft had to share during Ubisoft Forward 2024.</p>
<h2 id="RPObN1"><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></h2>
<div id="G0zxEV"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="rpewAR">Star Wars fans will live out their bounty hunter fantasies this summer in a brand-new open-world galactic adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175099/star-wars-outlaws-preview-impressions-stealth-gameplay"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>. At Ubisoft Forward, developers from Massive Entertainment walked players through what they can expect from scrappy scoundrel Kay Vess’ adventure. She’ll wrangle criminal cartels, engage in battles both in space and on planet Tatooine, and travel to locations familiar and new in the Star Wars galaxy. The 10-minute gameplay showcase was full of gameplay variety and plenty of blaster fire to get players hyped for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>’ Aug. 30 release date.</p>
<div id="xpUxoj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kwo41nUwyeo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zDAtw0">Not content to release just <em>one</em> new trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, Ubisoft released a second game overview trailer that highlights the title’s diversity of locations, alien species, and gameplay styles. </p>
<h2 id="BcJsPa"><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></h2>
<div id="eknQsQ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="lxI4uO">Ubisoft is taking the Assassin’s Creed series to Japan for the first time with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>. Players will be able to take on dual roles as either the stealthy shinobi Naoe or the powerhouse samurai Yasuke. At Ubisoft Forward, we got a deep dive into how those protagonists will play in a 13-minute gameplay walkthrough. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is out on Nov. 15.</p>
<h2 id="6WIGNG"><strong>Prince of Persia</strong></h2>
<p id="JZ3SLD">Ubisoft came with not one, not two, but three Prince of Persia-related announcements for the franchise’s 35th anniversary. Here’s what it showed at Ubisoft Forward.</p>
<div id="pARfML"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ke-pi068EXg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="deFzBr"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> will get a free content update with revised bosses, puzzle challenges, new amulets, new outfits, and more. There’s also story DLC coming in the form of <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown: Mask of Darkness</em> this September.</p>
<div id="rOzyOr"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZcC8TPRCpU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="bLpcl9">Evil Empire and Ubisoft also have an update coming for roguelite platformer <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia.</em> It’s called the Temple of Fire and it will bring even tougher challenges to the early access game.</p>
<div id="YutHBk"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="2CWWYg">But that’s not all. Ubisoft even brought out a trailer for its long-awaited <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake and... you’re going to have to wait a lot longer. Ubisoft announced a 2026 release window for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">the troubled game</a>.</p>
<h2 id="zCszcQ"><strong>XDefiant</strong></h2>
<div id="Zh2sO7"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IB4Lur9YjM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="mmWphI">Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, <em>XDefiant</em>, is getting its first season. That debut season will include new maps, a new Capture the Flag mode, new weapons, and a new faction: GSK from the Rainbow Six series. <em>XDefiant</em> season 1 launches July 2.</p>
<h2 id="fnOypI">
<strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana</strong> </h2>
<div id="5AlRR1"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJNzvo3UJb8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SZmmr2"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em>, the next entry in Ubisoft and Blue Byte’s 25-year-old economic sim real-time strategy game, is coming in 2025, letting players take on the role of Roman governor overseeing their growing empire. At Ubisoft Forward, we got a pretty silly live-action trailer that highlights the challenge of governing an ancient province when your most loyal subjects are goats. </p>

Neve is a detective who appears in the <em>Tevinter Nights </em>anthology book, as well as the comic book series <em>The Missing</em>. Neve has been investigating the extremist mage faction called the Venatori, which puts her in the sightlines of the Inquisition. She helps the group investigate Solas, the <em>Inquisition-</em>party-member-turned-<em>Veilguard</em>-antagonist, and it seems her involvement is only going to continue in the game when it launches this fall. BioWare describes her as a “cynic,” but she is fighting for a better future as part of the Shadow Dragons faction that fights to end slavery in Tevinter.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-recommend-id="image://c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis: The Mage Killer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis: The Mage Killer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-recommend-id="image://c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis: The Mage Killer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lucanis Dellamorte is a human rogue who works with the assassin’s organization the Anitvan Crows. The faction has been operating in the background of the <em>Dragon Age</em> series since <em>Origins</em>, but we haven’t had one in our party since Zevran in the first game. Lucanis appeared in the <em>Tevinter Nights</em> anthology in which he is set on a contract to kill a wigmaker and Venatori agent in Tevinter. The mission goes bad and Lucanis is presumed dead by the Crows. But death clearly suits him.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-recommend-id="image://abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara jumps out of an Eluvian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bellara jumps out of an Eluvian." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-recommend-id="image://abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara jumps out of an Eluvian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bellara is one of the newcomers in <em>The Veilguard</em>. She’s an elven rogue “Veil Jumper,” part of a group introduced in <em>The Missing</em> comics who formed to protect the Arlathan Forest in the Tevinter Imperium. BioWare describes her as “creative and romantic” and “obsessed” with discovering secrets of the universe. She’s seen jumping through an Eluvian mirror’s portal in the cinematic trailer with a smile on her face, even as she gets pulled back in by some kind of tentacle monster.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-recommend-id="image://df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich surrounded by magic lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emmrich surrounded by magic lights." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-recommend-id="image://df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich surrounded by magic lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Emmrich, the human Tevinter mage, is giving “Dorian Pavus’ grandpa.” The mustache-sporting necromancer was also featured in the <em>Tevinter Nights</em> anthology in which he’s shown to be a master of the dark arts of life and death. He’s part of the Mourn Watch, a group that are essentially keepers and maintainers of the dead. He’s so skilled in resurrecting and controlling the dead that he has a skeleton assistant named Manfred.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-recommend-id="image://38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin: The Warden." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin: The Warden." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-recommend-id="image://38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin: The Warden." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another newcomer in <em>The Veilguard </em>is Davrin. He’s brand new to the series, but his faction isn’t. Davrin is a member of the Grey Wardens, the Darkspawn-killing order that has been a figurehead in <em>Dragon Age </em>since <em>Origins</em>. BioWare says he’s “bold and charming” and is apparently a notable monster hunter. He’s also my new husband, probably. Maybe. If Lucanis doesn’t steal my heart.

She hasn’t appeared in any other <em>Dragon Age </em>media, but if the character trailer is any indication she’s clearly an adventurous fighter who is willing to take on whole-ass dragons by herself. Taash is part of the Lords of Fortune, a group of treasure hunters from the country of Rivain.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-recommend-id="image://f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric and Scout Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric and Scout Harding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-recommend-id="image://f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric and Scout Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Varric doesn’t seem to be a party member, the fan-favorite companion from <em>Dragon Age II </em>and <em>Inquisition</em> appears to be in some kind of leadership role in <em>The Veilguard</em>. He’s shown talking to Harding about recruiting all of these chucklefucks, so odds are he’ll play a major part in wherever the story goes. This guy’s been on the frontlines for two games now, so maybe it’s good that he gets out of the scrap for once.<br></p><p>That’s what we know about this new crew so far. Whether they live up to the highs of the past games remains to be seen. It’s gonna be hard to live up to characters like Dorian Pavus and Morrigan, but after ten years, I’m eager to see BioWare rise to the occasion.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-blends-new-and-classic-ideas-with-dual-protagonists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Deadly stealth and brute force working in tandem.</h2></div><section><p>16th-century Japan is ripe with fascinating historical context for an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-assassins-creed-games">Assassin’s Creed game</a> to thrive, which is one aspect that makes the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows so enticing. The way the series bends history for its fiction has me hyped to see its version of feudal Japan, but it’s also a setting that lends itself well to the kind of combat options that have been encompassed by the entire franchise.</p><p>In a hands-off preview demo of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I was able to see roughly 30 minutes of gameplay that showcased both Naoe and Yasuke – the two protagonists – and their combat styles in action. They represent both worlds of the series’ combat: Naoe, a stealthy shinobi wielding the iconic Hidden Blade, and Yasuke, a force of nature with pure power and masterful swordsmanship. </p><p>At the start of the demo, I saw Yasuke pulling up to a town where everyday people are squeezing out an existence under the boot of a corrupt shogunate that enforces a caste system. It’s a common dynamic in stories set in this era of Japan, but it’s also ripe for Yasuke to do right by the people who revere him. He has a commanding, respected presence, and the first combat encounter was against a group of samurai who were harassing a villager that shows off Yasuke’s swordsmanship. The challenge is to dodge or counter enemy attacks (indicated by blue and red glints on their blade) in traditional melee combat. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/ac-shadows-1718037568488.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t hold back when it comes to the brutality of its combat. Yasuke has finishing moves where he either slices enemies’ heads off clean or stabs them in the gut before lifting them up just to slam them back down. These finishers are also highlighted with black-and-white frame cuts with blood splattering, giving it a bit of the samurai cinematic flair. What’s just as brutal is Yasuke’s spiked club, which is a heavy blunt-force weapon that pounds armored foes. Seeing them take a swing straight to the dome brought a little, “Oooooh!” out of me. The point being that Yasuke is purely focused on melee, so while he won’t be doing a lot of climbing rooftops and jumping between buildings, he’ll hold it down by taking all his enemies head on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t hold back when it comes to the brutality of its combat.</p></div><p>After this introductory combat encounter, a cutscene shows Naoe burst onto the scene to help Yasuke by leaping onto an enemy and executing them with her Hidden Blade. Naoe and Yasuke have this sort of chummy dynamic as they decide how to take on their next mission: assassinate the daimyo at Fukuchiyama Castle. From here, you have to choose to either control Naoe or Yasuke, and this will determine your playstyle and how you navigate the mission to kill your target.</p><p>Playing as Naoe, you then have access to scaling walls, hiding in foliage, and stealthy kills. She’s not solely working with a Hidden Blade either; she has throwable kunai for ranged kills and a set of short swords to get her hands dirty up close and personal, should things go loud. But my favorite weapon of hers is the chained blade she can swing around in a circle to chop down crowds of enemies, which even slices through environmental objects. So while she is more focused on being nimble and staying out of sight, she still has some viable options as backup.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/acs3-1718037606123.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But of course, slipping past guards to nab those satisfying stealth kills seems to be worth the effort. Being able to move through the environment with tools like a grappling hook to get up on higher ground in a jiffy and assassinate unsuspecting guards almost reminded me of Tenchu, since it’s more about smartly using tools than just hiding in grass and waiting for patrol patterns to play out. Naoe channels traditional Assassin’s Creed energy, and her options definitely lean into the Splinter Cell fantasy that hasn’t really been fulfilled in the years since we last saw Sam Fisher in action.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Naoe channels traditional Assassin’s Creed energy.</p></div><p>If you play this same mission as Yasuke, you literally bust down the front door and provoke all enemies into combat. Watching him tear through guards almost reminded me of For Honor, another Ubisoft game, for how methodical it all seemed to play, even though it isn’t quite that in depth of swordfighting. Since this is the era of Japanese history that first introduced firearms via Western import, Yasuke also wields a single-shot rifle, and it's pretty wild to see a hulking samurai pull off headshots just before whipping out his katana to slice down the rest of the foes in front of him.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/screenshot-2024-06-10-093248-1718037644299.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whether you play as Naoe or Yasuke, the end result seems to be the same: you kill the daimyo and keep it moving. I’m not sure what the story implications will be depending on your choice, if any. But it’s nice to see two characters with fully realized playstyles with a number of weapons and tools so as to not get stuck into monotonous combat encounters. Granted, that will be determined by how quests are designed. Infiltrating Fukuchiyama Castle showed promise in this regard, but I would love to see if, or how, Shadows can mix and match the two protagonists in more natural ways.</p><p>I’m more curious now to get my own hands on Assassin’s Creed Shadows because I always appreciate how different weapons and gear create a distinct flow, especially for a series that’s recently been bouncing between different identities. For me, the most interesting aspects of this game will come from the creative freedom Ubisoft flexes when playing with its historical fiction. Yasuke is a fascinating figure in Japanese history and having a covert shinobi in Naoe contrast the ideals of highly regarded samurai sets my expectations quite high. At least now, I know I’ll be getting a more interesting gameplay dynamic than what I’ve seen from Assassin’s Creed’s recent past.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Assassin's Creed: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>From 2007's debut title to the upcoming console, PC, mobile, and VR projects, here is the entire Assassin's Creed series in one list.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-may-fulfill-that-galactic-scoundrel-fantasy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Uncharted territory for Star Wars.</h2></div><section><p>Some of the more interesting Star Wars content in recent years has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/andor-season-1-review">nothing to do with Jedi and Sith.</a> While their iconic push-and-pull of good versus evil has been a great framework for games like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars Jedi</a> series, honing in on the life of a scoundrel gives us the opportunity to see life in the galaxy from a different perspective. That’s the impression I got after getting hands-on with an hour's worth of gameplay with Star Wars Outlaws, the upcoming third-person action shooter from Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment.</p><p>It’s rough around the edges as of however old this build was, but exploring the galaxy as protagonist Kay Vess and getting into dirty business in this three-part demo was refreshing, even though a lot of its gameplay felt familiar. The best representation of this was a mission that started inside an Imperial base and sent me to sneak my way around to activate controls to move a cargo shipment, opening the way to steal a ship for a getaway. After knocking out some guards and hacking into some systems, I got into a shootout with Stormtroopers as I waited for the cargo to move into the ship I was going to steal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/swo-ubifw-trailblazer-combat-nologo-1718038781813.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kay isn’t exactly a force of nature and has to get scrappy, which meant well-placed shots, using cover, and commanding her little merqaal companion, Nix, to lend a hand were required to make it out alive. Kay’s blaster has a lethal and EMP-style modes, plus a one-shot knockout on cooldown, but she can also pick up enemy weapons for more firepower. Putting this all together was pretty challenging, but after making the escape I was then in control of an Imperial ship and getting into dogfights in space, channeling some of that Star Wars Squadrons energy into Outlaws. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of this happened seamlessly, moving from one thing to another at a brisk pace.</p></div><p>I then returned to the desert planet Toshara in the city of Mirogana, where the criminal underworld thrives, for the finale of this story mission. All of this happened seamlessly, moving from one thing to another at a brisk pace and encompassing all the aspects of what it takes to be a successful scoundrel in the Star Wars universe. Although I didn’t get to spend much time poking around Mirogana, it seems to be full of side content to give Outlaws that open-world feel to complement the linear story-based missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/swo-ubifw-reactor-grapple-nologo-1718038781815.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>I do think Outlaws sometimes relies too heavily on the design conventions of an Uncharted or Tomb Raider. For instance, another part of the demo had me platforming and climbing structures to retrieve a relic tucked away deep in this abandoned reactor. It seemed like every other room had the ground falling under me in an attempt to create tension, but we’ve seen this rug-pull trick far too many times for it to be a surprise. And the controls aren’t quite precise enough to make jumping gaps, scaling walls, or shimmying across ledges feel natural – this is something action-adventure games of this kind have figured out in years past so it’s a bit disappointing that Star Wars Outlaws struggles here. Hopefully that's on the fix-it list for the last few months before launch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Especially when you’re in the middle of a hostile encounter, minigames add a neat wrinkle.</p></div><p>The third segment of the demo had me infiltrating a base run by thieves on the dark and snowy planet Kijimi, and this had an emphasis on stealth and hacking mechanics. Although staying out of sight is all you really need to do, I wish the stealth mechanics were more robust. Kay struggles to stick to cover and Nix isn’t super helpful as a companion in this scenario, but once everything breaks into a shootout all of that becomes a moot point. The hacking minigames became more prominent, and I actually quite enjoy the rhythm-based lockpicking and the Wordle-style icon-matching one, which are clever little breaks in the traditional action. Especially when you’re in the middle of a hostile encounter frantically trying to hack into systems or past doors, these add a neat wrinkle to round out the gameplay flow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/swo-ubifw-wellspring-nologo-1718038781814.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>I wasn’t able to get the full context for the story happening in this mission, but Kijimi is a fascinating and more recent planet in the Star Wars universe that’s also deep with crime syndicates. Seeing Kay tip-toe around allegiances and get into sticky situations with competing factions makes me excited to see how Star Wars Outlaws presents that scoundrel fantasy. It’s like having a fully realized game based around the idea of being Han Solo, but having a new character in Kay Vess gives it room to breathe and create a new fiction within Star Wars, divorced from the canon or expectations that often puts pressure on the franchise.</p><p>So at this stage I can say that Star Wars Outlaws shows a lot of promise, but as usual we'll have to wait and see how many of the things that struck me as a little off can be smoothed out ahead of launch. (Never tell me the odds!) Even though it’s borrowing a lot from what we’ve seen in games like Uncharted and Tomb Raider, the Star Wars universe is ripe for that style of game. More stories outside of the Jedi-Sith framework are also appreciated, especially ones that dig deeper into the criminal underworld and the implications it has on the rest of the Star Wars world. Gameplay may not be as fluid or satisfying as the games that it’ll be compared to, or even the Star Wars Jedi series, but there’s a good variety of mechanics and systems that meld really well.</p><p>Hopefully it all comes together in the full game, which we won't have to wait for very long for: Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 27 of this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In November last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/troubled-prince-of-persia-remake-has-passed-an-important-milestone-ubisoft-says">Ubisoft said the Ubisoft Montreal project had passed an “important” internal milestone</a> and that development was “progressing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Prince of Persia's first delay arrived in December 2020, just months after its initial announcement, with an indefinite delay following in February 2021. Ubisoft made its most drastic shift yet when development was moved from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. Work has continued at the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla studio since, with the publisher confirming it had moved into the “conception” phase of development in May 2023.</p><p>The Sands of Time first launched on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and PC back in November 2003 to criticial and commerial acclaim. This hotly anticipated remake has been in the works for at least four years.

Plus, Ubisoft revealed Anno 117: Pax Romana and told us the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is coming in 2026. Read on to learn about everything that happened during the event.</p><h2>New Star Wars Outlaws Gameplay Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft kicked off the show with new gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws, showcasing gameplay across multiple systems in the galaxy. We got a great look at Outlaws' infamous hive of scum and villainy, which will feature corrupt officials and merchants to interact with. We also saw space combat, as Kay got into an optional dogfight that helped improve her standing with the Pyke Syndicate.  From there, the gameplay went to Tatooine, where we saw Mos Eisley Cantina, Kay traversing the desert on her speeder, and an infiltration mission where Kay tracked down an old gunslinger who can teach her a valuable skill. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-may-fulfill-that-galactic-scoundrel-fantasy">Star Wars Outlaws preview</a> to learn how the game may fulfill the galactic scoundrel fantasy.</p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws Overview Trailer</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After the gameplay demo, Ubisoft shared an overview trailer for Star Wars Outlaws, showcasing the cooperative dynamic between Kay and her companion Nix. We also got a look at the reputation system, where Kay can get unwanted attention from criminal syndicates depending on how she handles certain missions. </p><h2>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake Is Coming in 2026</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake has been in development for a very long time now, and today Ubisoft revealed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-set-for-2026">it's coming in 2026</a>. No footage was shown, but we do finally have at least a release window for the long-awaited remake.</p><h2>Assassin's Creed Shadows Gameplay Deep Dive</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We got a big look at Assassin's Creed Shadows, showing off the nature of the game's dual protagonist structure. In one instance, players were able to choose to play as Yasuke or Naoe to tackle a mission in one of two ways: The Samurai Yasuke wanted to rush through the front gates, while the Shinobi Naoe wanted to sneak along the rooftops. The gameplay footage showed us Naoe's path, as she snuck around castle grounds after nightfall. Check out our new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-blends-new-and-classic-ideas-with-dual-protagonists">preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to learn more.</p><h2>Anno 117: Pax Romana Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft announced the next entry in city-builder series Anno. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-finally-brings-the-city-builder-franchise-to-the-ancient-roman-empire-ubisoft-forward-2024">Titled Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, the new entry is taking the series to the long-requested setting of the Ancient Roman Empire.

Then, Ubisoft teased story DLC titled Mask of Darkness, which is coming this September. Additionally, The Rouge Prince of Persia: The Temple of Fire update is adding new content to the roguelite take on the franchise that hit early access earlier this year.</p><h2>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Is Coming Next Month</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We got a trailer for The Sky Breaker, the next big story DLC coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It's launching as part of the game's season psas on July 16.</p><h2>XDefiant Season 1 Starts Next Month</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft shared an update on XDefiant, revealing that Season 1 will begin on July 2. XDefiant is in its preseason right now, and the full Season 1 launch will add a ton of new features, including Capture the Flag, a new ranked progression system, three free new weapons, and one new map per month. We saw new maps called Daytona and Clubhouse which will join the XDefiant map rotation soon. A full reveal of Season 1 is coming on July 1.</p><h2>Skull and Bones Update</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Skull and Bones Season 2: Chorus of Havoc is underway, and we learned what the season will bring, including a Megalodon to face off against, a new maneuverable ship called The Brig, and time limited boat race events. Fleet management is on the way, too, which has been a requested feature from the community. Season 3 is titled Into the Dragon's Wake, and Ubisoft shared some of the new characters players can expect to face in the upcoming season, including a Flying Dragon sea monster to face off against, as well as a new 5v5 PvP mode.</p><h2>The Crew Motorfest Year 2 Roadmap Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A brand new island is coming to The Crew Motorfest's second year of content, as Ubisoft detailed what to expect from Year 2 of its live-service driving game.

Game Director Carrie Patel touched on these details during the interview, but the feature that might have fans the most excited is the promise that you will have the option to play in both first and third person.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/third-person-in-avowed-1718044506084.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>AVOWED HAS A THIRD-PERSON MODE.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Other details touched on in the presentation include a few colorful conversations with NPCs like Yatzli and Kai. Patel also teases some of the ways the environment will change as Avowed goes from day to night, as well as the ways different NPCs will react to your character’s Godlike status.</p><p>Like other RPGs, Avowed has a selection of skills to allow players to choose how they approach encounters, and yes, you'll be able to respec your trees if you eventually decide you don't like the path you've set yourself on. We see one scenario that is handled two different ways: with combat and with stealth. Using combat to reach an important NPC could anger them, blocking the player off from certain dialogue options and potentially useful rewards.

    <p><span>Massive Entertainment-developed Star Wars adventure due out on August 30.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Ubisoft [1,267 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Massive Entertainment [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft/massive-entertainment">Massive Entertainment</a> have released a 10-minute gameplay showcase, a game overview trailer, and new screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Star Wars Outlaws [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a></em>. <span id="more-891438"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>A new gameplay showcase video for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> debuted at Ubisoft Forward, following emerging scoundrel Kay Vess on a mission to Tatooine to find an expert gunslinger and convince them to help her upgrade her skills with a blaster. In addition, a game overview trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> premiered, providing a look into Kay and Nix’s past, the high-risk jobs they can take on, and the distinct locations they can explore in the <a title="Genres > Open-World [430 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p><p><strong>New Gameplay Showcase</strong></p><p>In the new gameplay video, game director Mathias Karlson breaks down one of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ expert quests.</p><p>“One of your motivations for exploration is to find elusive experts scattered across the galaxy who will help Kay pick up new skills to survive in the underworld,” Karlson explains.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the video, Kay gathers intel about a gunslinger on Tatooine. As she travels through space from the asteroid field in Akiva’s orbit on her ship, the Trailblazer, we see her come to the aid of a Pyke Syndicate freighter under attack by pirate starfighters; the Pykes are grateful for her assistance, and Kay’s reputation with the syndicate grows and may open up further opportunities with them in the future.</p><p>Once on Tatooine, Kay enters a planet where most of the economy is under the control of a different syndicate: the Hutt Cartel. She explores Mos Eisley, the legendary hive of scum and villainy, in search of the gunslinger. Karlson says creating Mos Eisley was a highlight for the development team: “Recreating this iconic city is a dream come true for our team, allowing us to show parts of Mos Eisley you’ve never seen before.”</p><p>Kay’s intel leads to a Hutt Cartel storehouse located in the southern hills; unfortunately, she has a poor reputation with the Hutts. They won’t simply let her through the front door—she’ll need to infiltrate the area without triggering the alarm or risk getting into a confrontation. Kay succeeds and finds information on the location of the gunslinger, but now she needs to make her escape, leading her into a shootout before fleeing the scene. At the end of the video, Kay finally meets with the expert gunslinger, Sherriff Quint.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_891436"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Game Overview Trailer</strong></p><p>The latest trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> details what makes Kay an original scoundrel, the underworld setting, and the galaxy of opportunity that awaits. Kay takes on high-risk, high-reward jobs to earn favor with the galaxy’s most notorious crime syndicates, including the cutthroat Pyke Syndicate, the crafty and cunning Crimson Dawn, amongst others. More of the locations Kay will explore are shown in detail in the video above, including the jungle world of Akiva, the ancient city of Kijimi, and the savannah moon of Toshara. There are flashbacks to Kay’s past growing up in Canto Bight, a memory of meeting Nix for the first time, and scenes of Kay hustling and thieving to survive</p></blockquote><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,280 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,568 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/star-wars-outlaws/645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Store</a> on August 30.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

<p data-characters="423" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I recently took a look at three different missions from developer Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft’s upcoming open-world adventure title <em>Stars</em> <em>Wars Outlaws</em>. It feels like <em>Star Wars</em> is getting a ton of game releases lately, which while good as a whole, has also led to a few missing the mark. Thankfully, it looks like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is staying true to the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and I’m excited to explore it.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Gameplay Showcase | Ubisoft Forward" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_O1eqWWbe4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, players will adventure to various planets in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, each one with unique gameplay elements and environments to explore. Throughout the three missions I saw many elements that have become staples all things <em>Star Wars</em> front and center in <em>Outlaws</em>. From zipping across the desert-like planet of Tatooine on a speeder to walking around a bustling cantina trying to get a meeting with a Hutt cartel.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">In one mission, players engage in a dogfight in space while piloting a ship called the Trailblazer with the nearby planet looming in the background. The space combat seemed very similar to that of <em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em>, which isn’t a bad thing. Dodging asteroids and space debris while flying around and dealing with enemies is always a good time, and it looks like the systems for doing so are a big part of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> rather than just an added sub-feature.</p>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">An important aspect of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is going to be the story. The premise is solid, but I’m still looking forward to the opportunity to dive into the massive open-world and explore the side quests and off-the-beaten path areas of <em>Outlaws</em>. But after seeing a few gameplay missions, it looks as though Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft are going in the right direction with the world design and level of immersion that very important to a <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p>
 <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="98" data-injectable="false"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is set to release on August 30 on PC Ubisoft+ Premium, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Avowed</em>, the next RPG from those famed RPG creators at Obsidian, got another trailer during the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Xbox Games Showcase</a> this weekend. The new footage confirmed it’s coming this year, but <em>Avowed </em>had a full release date revealed elsewhere before it was quickly removed.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1799950878432256254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Wario64 on X</a>, the <em>Avowed </em><a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story trailer blog page</a> on the official Obsidian site revealed a release date of November 12, 2024. But like the Troxler effect, not long after eyes were cast upon the date, it disappeared from the blog post entirely. </p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">The date came as part of a short quote provided by the game director, Carrie Patel. Today, the quote reads: </p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">“The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting. Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we’ve been busy with <em>Avowed </em>getting it ready.”</p> <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Using the cosmic powers of the Wayback Machine, I was able to confirm the release date on the pre-edited page. Originally, the quote continued to say, “for release on November 12, 2024.” And then it was gone.</p>

I recall a year where every other month felt like it had a game delay announcement or two. It could have been altered, whether due to a delay or something else. We can’t really know for sure. </p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">For the most part, Obsidian is still targeting 2024 for <em>Avowed</em>. The exact month and day may still be up to the fates, but the year hasn’t been changed yet. We may see the game around the fall regardless, nestled snuggly with others like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-opening-cinematic-is-exceptionally-hellish-expansion-set-to-release-october-8-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/max-is-back-trends-on-social-media-as-fans-celebrate-new-life-is-strange-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></em>.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft have revealed how<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </a>will play in a new video released as part of Ubisoft Forward.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<p>The game will have a full year cycle that will change the weather and give you different things to do depending on the season.&nbsp; Most importantly, you can also pet the doggos!</p>

<p>There will be three editions of the game, beyond the Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gold Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass (including a bonus quest with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions) and 3 days early access to the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack and 3 days early access to the game.

		<p>Yoou think you’ve won and defeated the RDA on Pandora? Think again. The Na’vi clans are threatened once more in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> – The Sky Breaker, the first story pack which will launch on 16th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Story Pack Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWq6m8rQMHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A mysterious shadow appears in the sky above Pandora, just as the Na’vi clans are celebrating their festival of games and victory over the RDA from the main campaign. Death and destruction follow and you’ll have to deal with another new threat to the native populace. This will take you to The Heart of the Plains, a new area of the Upper Plains with new environments to explore such as the Prism Fields, Feathered Grasslands, Stone Rapids and more. Here you’ll face the AMP Defender enemy type, which features an indestructible shield and top-mounted gatling gun, as well as new RDA lieutenants with AMP suits.</p>
<p>The Sky Breaker is included in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Gold Edition or will be available separately and in a season pass. Story Pack #2 will release later this year, dubbed Secrets of the Spires.</p>
<p>A technical marvel on consoles and PC alike – and especially after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-40-fps-performance-mode-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">the 40FPS performance mode patch</a> not too long ago – we loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</p>

        <p>Plus, Lost Crown update out today.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Prince of Persia: Sands of Time's troubled remake has resurfaced during tonight's Ubisoft Forward showcase with the news it'll finally be arriving in 2026, some six years after it was initially revealed. More happily, Price of Persia: The Lost Crown and The Rogue Prince of Persia both have new updates launching today.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">revealed</a> it was remaking Sands of Time back in September 2020, when it was originally due to launch the following January. However, following a less than positive reception to its debut trailer, Ubisoft announced the first of several delays for the project, eventually moving it from original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.
</p>
<p>
When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-gets-a-brief-update">last heard from the remake</a> at the end of 2023, Ubisoft announced it had "passed an important internal milestone", but things didn't sound especially far along given the publisher had revealed the rebooted project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">still in the "conception" phase</a> in May. A year on, it seems the Sands of Time remake still isn't a state that Ubisoft is confident to show; its re-appearance during tonight's showcase was anticlimactic to say the least, taking the form of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdhrdKu1SCA">30-second teaser trailer</a> showing... a candle. We did, at least, get an updated release window, with Ubisoft confirming the remake is now targeting a 2026 launch.

<p>
Thankfully, we're not short of Prince of Persia at the moment, so that elongated wait isn't so harshly felt. And today brings updates to both of Ubisoft's current Prince of Persia titles, starting with acclaimed Metroidvania, The Lost Crown. The third of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">three previously announced free updates</a>, titled Divine Trials, is available now, introducing new combat, puzzle, and platform challenges, as well as revised bosses, new amulets, and new outfits. Ubisoft has also revealed The Lost Crown's paid story expansion, Mask of Darkness, will arrive in September.

<p>
And that brings us to developer Evil Empire's The Rogue Prince of Persia, which today launches its first major early access update, Temple of Fire - introducing the titular Temple of Fire biome, new mobs, and new weapons. We've already been impressed with Evil Empire's work on this one - Christian Donlan called The Rogue Price of Persia a "lovely game, lovely on the eye and lovely in the controls" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">his preview</a> - so it'll be exciting to see how it evolves. And yes, at this rate, it'll probably have reached version 1.0 before we see Ubisoft's remade Sands of Time.

            <p>It’s been five years since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a>, but we’ve finally seen what’s next for Ubisoft’s history-hopping city-building series. Anno 117: Pax Romana will be the earliest period for the franchise yet, travelling back to the time of a peaceful Ancient Rome. After the biggest gap between Anno games yet, we at least won’t have to wait too long for the newly revealed entry: it’s out next year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anno 117 was revealed on-stage by developers Ubisoft Mainz - one third of series devs Ubisoft Blue Byte - during tonight’s Ubisoft Forward showcase. There was a fairly charming live-action skit about a guy spouting Roman scripture to an empty field of sheep, to make up for the fact we didn’t see any gameplay.</p>
<p>We did at least get some details, including the note that for the first time in the long-running series you’ll be able to choose between different starting provinces: choosing to rule over either the Roman empire of Latium or the Celtic Britain of Albion, looking to spread the cultural influence of either the Romans or the Celts accordingly.</p>

<p>That’s about all we know for now, with the rest sounding very much true to the Annoe we know - you’ll be seeking a successful civilisation through economic and cultural heft, rather than straight-up military campaigning, which will involve overseeing everything from hosting colosseum battles (including the naval battles ones where they turn the arena into a giant pool) to building aqueducts. While the earlier era means Pax Romana drops a digit from the Anno title years of old, keen-eyed fans will note that the individual digits still add up to the series’ hallmark total of 9.</p>
<p>Anno 117 will be released in 2025, and will be part of Ubisoft’s Ubisoft+ Premium subscription offering as well as by itself. We’ll find out more during a dedicated livestream on June 18th.</p>

        <p>It was originally announced back in 2020</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Ubisoft’s remake of time-rewinding Prince of Persia classic The Sands of Time has finally reappeared to tease - with the emphasis on tease - a release not this year, not next year, but in 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">The Sands of Time remake</a>, you might recall, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-announced">originally announced way back in 2020</a>. A do-over of the 2003 3D entry in the long-running platforming series, it was confirmed to be bringing back the Prince’s OG actor for a fresh recording while showing off a slightly more realistic visual style.</p>
<p>At the time, Ubisoft said to expect the Sands of Time remake in 2021. That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-to-2022">then slipped to 2022</a>, before slipping into “indefinite delay” territory - with pre-orders being refunded, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-isnt-cancelled-but-pre-orders-have-been-refunded">Ubisoft’s insistence the game was still in the works</a> - as original Sands of Time developers Ubisoft Montreal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-development-jumps-to-ubisoft-montreal">took over development</a> from their Indian colleagues in Pune and Mumbai.</p>
<p>Even three years after its original reveal - and two years after it had originally been schedule to come out - The Sands of Time remake was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-in-the-early-stage-of-development">still said to be in an “early stage” of “conception”</a> according to producer Jean-Francois Naud. Not exactly reassuring news.</p>

<p>Over a year on from that last update - and coming up on four years since it was first unveiled, for those keeping count - Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time reappeared, to describe its flitting tease generously, during tonight’s Ubisoft Forward showcase.</p>
<p>We didn’t see any gameplay, only a plume of smoke winding backwards to a candle in a holder in front of a blurry window with buildings visible in the distance. All that we got otherwise was a year: 2026. So, two years away. Which will put the release date of The Sands of Time remake - if it does indeed finally come out, rather than sliding into the void occupied by Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 - around six years on from its original announcement.</p>
<p>Still, an actual release is theoretically better than nothing, right? See you in two years to find out if the long wait has been worth it.</p>

            <p>It's a good thing I'm a big fan of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, because it's only that underyling fandom that's making me write this post about the upcoming story DLC. The tease during this evening's Ubisoft Forward did nothing for me, other than confirm a name, Mask Of Darkness, and a release window in September.

<p>The rest of the information in the trailer above focused on streamers reacting to the base game, and on free updates with additions that have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-adds-boss-rush-mode-extra-fast-travel-and-an-outfit-from-the-2008-reboot-if-you-can-unlock-it">already been released</a> or that we already knew were coming. They're not insubstantial, they're just not news.
</p>
<p>But I <em>do</em> really like The Lost Crown, which is probably my favourite game of 2024 so far. It's a great Prince Of Persia game, but also a great metroidvania in general, with tricky combat, a moveset that develops slowly over the course of the game, and some great puzzles and platforming challenges. If you don't believe me, read Katharine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review</a> for more.
</p>
<p>I'm glad that more of the game is on the way, and not just extra challenges that require a level of skill I don't possess, but proper story DLC. I just wish they'd shown more of it. As not-E3 crimes go, leaving me wanting more isn't the worst - although Ubisoft were guilty of the same thing when it came to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-resurfaces-after-years-of-silence-to-tease-a-release-in-2026">re-announcing the Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time reboot</a>.

			<p>During Ubisoft Forward, Ubisoft shared the release date for the first Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora story DLC, which will be released on July 16 on all platforms. The Sky Breaker Story Pack is included with the game's Gold Edition, but can also purchased separately for owners of the Standard Edition.</p>
<p><em>A mysterious shadow looms in the sky, threatening the Na’vi clans below who are celebrating at their great festival of games. Face the RDA and protect the unity of the clans in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora first Story Pack.</em></p>

<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched in December 2023. Developed by Ubisoft Massive, it earned a 7.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora pulls you in with its dazzling world, then pushes you away its frustrating combat. After a play session I 80 percent enjoyed, I’d leave with a sour taste in my mouth after repeatedly banging my head against some maddening RDA outpost. If you can handle this push and pull, there is plenty to enjoy here. Frontier of Pandora’s main campaign will take you around 20 hours, more if you’re easily distracted, and 100 percenting the game is at least a 40-hour effort. Whether you’ll actually want to explore until your face is blue is up to you.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the least explored in visual media, yet most yearned for among many <em>Star Wars</em> fans, is a story focused on those with no connection to the force, jedi, or lightsabers. Star Wars Outlaws is poised to perfectly satisfy that craving.</p>
<p>Set between <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, you take on the role of Kay Vess, a scoundrel looking to swindle her way to a new life. The criminal underworld is a complex one that Kay can take advantage of, pitting rival gangs against one another.</p>
<p>During my time with the game, a little over an hour, I got to play three different sessions. In one I escaped an Empire base, another I scavenged some rare materials from an old ship long ago crashed, and the last I infiltrated a gang's base to steal a valuable artifact.</p>

<p>My time on the Empire base was short, but I did get to see the simple hacking and lockpicking mechanics on display. I imagine it gets more complex, but the hacking I saw was to take 8 different symbols and correctly input three in order. You get some hints, like if it is one in the sequence or it is in the correct spot -- <em>Wordle </em>like you might say.</p>
<p>Lockpicking is certainly more interesting and rhythm-based. A light and tone will flash to a beat that you then have to match. It's simple but oh-so-satisfying, particularly when the lockpicking was a little more complex.</p>
<p>Once I hacked the mainframe to order an evacuation, making all the stormtroopers run out of the hangar with my ship in it, it was time to escape. Of course, there were still some enemies in the way.</p>

<h2>Outlaws Gunplay is Deliberate and Strategic</h2>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>is a third-person shooter with some light melee to get you out of a tight spot. Punching a stormtrooper in the face is indeed satisfying. Think <em>Uncharted</em>'s melee here.</p>
<p>The gunplay is strategic and more deliberate - <em>Outlaws </em>certainly isn't about running and gunning. Your regular plasma shots are good against the normal fodder, but you'll want to switch to ion shots to take out shields and droids. Then you can stun folks to instantly take them out, albeit with a cooldown.</p>
<p>Kay's trusty blaster doesn't have ammo, but you have a certain amount of shots before it overheats. If you time it right, you can get an instant reload, but in the thick of battle it's not an easy thing to consistently do.</p>
<p>Enemies can take a bit of a hit, so making sure your shots count is key. Getting stuck in a long reload with a bunch of stormtroopers bearing down is exactly where I found myself in the demo, and it made things way more stressful.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other tools like grenades and dropped enemy weapons you can use as well. Those are sparse, so using them wisely is a good idea as well.</p>

<p>There's no doubt you can get by with just the blaster running from cover to cover, popping out to pick off people one by one, but these stormtroopers are a little more accurate than their movie brethren, so that may not work for long.</p>
<p>Eventually I was able to get on my ship and escape into space. However, some pesky TIE Fighters had the audacity to try to stop me.</p>
<p>The dogfighting I did get to experience was brief, though it was satisfying and intuitive. It's certainly not quite as complex as <em>Star Wars Squadrons</em>, but Kay's ship is equipped with a few kinds of weapons and abilities to get out of a scrap.</p>
<p>What I experienced was pretty simple lock on targeting, where you had to keep aimed in a certain reticle to hit your enemy. Standard stuff.</p>
<p>Escaping the base introduced me to the wanted system, similar to that in the<em> Grand Theft Auto </em>series. The higher the wanted level, the more you have angered the Empire and they can send some pretty hefty assets to try to kill you.</p>
<p>Once I dispatched the TIE Fighters, I was able to go to a beacon that cleared my wanted level -- essentially clearing the tracking the Empire had on me.</p>
<p>After escaping, I was able to fly towards a planet -- Toshara Moon, a new location to <em>Star Wars</em> lore -- and check out the landing sequence. It is not<em> No Man's Sky</em> in that you'll just fly into a planet. Once you get close enough to one, you'll be prompted with a menu of where to land. That then starts a cutscene to that landing location.</p>
<p>I landed in Mirogana to see a bustling city full of people milling about. Unfortunately I did not have the time or ability in the demo to explore too much, but it was obviously fairly sprawling and I can't wait to see more of it. That session ended promptly afterward.</p>
<h2>Outlaws Exploration is Very Uncharted-like</h2>
<p>The next slice of gameplay took place in a crashed ship that had been there a while. I was there to scavenge something from the trip, so I spent my time climbing, parkouring, and figuring out how to get past jammed doors and the like.</p>
<p>This is where <em>Outlaws </em>will feel the most familiar. Pretty much any big budget third-person action game has the exact same exploration mechanics in its climbing and jumping around. Kay can rappel down and swing across gaps, but that's nothing new.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but think of comparing it to the <em>Star Wars Jedi</em> series, which features similar parkour and movement but has the added elements of force powers to make it more interesting. Plus wallrunning.</p>
<p>Kay could use her blaster's ion shot to power up some generators briefly, but that's pretty standard fare as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, what I saw and experienced was not exhaustive, so there's a good chance Kay will have some more tools and abilities at her disposal in the full game.</p>

<p>The final mission took place on the planet Kijimi, which you may remember from <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>. Its frigid mountains became a haven for all kinds of criminals, making it the perfect place for Kay to find some opportunities.</p>
<p>Essentially, Kay is on Kijimi to break into one of the big gang's strongholds and steal an ancient relic from one gang to then give to another gang.</p>
<p>Lurking around every corner of <em>Outlaws </em>are the various gangs in power. Kay's reputation with one or another will affect how people react to her and will of course change how those factions treat her.</p>
<p>Keeping a balance, or not if you choose to really hate one of the gangs, is an ever-present part of the decision making in <em>Outlaws</em>.</p>

<p>While going in to steal that relic, Kay's partner, ND-5, reminds her that she should probably be as quiet as possible and try to go unnoticed as she was stealing from the Crimson Dawn, a faction she had a good relationship with. If nobody is the wiser, then it's a win-win.</p>
<p>Stealth in <em>Outlaws</em> has quite a few options, mostly due to Kay's trusty sidekick and pet Nix. When skulking about, Nix can distract enemies, sabotage items to explode, and even crawl up stormtroopers to detonate the grenades on their belts.</p>
<p>With artifact in hand, I hit the streets of Kjimi. Just as before, I didn't get to explore much, but I did get to take a long guided pathway to the destination of my quest. There was obviously a lot to explore, it was just not open to me in the demo.</p>
<p>Kijimi featured a huge city with a ton of people. While running through it, there were points of interest galore. A haven for criminals that we can run around in is the best look we have had yet in the world of scum and villainy in <em>Star Wars</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Star Wars Outlaws Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>That aspect is what I am personally the most excited for in <em>Outlaws</em>. What helped set <em>Star Wars </em>apart from the beginning was how so much of the universe is run-down, used, and worn. Dirt, grime, and rust cover the daily objects people use.</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>is the first time we really get to dig in with what they day-to-day people in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe deal with. Jedi stories are often just too high level and take players to ruins or sterile environments, like Empire bases, or empty ancient ruins.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars </em>is a rich universe that is now spending some serious time beyond the Jedi, like with <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>Andor</em>. <em>Outlaws </em>joins those ranks to further expand the different unique lifepaths that make <em>Star Wars</em> so interesting.</p>
<p>We've had many games where we could be a Luke Skywalker stand-in, now we've all got a chance to shoot first as our own Han Solo.</p>

<p id="3rREGY">When you ask him to <strong>“give me the necklace,”</strong> he’ll offer to sell it to you for 1,000 runes. Buy <strong>Rya’s Necklace </strong>from him (despite the insults). While you’re here, speak with Boggart again and buy a <strong>boiled prawn</strong> from him — that will make him friendly to you and you can summon him in a later fight.</p>
<p id="bTdnq3">Return the necklace to Rya in here pavilion. She’ll finally introduce herself and invite you to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013379/questline-boss-invitation-locked-door-npcs-hidden-wall-secret-wall-stonesword-key-room">Volcano Manor</a> with the unsurprisingly named <strong>Volcano Manor Invitation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="6WciTP"><strong>How to reach Volcano Manor with Rya</strong></h3>
<p id="epTxqP">Rya’s next location depends on how you get to the Altus Plateau:</p>
<ul>
<li id="qzb8TB">If you found both halves of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24173497/dectus-medallion-left-right-locations-how-to-use-join">Dectus Medallion</a><strong> </strong>— one from <strong>Fort Haight</strong> in southeast Limgrave and the other in Dragonbarrow at <strong>Fort Farroth</strong> — Rya will be waiting for you at the top of the <strong>Grand Lift of Dectus</strong>.</li>
<li id="EudQC8">If you traveled through the <strong>Ruin-Strewn Precipice </strong>to reach the plateau, you’ll find her at <strong>Lux Ruins </strong>right next to the <strong>Erdtree-Gazing Hill Site of Grace</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="MlLHZZ">Meeting her in either of these places will let her teleport you straight to Volcano Manor.</p>
<p id="IkffOH">However, if you traveled straight into the Royal Capital through the <strong>Deeproot Depths</strong> as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23001617/fia-questline-quest-hug-ending-dagger-location-hold-you">Fia’s questline</a>, she won’t show up in either place.

<p id="zx7bCT">From the Altus Plateau and the <strong>Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace</strong>, head to the northeast and the <strong>Forest Spanning Greatbridge Site of Grace</strong>. There, you’ll find a portal that will take you to the north. Head southwest, through the <strong>Witherblood Ruins</strong> and across to the <strong>Bridge of Iniquity Site of Grace</strong>. From there, continue west and watch the cliffs on your left for a tall ladder that leads to the <strong>First Mt. Gelmir Campfire Site of Grace</strong>.</p>
<p id="hnsHvP">Keep heading generally west to cross some stone bridges and climb several more ladders. You’ll eventually come to a fight against a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013639/full-grown-fallingstar-beast-weakness-level-drops-reward-how-to-beat-melee">Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast</a> (you can just run away). From that crater, you can jump off to the west and wind your way down to the front door of the Volcano Manor.</p>
<h3 id="ldQjMa"><strong>How to reach Volcano Manor from the Academy of Raya Lucaria</strong></h3>
<p id="9DwUKr">Alternately, way back when you met <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23033809/patches-questline-location-chest-cave-volcano-manor-where-is">Patches</a> in Liurnia, he told you about an Abductor Virgin in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22971221/academy-of-raya-lucaria-map-tips-tricks-hidden-path-illusory-wall-strategy-red-wolf-radagon-rennala">Raya Lucaria</a> that can teleport you to “the base of the Erdtree” — he was, of course, lying. It actually takes you to Volcano Manor. Kind of.</p>
<p id="qeewRD">Head to the <strong>Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace</strong> and ride the elevator outside all the way to the bottom. Let Abductor Virgin there grab you (and kill you), and you’ll wake up in the basement of Volcano Manor. After a lot of exploring a lava-filled area and a fight against a pair of powerful Abductor Virgins, you’ll find an exit that will lead you to the <strong>Seethewater Site of Grace</strong> in Mt. Gelmir.</p>
<p id="LZeKCv">From there, you’ll have to loop counterclockwise around the huge lava lake, past <strong>Fort Laiedd</strong> and the <strong>Hermit’s Shack</strong>, and then through the <strong>Craftsman’s Shack</strong> and <strong>Hermit Village</strong>. After you deal with (or sprint past) <strong>Demi-Human Queen Maggie</strong>, you can cross the narrow stone pillar to reach <strong>Gelmir Hero’s Grave</strong>. Keep heading north, and you’ll meet up with the other overland route just before the part with all the ladders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175099/star-wars-outlaws-preview-impressions-stealth-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NArwqy">As I walked down the stairs of the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles, the location of Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> demo event at Summer Game Fest 2024, my accompanying PR person asked me the question I’m sure she asked every reporter who walked down those stairs with her: “Do you like Star Wars?” A simple question, and yet a weirdly hard one for me personally to answer in 2024. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23473565/andor-season-1-review"><em>Andor</em></a> was a revelation, yet I still taste the ash of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/12/18/21024586/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-spoiler-free"><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> in my mouth. And so, when I answered “yes,” I forced my brain backward into remembering why I had ever liked Star Wars in the first place.</p>

<p id="UWCBRl">As a child, the Harrison Ford fantasy-adventure movies that played over and over in my household were <em>not</em> Star Wars; they were Indiana Jones. For that reason, when my 12-year-old self finally saw Star Wars — previously ignored in the Myers family household — I was flabbergasted. I already thought I had seen the coolest possible Harrison Ford character, and yet here was Han Solo, who was <em>so</em> much cooler that he destroyed my entire barometer for coolness. All future “cool” characters would hereby be measured against him.</p>
<p id="pMtv3J">As I told this polite, probably bored PR person that story, I realized I was summarizing how difficult of a situation <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> actually faces. Imitating Han Solo’s coolness is no small feat, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/15/17353438/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-alden-ehrenreich"><em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em></a> unfortunately showed how difficult it is for somebody who isn’t Harrison Ford to pull off anything close to his alchemical coolness formula. At this point, the whole idea of an open-world Star Wars game in which you play as a Han Solo type is the pipe dream that dorks like me have been claiming they want for years (and it even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ragtag">almost happened</a> once). That means the stakes are even higher — and the couple of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date">trailers</a> we’ve seen for the game have made it look <em>fine</em>, but not great.</p>
<p id="6FACL4">Now that I’ve played three 30-minute chunks of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I have some hope that developer Massive Entertainment can actually pull this off.</p>

<p id="bp0R7A">When the demo loaded up, the introductory screen promised me “scoundrel gameplay,” a hilarious phrase that admittedly got me into the right mindset. The first sequence started in an Imperial base, where heroine Kay Vess and her tiny little alien friend Nix are sneaking around. Nix serves a similar gameplay function to the droid companion BD-1 in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23696594/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-release-date-ps5-xbox">Star Wars Jedi</a> games, but has the same lax moral code and ride-or-die BFF sensibilities as Chewbacca.</p>
<p id="ReQnmS">A little blue circular indicator would appear on screen any time I could call on Nix for help, either to distract an enemy or to pick up a valuable item for me. From moment one of seeing Nix fling his tiny body at a stormtrooper’s face, I fell in love with my badass little buddy. I then took advantage of almost every moment that I possibly could to call upon Nix, since it was a lot cuter to watch him scamper around picking up items for me than to walk over and do it myself. Nix is not exactly a powerhouse in combat given his size, of course, but he can certainly throw off bad guys and grab health packs.</p>
<p id="GG4v5B">It’s possible I could have snuck my way past this first section, but I’m about as good at that as Han Solo would be (“I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around,” as he says). So by the time I reached the station’s docking bay, I had triggered a shootout with Imperial forces. Once my own starship arrived to bail me out, I ran right past the laser fire onto it and flew out of there with the Empire on my heels. Then it was time for some dogfighting. I dispatched a couple of TIE fighters and flew over to a communications satellite, which I then hacked to clear my “wanted” status so that the Empire wouldn’t keep on chasing me around. Mission complete.</p>

<p id="lopGgd">The second 30-minute chunk appeared to take even more significant inspiration from the Star Wars Jedi games, which have their fair share of parkour-based environmental puzzles. Before that bit began, I did get to check out a more densely populated hub area where I could see question marks on the waypoint marker at the top of the screen and overhear conversations with NPCs that probably could have led to side quests. Once I got to the place Kay was told to go, I found an excuse for some parkour and platforming, as Kay took a cue from Nathan Drake (you know, the <em>other</em> character inspired by a Harrison Ford performance). </p>
<p id="0046Cs">People who hate seeing convenient yellow paint on various surfaces in order to be able to tell where your character can climb will not be fans of this aspect of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, but as somebody who gets lost in games constantly, I appreciated it. Kay doesn’t have Jedi powers like Cal Kestis, but she has definitely been to the same rock climbing gym or whatever. She also has a grappling hook, plus an electric setting on her sidearm that lets her power up elevators and other devices for puzzle-solving purposes. Almost this entire sequence was enemy-free platforming and exploring, climbing across various hazards to flip switches. It was fine; you’ve played something like this before in any number of third-person action games in the post-Uncharted landscape.</p>
<p id="ovTrZm">The third and final 30-minute segment of this demo was where I really got my scoundrel on. In this section, I was stealing an artifact — one that had apparently been previously stolen from some other faction, to whom Kay intended to return it. This sequence was far more clearly intended to be a straight-up stealth mission, and I stayed undercover for at least the first few minutes, creeping Samus-style through air shafts and doing silent takedowns of guards until one of them dropped a keycard I needed. Soon there weren’t as many enemies left, and I had noticed some conveniently placed explosive barrels, so I decided to go with a full Han Solo-style shootout (with Nix’s help, as usual). This was significantly louder and a lot more fun. After clearing out the room, I grabbed the artifact, then shot my way out of the rest of the building.</p>
<p id="LdUG1N">As she walked, Kay had a fun conversation over her communicator with one of her shipmates, a mysterious droid ally named ND-5. What I remember about the conversation was Kay being mocked for assuming that by returning this artifact, she wouldn’t be presumed to be the original thief herself. ND-5 told me I should be “terrified.” Kay responded with the equivalent of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuck-it-we-ball">fuck it, we ball</a>.” I didn’t get to see how the rest of the scene played out, but I really liked the whole heist setup, and the banter was refreshingly snappy.</p>

<p id="JOHOM2">The best thing about the “Han Solo simulator” concept is that you’re playing as a Star Wars character who doesn’t have a lot of power — no Jedi powers, obviously, but also no significant social or structural power. The actual power fantasy here is being a cool person with high charisma, because that’s really all you’ve got. Well, also a grappling hook and weirdly good parkour skills, but you get where I’m going with this. It’s part of why <em>Andor</em> was an interesting slice of the Star Wars pie; it was about regular people, albeit regular people who became rebels rather than scumbags. It’s fascinating to see what the Star Wars universe looks like at ground level rather than from an epic space-opera vantage point — and that’s what an open-world Han Solo simulator could potentially achieve, provided it has some decent story beats and good one-liners along the way.</p>
<p id="OVzwlk">Based on what I played, whether you like this game will depend in part on whether you like the Uncharted and Star Wars Jedi games. And yet, those aren’t open-world games, and I didn’t get to see enough of the hubs or side quests to know if <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is going to be as sweeping and borderline overwhelming as some other Ubisoft open-world games have been (looking at you, <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>).</p>
<p id="FYH81S">The biggest responsibility of all — being the Han Solo at the center of the simulator in question — rests on Kay’s shoulders. I’m now very curious to see if she can handle that challenge this Aug. 30 when <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is released for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. </p>

<p>During today’s Ubisoft Forward showcase, Ubisoft revealed a brand-new look at Assassin’s Creed Shadows featuring an in-depth gameplay walkthrough.</p>



<p>You can watch the brand-new gameplay walkthrough below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Most recently, Ubisoft surprised fans with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer/">a new trailer</a> for Assassin’s Creed Shadows during the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>



<p>The official game description reads, “In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you will live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan. From chaos to purpose, from darkness to light. A new Creed rises over Japan.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to ramp up marketing for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Last month, Ubisoft revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-editions-preorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the game editions</a>, and later an anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a>.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ubisoft also confirmed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-require-a-mandatory-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not require a mandatory connection</a> at all times. Players will get to explore and enjoy their journey completely offline.</p>



<p>Following some datamined leaks, fans also got a potential glimpse at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season Pass and DLC prices</a>. The leaks imply that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is due to receive at least two post-launch expansions.</p>
