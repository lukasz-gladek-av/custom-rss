			<p>Amidst controversies <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">surrounding its use of Generative AI tech for NPC voices</a>, Embark Studios' latest release, the third-person extraction shooter ARC Raiders, continues its sales streak, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-dominated-steam-again">Alinea Analytics</a>, it has almost reached 7 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p>After selling close to 750K copies on Steam last week, Alinea Analytics reports that ARC Raiders is at 4 million copies sold on Steam alone, and is due to reach the 7 million mark soon. Last week, the game's publisher, Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">reported that it had officially sold over 4 million copies.</a> </p>



<p>It's further proof that ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the video game industry's biggest hits in 2025. It was even one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shooters-dominated-october-2025-revenue-mau-charts-battlefield-6/">top 20 games for MAU and revenue in Newzoo's October 2025 report</a>. Though, as is the case with all multiplayer games, a strong launch is only the beginning. Now, it's about consistency in the long run. It'll be interesting to see where the game stands a year from now.</p>



<p>Other notable titles in Alinea Analytics' latest report include PEAK closing in on 15 million copies sold, making it one of the biggest indie titles of the year. RV There Yet? and AdHoc Studio's Dispatch were also two of the top-selling games on Steam last week, as indie games continue to have a strong showing this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto reviewed ARC Raiders</a>, giving the game a 9/10 and praising its sound design, gameplay loop, map design, and more. "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

            <p>
I'll be honest with you folks, as aware as I have been about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, i.e. Not The Witcher 3 from some of the folks who helped make The Witcher 3, I have felt very disinterested in it. Sure, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/freshly-spilled-blood-of-dawnwalker-footage-reveals-an-action-rpg-where-witcher-dialogue-meets-wall-walking">recent look at gameplay</a> certainly paints a polished at minimum picture, but at a cursory glance I have to admit I did just kind of write it off as vampire Witcher. Except I've now been quite quickly pulled in thanks to an important element of the game shared by its director in a new interview: there's no main quest.
</p>
<p>
This comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">Eurogamer</a>, who spoke with game director (and Witcher 3 co-director) Konrad Tomaskiewicz about this very fact. After clarifying that "no, there's no main quest" in The Blood of Dawnwalker, Tomaskiewicz explained, "You build your experience from the quests you encounter. You know where your [enemy is]. You can attack this place anytime you want to. It's up to you if you want to do it by yourself, or if you want to build yourself, find the powerful items, develop your character, or do some quests and find allies to help you do it."
</p>
<p>
Here's a line that I like in particular from Tomaskiewicz: "We want to bring video games closer to pen-and-paper RPGs and give you the freedom to experience what you want to experience." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> as a genre is quite obviously popular, but a majority of them are ultimately quite constrictive in what you can actually do. There's limits in the world of video games! Understandable limits, but I'm always curious to see how someone might try to break them.
</p>
<p>
This ability to attempt to achieve your goal isn't exactly a novel thing technically, later on Tomaskiewicz compares it to Fallout: "Our game is more similar in this area to the old Fallout, the first and second [games], where you have a clear goal and everything is optional - you decide. You travel the world, you decide what you want to do. There is no main quest." 
</p><p>
Not to mention the fact that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lets you seek out the final boss almost right from the start. However, Fallout is obviously quite an oldschool RPG by now, and Breath of the Wild sits in a weird place genre-wise, plus it does have a main story, so I'm keen on seeing how Blood of Dawnwalker tackles such a structure.
</p>
<p>
The Blood of Dawnwalker is due for release sometime in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Rockstar Games employee dismissals have dominated gaming headlines for several weeks. Now, a new report has revealed the Discord messages that are believed to have led to the termination of 34 Rockstar Games workers.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported back in October about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Workers allegedly being fired to prevent union forming.</a> Since then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games has claimed that the fired employees were leaking information</a>. There have been protests since, and the company has since been hit with legal action over the firings.</p>



<p>But now, a new development has seemingly uncovered the actual Discord messages at the root of everything.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-allegedly-accessed-union-discord-server">Rockstar Games Allegedly Accessed Union Discord Server</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A dark period for Rockstar. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> released an eye-opening video on November 24 titled: “The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members.”</p>



<p>The reporter claims that they have “since spoken to a Rockstar insider, who has shared screenshots with People Make Games of what they believe to be the messages sent just a few weeks ago on that Discord server, which directly contributed to the firings of these 34 former employees. We also know how Rockstar got hold of these messages as well.”</p>



<p>According to People Make Games, the source is “not one of the fired workers” and isn’t even part of the union. The Discord server has apparently been around since 2022 and consisted of various Rockstar employees.</p>







<p>The reporter’s source claims that “They couldn’t recall a single example of any confidential game details being shared.” It’s said that the beginning of October 2025 saw Rockstar Games revise its policies pertaining to the company Slack—a messaging platform usually used by workplaces.</p>



<p>Various non-essential chats were removed, with the company claiming them to be a “distraction” and a source of “poor conduct”. </p>



<p>This “Slack purge” did not go down well. The union Discord server discussed these changes, with one individual saying: “I would really like to see the evidence for them being too much of a productivity hit. I can’t imagine it being worth the absolute dumpsterfire this will be for morale.”</p>



<p>It’s alleged that Rockstar’s Slack revision email was sent out after 5 PM—and employees can’t check their emails outside of work—and a second email about guidelines and conduct was also pushed. The emails were shared by people still in the office on Discord to inform other colleagues who hadn’t seen them yet.</p>



<p>“This led to one member of the Discord approaching studio management to express concerns about the discussions taking place,” the report adds. Additionally, “I’m told this either contributed to or kicked off an investigation into the Discord by the company, which does line up with the timings we now understand.”</p>



<p>The report claims it’s likely Rockstar did manage to access the union Discord server. Soon after, the whole world learned of the firings, with Rockstar presumably identifying individuals in the union chat who had broken guidelines, weren’t adhering to policy, and potentially attributed this to leaks.</p>



<p>You can see recreations of the Discord messages in the full video below.</p>

<p>Now, for those who have been paying attention to all the character reveals and behind-the-scenes looks in recent months, some of this footage might not be all that new; if, however, you're coming in with fresh eyes, be prepared for some Saturday morning cartoon nostalgia.</p>
<p>The opening film provides a neat character-by-character rundown of the game's 15-fighter roster, each reimagined in the '90s cartoon visuals that Tribute has so clearly been inspired by.</p>
<p>We get to see Captain America and Spider-Man taking out Annihilus' bug bros on the streets, Beta Ray Bill and the Silver Surfer handing out beatings in space, and even a handful of familiar foe faces like that of Thanos, Galactus, and Modok.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like Cosmic Invasion will go a long way to scratch a similar nostalgic itch that the developer/publisher duo hit upon with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> back in 2022. There's only one week to go until we find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nioh 3 will be the first game in Team NINJA's fantasy action RPG series to be published by the studio's own parent company, Koei Tecmo. The first two games were published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, which meant they launched first on PlayStation consoles and only later on PC, whereas the new one will be available on PS5 and PC at the same time.</p>



<p>That's far from the only change in this third entry. Another big one is that it will offer an 'open field' environment instead of the relatively linear maps seen in the previous two installments. This, as explained by producer Fumihiko Yasuda <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/nioh-3-i-producer-del-team-ninja-ci-hanno-svelato-tutti-i-retroscena-del-progetto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Multiplayer.it</a>, will make the game more accessible than the first two Nioh games, and the team also avoided sudden difficulty spikes that could make the game unpalatable to newcomers. However, the overall level of challenge remains as high as customary for an action game created by Team NINJA, a studio known mainly for the Ninja Gaiden series (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just received an excellent new release</a>).</p>



<p><em>There are players out there who probably invested thousands of hours in the Nioh series, but there are many more who may be interested in Nioh 3 as newcomers, and I'd like everyone to be able to enjoy the game. For newcomers, we have added a very thorough, albeit not excessive, tutorial. But the most important thing was to ensure that the game wouldn't have sudden difficulty spikes. Everything must happen gradually. The exploration has much more freedom, but there are also very tough foes to defeat on the open field. What we focused on was offering players many more ways to defeat the bosses, be it equipment or the exploration itself. But the challenge level typical of our games was not reduced.</em></p>



<p><em>I always thought that the focal point, which is really important for this game, is how you face defeat. Perhaps in a demo like the one we showed at Tokyo Game Show, you are defeated, and that can be frustrating. But what really matters is what the player thinks after being defeated. What do I have to get? How do I have to prepare to win? We chose to offer many options so that players could find their own way to victory, to defeat those powerful bosses. Ultimately, being able to succeed, the exhilarating sensation that comes with that, discovering that you could indeed beat that boss, is very important, and it was essential that we maintained that in Nioh 3, too.</em></p>



<p>Nioh 3 will be released on February 6, 2026 for PC and PlayStation 5. You can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our recent hands-on preview here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I haven’t seen the full </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>stage play, but I was already well aware of the twists and turns we’d see in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>.</span></a><span> The musical sequel covers the events of the play’s second act, and it includes several direct ties to the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> story. As such, I was braced for it to reveal the brainless Scarecrow, but I was not prepared for how the guy would actually look when on screen, and neither were most people, it seems, as the reveal has caught fans off guard.</span></p>  <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>continuity, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span>), the carefree prince who starts growing a conscious after he meets Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), becomes the Scarecrow. He starts off as a dashing, charismatic narcissist, but as Fiyero grows to care for Elphaba and her battle for animal rights, he turns against the Wizard’s fascist regime and becomes a fugitive with the Wicked Witch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Later in the film, he is captured by the Wizard’s guards and tortured. Elphaba, desperate to save her lover, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTv_FrdBQ6A&amp;pp=ygUTd2lja2VkIG5vIGdvb2QgZGVlZA%3D%3D"><span>casts a spell to keep him from dying or feeling any pain</span></a><span>. We don’t see Fiyero’s face for almost the entirety of the second half of the movie because </span><i><span>For Good </span></i><span>goes out of its way to obscure it and hide his identity, but we unknowingly see the back of his head a few times. That’s because Elphaba’s spell turned him into the Scarecrow who accompanies Dorothy in </span><i><span>The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We don’t actually see Fiyero as the Scarecrow until the final moments of </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, and while an eagle-eyed </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>fan may have caught onto this twist when he was strung up on a cross in a cornfield during Elphaba’s spell, plenty of first-time viewers were genuinely shocked by this reveal, not only because of Fiyero’s dark fate, but because Bailey straight up looks like a patched together version of Ryan Reynolds in his Scarecrow look.</span></p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My entire theater burst out laughing when they saw the Scarecrow's design</p> <p>— 5 DAYS UNTIL DON CHEADLE'S BIRTHDAY (@Schaffrillas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Schaffrillas/status/1991721384129777945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">out mogged the wicked for good scarecrow <a href="https://t.co/CHKems9MTo">pic.twitter.com/CHKems9MTo</a></p> <p>— 👹 (@tummyhxrts) <a href="https://twitter.com/tummyhxrts/status/1992245081273991321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">also happy to report fiyero looks chopped asf as the scarecrow like even tin man boq is out mugging him <a href="https://t.co/lrDdCGEHAQ">pic.twitter.com/lrDdCGEHAQ</a></p> <p>— gelphie conquers all (@aIicentinchains) <a href="https://twitter.com/aIicentinchains/status/1990796884131426684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While some might be unsettled by Fiyero’s new face, others aren’t going to let some straw and burlap keep them from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHed_tTvyhI"><span>recreating that one scene from </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i></a><span>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extract-rat-elevator-revive-defib-2000646958</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Extraction shooters are eager to take everything away from you. And though <i>Arc Raiders</i> has proven to be a more friendly approach with its multiple paths of progression, dying at the end of a successful run still sucks. Getting pushed 99 percent of the way to failure and then surviving, however, is a feeling like no other.</p> <p>As more folks pour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers to hopefully extract and craft their way to glory, they’re capturing epic victories snatched from the jaws of defeat and sharing them as reminders that even when you think you’re about to lose everything, luck (or a guardian angel) can always intervene.</p>

 <p>Last night, I came across one such clip from a few days ago of what would seem to be an unfortunate PvP instance during a Night Raid (usually a preem opportunity to score some great loot if you know where to look) suddenly turned on its head:</p>

   <p>Gunned down by a rando, Reddit user Over_here_vibin prepares to get sent back home with nothing to show for it. Then his assailant gets sniped in the head literally out of nowhere. Turns out, some folks must’ve been watching nearby and were quick to put down the threat while also escorting Over_here_vibin to extraction.</p>

 <p>Fun fact learned from this video? If you don’t have a defib to revive a stranger, you can use bandages to temporarily stabilize them, which is often enough to see someone successfully get out.</p> <p>Humans aren’t your only potential allies, though. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-karma-doesnt-get-any-sweeter-than-this-extract-camper-gets-a-spoonful-of-justice-from-bots-accidentally-saves-his-would-be-victim-and-misses-his-own-extraction/">spotted by <i>Games Radar</i></a>, another fantastic clip sees someone gunned down literally as they’re standing in the elevator. If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, then you know getting shot in the elevator is literally one of the worst feelings (especially as it often happens right as the doors are closing, meaning your assailant doesn’t even have time to loot your body and just offed you seemingly just for the fun of it).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Beautiful ❤️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <br>🎥RedRiser <a href="https://t.co/RkAYVow0rL">pic.twitter.com/RkAYVow0rL</a></p> <p>— ARC Now (@ArcRaidersNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersNow/status/1991792146995986490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As luck would have it, a Rocketeer (one of the most menacing of airborne threats in the game thus far) not only interrupts the execution animation, but knocks the assailant out of the elevator with a rocket, downing them in the process. While it is possible the assailant might’ve been able to crawl over and call in a new elevator, it’s likely their decision to shoot someone in the back led to their loss.</p> <p>My feeds are full of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueRaiders/comments/1ovl0bh/got_rescued_today_was_this_one_of_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">situations like this</a>. It just goes to show that, until the game literally sends you back to Speranza, don’t give up. A friendly human, or Arc, might just save the day.</p>   <p>Oh, and if you run solos, please carry defibs for your fellow Raiders!</p>

<p>Activision has announced what’s it’s calling “the biggest Black Ops season one ever”. In a post on social media, it was revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 will kick off on December 4, and it’ll include a number of updates and additions for players.</p>



<p>Season 1 of the annual shooter will feature six additional multiplayer maps. It’ll also include what’s being described as “an out-of-this-world Round-Based Zombies map” and two new Survival experiences. </p>

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-is-giving-off-serious-animal-crossing-and-minecraft-vibes/1100-6534702/" data-ref-id="1100-6534702">it was announced</a> in September 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> appeared to be the franchise's cozy-game answer to Animal Crossing and Minecraft. But after the recently released extended trailer for the game, fans have pointed out intriguing and dark links to some of the previous titles in the franchise.</p><p>It's almost unsettling that one of the first things seen in the extended trailer is a devastated Pokemon Center and a generation-one Pokedex. As noted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-upcoming-pokemon-pokopia-may-have-a-deeper-link-to-classic-games-fans-believe-heres-what-we-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), one of the fan theories suggests that Pokopia is set on Cinnabar Island from the Kanto region, which was originally featured in Pokemon Blue, Red, and Yellow. As depicted in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cinnabar Island was devastated by a volcano eruption that left a Pokemon Center as one of the last remaining structures, much like the one glimpsed in Pokopia's trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDh6COB0Nqk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Professor Tangrowth--a character introduced in the trailer--mentions that he hasn't seen humans in a long time, but the island has other evidence that people once lived there including roads and other buildings. The strange Pokemon variations introduced in the trailer--like the stark-white Pikachu known as Peakychu--may have been created at Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pokemon Mansion was the place where Ditto could be found in the original Pokemon games.</p><p>Pokopia puts players in control of a Ditto that assumes human form and utilizes borrowed powers from other Pokemon to transform the landscape into a sanctuary free of human conflict. There don't appear to be any battles or a larger story in the game. But if it is set in a post-volcano explosion Cinnabar Island, it would be fitting if the land were healed by masterless Pokemon who weren't forced to fight each other.</p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will hit Switch 2 on March 5, 2026. In the meantime, fans of the franchise can immerse themselves in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That game has introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-has-found-a-new-way-to-battle-but-it-needs-to-evolve-past-that/1100-6536431/" data-ref-id="1100-6536431">a new way for Pokemon to battle</a>, but it may need some work before it can become a competitive esport.</p>

                <p>After three years of mysteriously absent email-checking, Strong Bad has finally smashed his boxing-gloved fists onto the keyboard once more, returning with a brand-new message for his loyal fans. And in true Strong Bad fashion, it's about robots--again--and this time they apparently want to discuss their favorite sauces. His comeback feels like stepping back into Free Country, USA itself: chaotic, ridiculous, and somehow still deeply important to a generation. It also offers the perfect opportunity to revisit the era when Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner cast broke out of browser windows and into full-fledged video games.</p><p>The most defining gaming moment for the franchise came with the Telltale game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/1900-6195688/" data-ref-id="1900-6195688">Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</a>, a five-episode point-and-click adventure released throughout 2008. The game played like an interactive Homestar Runner cartoon, built in close collaboration with the Brothers Chaps, who supplied writing, design input, and voice work. Guiding Strong Bad through his latest harebrained schemes--from band competitions to clumsy attempts at political takeover--gave fans a new way to revel in the character's larger-than-life personality, all while exploring familiar territory like the House of Strong and Bubs' Concession Stand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zhsNdk1_Vc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zhsNdk1_Vc?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A large part of the game's charm came from its faithfulness to the original Flash cartoons. While it followed Telltale's traditional adventure formula, the world was loaded with oddball interactions, surreal conversations, and puzzles that functioned less on logic and more on the internal rules of Homestar Runner's absurdity. Each episode came packed with extra features, such as bizarre arcade minigames, collectible Teen Girl Squad cards, and hidden Easter eggs that rewarded longtime fans who had practically memorized the old website.</p><p>The success of that series helped cement the Homestar Runner universe as a surprisingly adaptable landscape for games. Beyond the Telltale collaboration, the franchise had already experimented with interactive experiences through its own iconic web games--Peasant's Quest, Stinkoman 20X6, and TROGDOR!--and later through the revival of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rMCkNgHa3c" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trogdor!! The Board Game</a> and its digital version. Even when Strong Bad wasn't hogging the spotlight, his attitude, snark, and tendency to go off the rails remained woven into the fabric of these projects. With his latest return to the inbox, he's once again reminding the world that Free Country, USA is only an email away.</p>

"Roblox will invoke it and has invoked it because every tech company automatically invokes it when they get sued," she said. "But they are grossly-overinterpreting the application of that statute. In our view, that statue is designed to do is to limit liability in cases where an internet service provider is...publishing someone else's material."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: Savvy Games Group's Saudi-owned parent fund is running low on investable cash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She described how the firm's cases center on how these apps are released without adequate safety features while purportedly misrepresenting a their safety protections for underage users.

When asked about this, Walsh said there was a distinction in how other platforms like Instagram have "some attempt" to enforce their age minimum policies, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> provides minimal friction for when underage users sign up for the platform.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're not saying that any particular measure is going to be perfect 100% of the time," she said in allusion to age-gates that might, for example, require a parent's email address to create an account. "But at least it's some friction...at least it's making some kids pause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Walsh said it's "easy" for kids on Discord to turn parental controls off without their parents' knowledge. Predators take advantage of this capability to lure their targets into lowering protective barriers. A better system might be one that automatically notifies parents when these controls are turned off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two platforms are linked through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Discord integration. The Florida-based predator who abused Ethan Dallas—the child of one of Walsh's clients—reportedly lured Dallas off of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and into Discord where he was able to further sexually exploit the teenager.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dallas died by suicide in April 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a gaming platform that is heavily marketed and promoted as being safe and appropriate for children," Walsh said.

But in a conversation with Game Developer, he explained communication platforms of all stripes have been repeatedly found not liable for abusive messages sent on their platform because of Section 230. It may sound counterintuitive, but these protections enable the existence of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>any</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> online moderation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before Section 230's existence, internet service providers CompuServe and Prodigy both faced lawsuits for their policies about moderating what users posted on their servers. The former company said it would not moderate any content, while Prodigy said it would. Both were sued, and Prodigy was the one to be found liable for content hosted on its servers even though it was the one with a moderation policy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mackey said the law was created to let services to decide for themselves about what kind of speech to allow on their platform, and offer protections when they enforced those policies. That raises the bar for civil suits about messages sent between users.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There appear to also be protections for generic promises about child safety on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord. "There are cases in which plaintiffs have tried to raise this claim, which is that they're not seeking to hold [platforms] liable for the content of the communication but for representations about what they would do to protect users," he said. "Those cases have not succeeded."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The courts have also ruled that Section 230 provides immunity for claims that cover the account creation process. "The courts ruled that 230 applied because the services decision to offer public accounts was inherently connected with the ability for account holders to create, view, share content on the service," Mackey said. "A legal claim that sought to change or limit the service’s ability to have the account-creation process it wanted would implicate 230 because it necessarily seeks to impose liability based on the third-party content on the site.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cases that have succeeded centered on specific promises made by online platforms to specific users. Mackey recalled a case reviewed by the Ninth Circuit about a user who faced online abuse, asked the platform owner for help, was promised assistance, and then the company took action. The Court ruled that section 230 did not apply to the case because it involved the failure of a service to follow through on its promise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How can online platforms improve child safety?">How can online platforms improve child safety?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's tempting to view Section 230 as an obstacle for holding online platforms accountable for user safety—but there's a larger patchwork of policy gaps that led to this complicated status quo. Law enforcement has been slow to act on all manner of online threats. The closed ecosystems or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Discord prevent other companies from offering third-party safety tools to parents.

"A general industry trend of scaling back moderation would be an abhorrent excuse for putting children in harm’s way," Walsh said to Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Other companies have successfully implemented common-sense safety mechanisms like ID age verification, &nbsp;mandatory parental approval by default, and robust deterrents to prevent messaging between children and adults.

            <p>
Right, has everyone got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> out of their system? I'm sure there's plenty of you that have scoured enough of its map to feel satisfied and ready for another hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>! A game that fits that bill precisely, albeit with its own, quite literally painterly flair, one which is out today.
</p>
<p>
Constance, as you may have gathered from looking at it, is the game's titular hero, one who wields a big ole paintbrush. To say this game is one that takes some cues from Celeste would probably also be apt, as Constance's main foe is, dun-dun-dun, herself. Or, well, her unconscious inner demons, that have imprisoned her within her own mind. These demons appear to manifest in a myriad of ways, such as evil robots, or sentient candles, or straight up bits of paper.
</p>
<p>
Those mental-health focused Celeste inspirations appear to translate to the game's movement puzzles a touch as well, as you do a lot of dashing around avoiding dangerous obstacles and the like. Of course platforming is a big element of many 2D metroidvanias, there's just an element of precise timing here that looks reminiscent of how Celeste functions.
</p>
<p>
I quite like the sound of the narrative framework around upgrades. This is a game about creativity, so you can find "inspirations" along the way to sketch in your journal, which then can improve Constance's abilities. There's just something quite nice, conceptually anyway, about the idea of going out into the world and taking in what it offers you to better yourself in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
It's cheap as chips too with a 10% launch discount, so as I said, if you're ready for a new metroidvania in your life, Constance is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">ready and waiting for you on Steam</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-margin-blind-with-the-m5-ipad-pro-as-black-friday-brings-an-unprecedented-drop-for-its-newly-released-tablet.1363039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking up the M5 iPad Pro for the first time should come with a wary bystander asking, “are you sure you can handle this thing,” as if you were sliding into the driver’s seat of an F1 race car. The amount of power under the hood of the newest iPad Pro is&nbsp;<em>that</em> significant, and with Black Friday week kicking off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Amazon is handing you the keys to the 13-inch version with a first-ever $100 price drop to $1,195.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, learning how to harness all of the crazy amount of power and features of the M5 iPad Pro won’t end with you pancaked into a wall. If anything, you won’t be able to put it down once you see just what the upgrade to the M5 chip — the very same one found in the newest MacBooks — has done for the iPad Pro. Everything from editing 4K video, precision art creation, and heavy-duty gaming is now firmly on the table.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Enough</h2>
<p>The best reviews on iPads or any tablets has always been that they’re “good enough” to take on visually challenging or work-intensive tasks normally done by laptops or desktops. The M5 iPad Pro isn’t merely “good enough” to be your primary device for streaming, photo editing, content creation, number-crunching, or anything else — it handles them all as easily as virtually any laptop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the M5 iPad Pro falls in line with pretty much every iPad ever made by having an industry-best display. The 13-inch screen is a Liquid Retina XDR thing of beauty, and it’s not going to lag or glitch out on you while you stream or edit videos or play an action game, thanks to the GPU built into the M5 chip.</p>
<p>Take a deeper dive into the Apple ecosystem by adding the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard folio (both sold separately) and you have a truly formidable touchscreen laptop, but one that runs the clean, silky-smooth iPadOS 26, updated with Liquid Glass design, helpful widgets and improved interaction with the Apple Pencil.</p>



<h2>Best iPad Ever?</h2>
<p>Need more power? Take Apple Intelligence out for a spin to help you create and execute pro-level workflows, and the iPad Pro’s Neural Accelerators will have them up and running in no time. Browsing or streaming speed? This iPad Pro can run Wi-Fi 7 with Apple’s brand-new N1 chip to deliver stunning online speed. The landscape 12MP front camera and 12MP rear camera are top notch, and when you combine them with the elite-level built-in mics and speakers, your FaceTime calls and videoconferencing will be the best ever delivered by any iPad. There’s also a USB-C port that lets you connect to an external Thunderbolt or USB 4 monitor.</p>
<p>Call it a race car, a thoroughbred, a rocket, or any other analogy you want, and the M5 iPad Pro lives up to it. Simply put, it’s Apple’s best and by&nbsp;<em>far</em> most powerful tablet yet, and it should be at the very top of the Black Friday list for anyone who wants it all when it comes to portable smart-device power. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Hit Amazon now and grab the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro while it’s at an all-time low price of $1,195.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-free-week-star-wars-fan-film-exodus-leaks-bf6-2000646871#:~:text=Battlefield%206%E2%80%B2,royale%20spin%2Doff."><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s conquest mode and some of its maps</a> will be free to play across all platforms. That means an influx of new players. So now seems like a good time to ask everyone, even the people already playing EA’s blockbuster online FPS, to please capture control points in Conquest. Please. I’m begging you.</p>

 <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em> since it launched in October</a>. And I’ve had a great time with it. The FPS is easily my favorite <em>Battlefield</em> in a few years and will likely be a game I return to a lot in 2026. But whenever I play Conquest, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Conquest">the franchise’s iconic mode</a> that’s been around since the OG <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, I get frustrated by how many players seem not to understand the point of the mode. That point being: Capture control points, hold and defend them, and if needed, take them back from the enemy. Hold more points, and your team will win faster. Let them control the battlefield, and you’ll lose just as quickly.</p>

 <p>Sounds simple enough, yet I’ve lost a Conquest match and skimmed the scoreboard afterward countless times, just to spot half or more of my team with zero captures.</p>  <p>Now, I understand that some people are sniping and aren’t capping points. Fine. And some are using tanks and aircraft to support the team and won’t have as many captures as some other players or me. I get that, too. My problem is that so many players who aren’t sniping or using tanks seem to just… not take control points.</p>

 <p>I’ve watched players run into the first control point at the start of a match and capture it, then just run around the next one, never going in to cap it or help their team hold it. These aren’t snipers either, but support or assault players. Other times, I see people run to an enemy base, help fight and clear it, and then leave when it’s neutralized but not fully capped. Or some players will cap a base and then never leave it.</p> <p>I don’t care if you only get three kills. I don’t care if you a dozen times. As long as you are helping our team cap points, push forward when it makes sense, and fall back when needed to defend, I’ll be happy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has become the premium brand in robot vacuums with their latest flagships such as <em>Qrevo CurvX</em>&nbsp;and <em>Saros 10R</em>&nbsp;crossing the $1,000 threshold even with Black Friday discounts. But here’s the thing: t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">he Roborock Q5 S10+ is currently sitting at an all-time low of $259 on Amazon, down from its original $549 price tag</a>, and it’s flying off the shelves. This model packs serious technology into a mid-range package – think <strong>10,000Pa suction power, a self-emptying station that holds 70 days worth of debris, and a sonic mopping system that scrubs 3,000 times per minute</strong>. The kind of deal that makes you wonder if someone in Roborock’s pricing department made a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Vacuum Cleaner</h2>
<p>First of all, the 10,000Pa suction power puts this vacuum in the <strong>same league as models costing twice as much</strong>. That level of suction pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, grabs crumbs from hardwood floor crevices, and handles the kind of everyday mess that accumulates a lot quicker than you’d like to admit. The HyperForce technology behind this suction isn’t just a marketing term: it’s the difference between a robot that pushes debris around and one that actually removes it.</p>
<p>The self-emptying station completely changes the way you interact with the vacuum. You are looking at a 2.7L dust bag, able to hold up to 70 days of dirt and debris, which essentially means that you can forget about emptying for over two months. This is where pet owners will appreciate it more than anyone because pet hair fills up the standard robot vacuum bins in a matter of days. The <strong>station will automatically empty the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll never need to deal with those pesky clouds of dust or tangled hair when manually emptying a bin.</p>



<p>The <strong>VibraRise 2.0 mopping system</strong> is where this vacuum starts to feel like a premium product. Dual-zone sonic vibration scrubs floors up to 3,000 times per minute, which is enough force to handle dried spills and stuck-on messes that regular robot mops just smear around. The mopping module automatically lifts 8mm when it detects carpet, so you’re not dealing with wet carpets or having to manually remove mop pads before running a cleaning cycle. You can adjust mopping intensity through the app depending on how dirty your floors are, giving you control without requiring manual intervention.</p>
<p>The smart carpet detection uses ultrasonic technology to identify when the vacuum moves onto carpet from hard floors. Detecting carpet, it lifts the mopping modules and automatically increases suction power for a deeper cleaning. This dual response ensures that the carpets get the aggressive cleaning they require while protecting them from water damage. It’s reliable enough that you can run cleaning cycles while away from home with no fear of returning to soaked rugs.</p>



<p>Navigation on this vacuum relies on PreciSense LiDAR technology which scans 360° to create detailed maps of your home. The system supports multi-level mapping, meaning if you have a two-story house, the vacuum remembers the layout of both floors and can plan efficient cleaning routes for each level. With ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance, structured light technology is used to detect objects in real time and navigate around them, meaning fewer situations where it gets stuck and more complete cleaning coverage without needing to pre-clean before the robot vacuum cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, this vacuum delivers technology that was reserved for $500+ models just a couple of years ago. Roborock’s reputation for build quality means you’re not sacrificing reliability to hit this price point, and the fact that it’s selling in huge volumes on Amazon suggests plenty of people have figured out this is an unusually good value.</p>

<p>The 2025 holiday shopping season is in full swing, and Nintendo is dropping a host of discounts to help players secure some last-minute deals and gifts.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to pull the trigger on a Nintendo Switch 2, are looking to add to your library of games, or are on the hunt for accessories, Nintendo has plenty of deals to cover all bases.</p>



<p>To help with your shopping spree, Insider Gaming has collected the best Nintendo Black Friday deals for 2025. Make sure to leave a comment if something catches your eye, and join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to share deals you’ve found with other players to take advantage of.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-do-the-nintendo-black-friday-deals-start">When Do The Nintendo Black Friday Deals Start?</h2>



<p>Nintendo’s holiday gift guide went live well in advance of Black Friday, on November 10, with the main Cyber Deals kicking off on November 20 and running through to December 3 at 11:59 PM PT.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-deals-for-black-friday-and-the-2025-holidays">Best Nintendo Deals For Black Friday and the 2025 Holidays</h2>



<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-console-deals">Nintendo Switch 2 Console Deals</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch 2 console has not received any fresh price drops directly from Nintendo for the holiday season, though you can still take advantage of the bundle deals with Mario Kart World &amp; Pokémon Legends: Z-A that save $20-30 compared to purchasing separately. However, retailers may offer additional incentives on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, though this is unlikely to be a price slash, and may instead include extra accessories or bundle deals.</p>







<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-accessories">Nintendo Switch Accessories</h3>



<p>Similar to the Switch 2 consoles, Nintendo hasn’t issued any direct deals for accessories for the original Switch and Switch 2, so the best course of action for savings on these will likely be heading to other retailers. However, even they are unlikely to drop prices significantly for Switch 2 accessories like Joy-Con controllers and the Camera. </p>

<p>If you’re looking to expand your games library on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 this holiday, the good news is that this is where you will find the majority of savings, particularly during the Cyber Deals event running until December 3. The table below outlines some of the best games and deals.</p>

Retailers love to hurl half-baked offers around in the run-up to what I like to call "Black Friday proper," the day after Thanksgiving. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are some genuinely good deals already available, it can still get a little tricky to work out what is actually worth your time, especially if you're on a limited budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where I'm here to help. Sure, there are plenty of strong 2025 releases on offer, with big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-best-games-already-on-sale-black-friday-2025">PS5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Nintendo Switch</a> titles in the mix, but the real gold right now is the slew of games sitting at 20 dollars or less at retailers like Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That slice of the sale is stacked with some genuine heavy hitters from across the current generation's almost five-year life cycle. If you want actual bargains, this is the bin worth digging through.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring</h2><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231670"><div id="231670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Horizon Forbidden West</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, slightly overshadowed by Elden Ring (sorry, Guerilla Games). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-review">Horizon Forbidden West</a> is another <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79775" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100-hour plus game</a> that is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-is-down-to-its-lowest-ever-price-at-amazon-ahead-of-black-friday">absolute bargain for $19.99 on PS5</a>.

Pick this up for 20 bucks, and never have to worry about your PS Plus sub lapsing if you want to replay it, or perhaps spend more than a month getting through it (which is likely, this one is <em>big). </em>If you can stretch to $30, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8dO3?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">complete edition is also on sale</a>, and includes the games entire DLC collection as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars Outlaws</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231671"><div id="231671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, here's one that might take a little more convicing.

Either way, grab all of these before the correction hits, because this will not last. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each figure launched at $29.99, so seeing them down to $9.99 means you're saving 66% and shaving $20 off every amiibo. That's even stronger than the midyear sale, when they bottomed out between $14.99 and $19.99 at Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you're wondering what they actually do in-game, all four of the Zelda figures unlock content in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Being part of the Zelda line also means they can unlock bonuses elsewhere. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening includes amiibo-exclusive Chamber Dungeons, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe gives you a new Mii racing suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Switch 2 with the upgrade pack, you're getting a much smoother ride. The update bumps up frame rate and resolution, cleaning up the original's only real flaw, its performance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">Tom Marks put it in his review update</a>, ”This [Switch 2 upgrade] really does feel like the way this game was always meant to be played, and I’m thrilled by the idea of a new generation discovering it for the first time.” Hard to disagree.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Switch 2 Black Friday Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

                <p>The muted response to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from critics and fans appears to have translated into lower sales for the futuristic first-person shooter, with the game reportedly falling behind competitors in a few regions. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> described Black Ops 7's European launch as "disappointing," citing <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GSD</a>, which tracks physical and digital sales data.</p><p>Sales numbers for Black Ops 7's opening week are 63% below those of Battlefield 6, and The Game Business also estimates that sales are over 50% down compared to last year's Black Ops 6. Even still, the GSD numbers indicate that Black Ops 7 was still the top-selling game in Europe during its opening week.</p>

      </div>
<p>Despite Japan not being a key market for the Call of Duty franchise, sales numbers there show a similar trend, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-launch-in-20-year-history/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> reporting that Black Ops 7 had the worst Japanese launch in the franchise's history.</p><p>This doesn't paint a complete picture of how Black Ops 7 is performing--the game is included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, so there is certainly a good chunk of the playerbase not reflected in these early reported numbers.</p><p>Even still, Activision--which is usually quick to publicly brag about record-breaking sales or player counts after launching a Call of Duty game--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">uncharacteristically quiet about numbers after Black Ops 7 shipped</a>.</p><p>Reception to Black Ops 7, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-aim-assist-changes-and-weapon-balancing-are-coming-in-season-1-update/1100-6536402/" data-ref-id="1100-6536402">starts its first season in December</a>, was relatively lukewarm, with criticisms levied toward in-game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">assets allegedly generated by AI</a> and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-pause-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-so-you-better-hold-it-in/1100-6536212/" data-ref-id="1100-6536212">always-online story campaign</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty also arguably has tougher competition this year, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 skyrocketing in best-seller lists</a> and extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">Arc Raiders lapping Black Ops 7</a> in Steam player counts.</p>
