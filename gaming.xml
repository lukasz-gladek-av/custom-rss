            <p>The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">an easygoing escape</a>. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sledding-game">Sledding Game</a> looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine. </p>

<p>You'll earn points while sledding down the mountain (at one point we see the sledder grind a rail) and then use these points to buy cosmetics like "hats, jackets, scarves, goggles" as well as stickers for your sled. You'll be able to make snowmen, get into snowball fights, and ride a ski lift back up the mountain when you inevitably wipe out on an unexpected slope. "Whether you're racing to the bottom or taking it slow, the hill is all about fun, friends, and freedom," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3438850/Sledding_Game/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game's creator, a solo developer professionally branded as "The Sledding Company", has been posting devlog videos on TikTok since December. They demonstrate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7459466030050479402">how players will get off the ski lift</a> and pay sorrowful tribute to an <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7458729542614584619">endless field of frog corpses</a>. "My main inspiration is mainly from Webfishing, which I guess is inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>," said the dev in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7450006703212350766">the video announcing the game</a>, before asking for suggestions from viewers. "I don't really know where to go with this project, I just think it's a fun little game-slash-playground-thing." </p><p>The creator also has plans to add 100-player lobbies with proximity voice chat and text chat, which seems a tad ambitious for a small-scale messabout like this. Not to mention a surefire way to emperil the "cozy" and low-key vibe the game seems to be aiming at. Webfishing has 12-player lobbies, for example, and already has to contend with the spectrum of online (mis)behaviour that comes with chat rooms. Even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, a more chaotic party game about going downhill in the snow, taps out at 40 players (and it limits player chitchat to emotes). Although the Sledding Company does add that the 100-player plan is not set in stone, saying: "until further testing, this will just be a guess".</p>
<p>However it turns out, I like when devs show their work like this. I know it can simply be a good marketing strategy for smaller studios and lone developers (people like to watch funny videos on apps that annoy the United States government, it turns out) but ragdolls are always appreciated. And watching developers run headfirst into bugs is doubtless reassuring for fellow struggling game designers otherwise doomscrolling into the abyss. </p>
<p>Sledding Game doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll keep an eye on these penguins for you. It looks like they require supervision anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Competitive ITV show Hell's Kitchen is now blowing up as an experience in Roblox, with a cartoony version of Gordon Ramsay at the fore.</p>
<p>Since its debut last month, ITV's first-ever Roblox experience has had over 20m visits from aspiring chefs, and boasts 450k daily active users happy to have the show's celebrity chef express disdain at their dishes.</p>
<p>As with Hell's Kitchen on telly, those who participate in the official Roblox experience will be popped onto either the Red or the Blue team. And, while I haven't seen word that Ramsay will call users an "Idiot Sandwich", his Roblox counterpart still shares his disappointment if food isn't up to snuff.</p>

            <p>
Origin, EA's universally-disliked PC storefront and launcher launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reveals-steam-rival-origin">back in 2011</a>, will finally shut down this year, on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, long since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-ditching-origin-brand-with-new-ea-desktop-app-as-part-of-ongoing-rebranding-efforts">replaced Origin with the EA App</a>, which isn't much better. 
</p>
<p>
From mid-April, any PC users still using Origin will need to switch in order to continue accessing their library of games and gameplay data.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/">statement</a> on EA's support website, the publisher states that it is finally killing off Origin as "Microsoft has stopped supporting 32-bit software". 
</p>
<p>
"If you use Origin, you need to upgrade to the EA app, which requires a 64-bit version of Windows," EA notes.
</p>
<p>
If you have a relatively new PC with a 64-bit version of Windows, downloading the EA App now and ensuring your game saves are ported over is probably a good idea. 
</p>
<p>
Cloud saves should carry across automatically, though games without cloud support will need manual save migration. 
</p>
<p>
Don't have a 64-bit PC? Then it's bad news. "To run a 64-bit version of Windows, make sure your PC has a 64-bit-capable processor," EA helpfully states. "If your PC doesn’t have one, you'll need to use a newer computer to play your games on the EA app."
</p>
<p>
EA typically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-ea-is-returning-to-steam">also now launches its PC games on Steam</a>, of course, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/</link>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will not be a massive problem for ports and multiplatform games, as additional optimization work will get these games running decently on the system.</p>
<p>Famiiboards user MattAgain, who is a known developer who has worked in the video game industry for a long time and provided some valuable insights in the past, recently <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the newly revealed system, highlighting how the Switch 2 CPU, while being the part that deviates the most from the standard set by the system overall, is not going to be cause of concern for developers, as no one making a Switch 2 game from the ground up is complaining about it. The only small complaints have come from developers working on ports, which will apparently require a bit more CPU optimization work, compared to how relatively easily graphical resources can scale to the GPU. This additional CPU optimization work, however, isn't anything that shouldn't be expected, going from a power-hungry x86 to a mobile ARM CPU. So, for the time being, the system's CPU shouldn't be an impediment, and, as a whole, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting</a> a PlayStation 5 game to the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be much easier than porting a PlayStation 4 game to the original Switch, which is great news.</p>
<p>The fact that porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2 should be easier than porting games to its predecessor is definitely great news, as this should allow third-party developers to support the system with ease. Very few games have been confirmed for the new Nintendo consoles, but according to rumors, plenty of big publishers are looking into supporting the console heavily, such as Microsoft, who is reportedly working on ports of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">Diablo IV, Fallout 4 and even Starfield</a>. According to a recent report, basically, every third-party developer is considering supporting the system with their most ambitious AAA titles.</p>

            <p>Steam are throwing a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy_real_time">Real-Time Strategy Fest</a> this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">Creeper World 4</a> were a bit more like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ground-control-game">Ground Control</a>.

<p>The premise: you are the sole surviving crew member aboard an Avaris Corporation deep-space mining vessel. After a century in cryosleep, you're woken by the shipboard AI and unceremoniously bundled off to the surface of a lifeless planet in search of ore. Then you discover that the planet ain't so lifeless.</p>
<p>The basic flow here is a mixture of tower-defencey base-building and surgical incursions upon a decentralised, enveloping threat that steadily and insidiously paints the map its colour. You'll need to set up turrets and a robust power grid to keep them online. But you'll also need to build tanks, artillery and so forth so that you can clear distant canyons of invasive plants before they become a problem. There are different kinds of plants, which correspond in some ways to the unit types of a traditional RTS, but the thrill of Calyx, I think, is pitting a regular strategy game toolset against a foe that doesn't play by the same rules.</p><p>The demo includes a tutorial level and "an alpha quality, mid-game level to show how the final experience might feel". Creators Studio 568 <a href="https://www.studio568.co.uk/about">were founded</a> by three, pretty seasoned developers with credits at Epic Games, Lionhead and Natural Motion.

<p>NCSoft’s Horizon MMO, codenamed Project H, has reportedly been canceled.</p>



<p>That’s according to the South Korean website <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>), who say that at least three projects at NCSoft had been canceled, including Project Pantera, Project H, and Project J. According to widespread rumors, Project H was the codename of the Horizon MMO, which would be later called Skyline.</p>



<p>According to the report, both Project J and Project H were canceled at the beginning of the year, with its developers being notified that they’d been moving to different teams across the company.</p>



<p>In late 2023, NCSoft announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-and-ncsoft-global-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global business partnership with Sony</a>, spearheaded by SIE’s Jim Ryan and NCSOFT’s Taekjin Kim. </p>



<p>The Horizon MMO shouldn’t be confused with Horizon Online, another Horizon project in development at Guerrilla Games, which is forecasting up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-games-1-million-players-horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million players on the title</a>. The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>&nbsp;in 2022 as a “online project set in the Horizon universe.” A recent job listing suggests that the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Project H’s cancellation marks the third project this month reportedly canceled. Last week, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two live-service games were canceled</a>, one at Bend Studio and the other at Bluepoint. According to the report, Bluepoint’s game was a live-service God of War game.</p>

			<p>The Horizon MMO that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">reportedly</a> in the works by Korean development studio NCSoft may have been canceled alongside other projects, according to a new report that's been making the rounds.</p>
<p>Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTN</a> shared an exclusive report last week, as posted on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA</a>, which confirms how some of the studio's projects, which include Project H, the Horizon MMO, have stopped development following a feasibility review. Developers assigned to these projects, according to MTN, were notified about the end of development and to prepare for internal transfers late last year and at the beginning of 2025. Some of these canceled projects have also disappeared from the company's organizational charts, so it definitely looks like development has been terminated for good.</p>
<p>As the Horizon MMO was never formally announced, it is unlikely that an announcement will be made regarding the end of development. Still, this is definitely not a good look for Sony right now, whose push into live service games seems to have only brought disastrous results, with the failed launch of Concord last year and the recent cancelation of two other games in development by Bluepoint Games, who was developing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War live service game</a>, and Bend Studio. The Horizon multiplayer game, whose first look came with some leaked footage back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">2023</a>, on the other hand, is still in development, so Sony is still going ahead with expanding the franchise beyond the single-player boundaries set by the first two main entries in the series.</p>

            <p>An MMO based on Sony's Horizon IP has reportedly been cancelled.</p>
<p>We first got wind of a Horizon MMO in 2022, when a report stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">project was in the works at Guild Wars' NCSoft</a>. At this time, a source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft said the two companies had "tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which [NCsoft] will create new games using Sony's promising game IP".</p>
<p>A year later in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-report-of-horizon-mmo-ncsoft-and-sony-announce-strategic-partnership">Sony and NCsoft publicly announced a strategic partnership</a>, designed to "expand beyond console and broaden PlayStation's reach to a wider audience". While neither company referenced Horizon as part of the announcement, it was widely believed the series was a key part of the collaboration.</p>

<p>Since then we've heard little more, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmorpg-is-now-essentially-confirmed-to-be-in-development-job-listing-suggests">job listings shared in 2023 which appeared to confirm the Horizon MMO was in development</a> with the codename Project Skyline (with the initial codename being Project H).

"Among them, 'H' and 'J' have already disappeared from the company's organisational chart," reads a translation of the report.</p>
<p>The Horizon MMO was reportedly set for a release on PC and mobile. Eurogamer has reached out to NCSoft and Sony with regards to today's report.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has become the latest company to pull its advertising from a major Japanese broadcaster, after reports of a sex scandal involving the former frontman of a popular boyband and a female employee.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> maker is currently in the midst of an advertising campaign for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and had been subject to calls from fans to join a growing boycott of the high-profile Tokyo-based Fuji Television, <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF214EX0R20C25A1000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&amp;n_tw=1737435375">Nikkei</a> reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-suspends-commercials-on-major-japanese-tv-network-amidst-sex-scandal/">Automaton</a>).
</p>
<p>
Fuji TV has been accused of setting up a June 2023 meeting under false pretenses between an unnamed female employee and Masahiro Nakai, a prominent actor and former lead of boyband SMAP. 
</p>

<p>
It is alleged that Fuji TV falsely told its employee that she would meet Nakai at a company dinner alongside other attendees. In reality, the female presenter found herself meeting Nakai alone, and she was sexually assaulted.
</p>
<p>
According to Japanese newspaper reports, Nakai subsequently paid the woman 90m yen (around £470k) in an out of court settlement, which became public knowledge last month. Nakai has since issued an acknowledgement of "shortcomings".
</p>
<p>
For its part, Fuji TV has denied it deliberately set up the meeting, and begun an internal investigation to address concerns of a culture where male celebrities were given access to its female employees.
</p>
<p>
The channel will now replace regular TV advertising with public service announcements from non-profit organisations.

Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I guess chopping off horns and tails in the preceding fight counts as "butchery", but this process is quite stagey too, somewhat scripted, a little bit... canned. Ugh, I am getting lost in the permutations. I no longer know how to make this metaphor work. Like a hunter fleeing a Rathalos that was actually only <em>playing</em> dead, I must make a terrified leap to the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via Capcom's <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">German Xitter account</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements">Eurogamer</a>, who note that Monster Hunter Wilds' existing PC system specs have "raised a few eyebrows" - especially given the last beta's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buggy-monsters-in-monster-hunter-wilds-have-sparked-a-wave-of-low-poly-animal-adoration">slight tendency to make the monsters look like angry Dali paintings</a>. Capcom say they're focussing on the game's recommended GPU requirements, while also trying to improve performance. Here's a screenshot of the current PC specs from Steam, for context.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PC-system-specs-21st-Jan-2025.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Seeking guidance from the gods, I ran those specs by our hardware editor James. Our remote-working format made it impossible to ascertain whether his eyebrows were raised, but he didn't seem to think the requirements were excessive. He did suggest that 140GB was quite a lot of SSD space, and that the recommended specs only allowing for 60 FPS with frame generation is a bit weird. And that the minimum GPU requirement is on the beefy side. Me, I'm still goggling at 16GB of RAM. I hear this is pretty standard nowadays, for a game with all three "A"s, but in my head, 8GB is still the norm for minimum spec.
</p><p>
I'm interested to know what you all think should be the minimum and recommended specs for a game of Monster Hunter Wilds stature right now. Both in terms of your own setups, and more abstractly in terms of what you consider a fair price for all those frames and pixels. Come, let us explore this vexing question as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">parable</a> about the blind men feeling their way around the elephant, trying to ascertain its complete form. Wait a minute, this elephant has wings. It's that bloody Rathalos again.

			<p>While the cosy genre for some might mean a spot of farming or a touch of interior design, it’s tower defence that remains my calm, happy place. I’m not sure what that says about me, but it’s fair to say that IDUN – Frontline Survival puts you in that zen zone of constant watchfulness, laying down destructive towers while the hideous alien hordes attempt to overrun your defences. Ahhh, so cosy.</p>
<p><iframe title="IDUN: Frontline Survival - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2eea98br6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play Security Officer Ham, who’s literally having a nap on the job when you’re introduced to him. This is the only rest he’s getting though, with a grotesquely rude awakening when vermin start to attack your mining post. You have to rely on your trusty flamethrower turret and Ham’s shotgun to make it out alive. There’s a cool sci-fi story running through IDUN’s tower-centric action, presented with great-looking character art to back it up.</p>


<p>The narrative drive helps to get you dug in with IDUN’s different mechanics, from controlling multiple hero characters, alongside moving and shifting your towers to deal with threats in the moment. As with the best tower defence games, IDUN forces you to face huge swarms of incoming enemies and hold them off, and it’s a lot of fun doing so.</p>


<p>The thing is, this isn’t so much a tower defence game as it is an RTS defence game. It merrily skewers the two genres together, and if you’re a fan of either it’s a winning combination that takes very little time to get you hooked. You move your towers and heroes as you need them, and it maintains a frantic pace that isn’t often found in the defence genre.</p>
<p>The only downside to moving your towers around is that you potentially lose some of the strategy and decision-making that you do when placing things permanently. In return though, I really like the addition of hero characters that you can use to plug gaps and turn the tide in your favour, and the increased pace lends IDUN – Frontline Survival its own feel.</p>
<p>There’s resource collection to think of too, and it’s often like spinning a very angry plate, balancing the need to control resource nodes while protecting your drilling equipment and base. Collecting enough resources unlocks upgrades mid-mission, from extra towers to permanent upgrades. This gives you a constant flow of improvements and decisions to make, and you have to hope that you’re making the right one to deal with the incoming threats.</p>

<p>Things can become a little too hectic at times, and there were moments where I lost my hero characters amongst the writhing enemy hordes. That said, it’s so enjoyable, that you can look past the occasional foible. You can call down additional artillery fire to give you a boost when things are looking desperate, and you’ll probably find yourself using it every single chance you can.</p>
<p>IDUN – Frontline Survival is no joke, pushing you to the limit in terms of enemy numbers and resources. On Medium difficulty you’ll be up against it by the third level, but in turn it feels really well balanced, and victory is hard won and rewarding.</p>

<p>You can upgrade your crew using resources won through successfully completing missions, increasing their health, range, fire rate and more. In addition to that, there’s a vast number of different turrets and additional weaponry you can install from your space station, keeping things interesting as you progress, and hopefully helping you through to the other side.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		IDUN – Frontline Survival is an RTS/Tower Defence hybrid that sells the concept incredibly well. While there’s a few rough edges, if you’re a fan of either genre, it’s an edge-of-the-seat blast. 	</p></div>

			<p>There are some major strategy and simulation games that will be released this year, including the eagerly-awaited release of Civilization VII. If you're looking for a new strategy or simulation game, you'll want to keep your eyes on some of the titles on this list that are set to be released later this year. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five most anticipated strategy and simulation games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Civilization VII (February 11, 2025)</h2>
<p>The year is starting off really strong with <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> from Firaxis. For some, it may feel like Civilization VI was released just a couple of years ago, but it was actually launched in 2016. Now, we are seeing a new era of Civ, with the latest game in the franchise set to be released on February 11, 2025. This game will be widely available, with those on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even Nintendo Switch able to get it in the future. For those who have pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition or the Founder's Edition, you'll get access to this title a full five days before the full release of the game, getting an advantage over those who will be waiting for the official release date, especially if you plan to play against them in multiplayer. You can check out the official PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-system-requirements-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Two Point Museum (February 27, 2025)</h2>
<p>The Two Point franchise has had some fantastic games, including Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The latest iteration in the franchise allows you to become a museum owner, and is set to be the most ambitious in the franchise. For those who enjoyed the previous games in the franchise, you'll definitely want to keep your eye on this one. Especially if you've had dreams of owning your own museum, this will allow you to do just that. Two Point Museum is set to release on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Football Manager 25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>If playing the actual game of football doesn't do it for you, but you enjoy the management of creating your own teams and having them compete, Football Manager is the way to go. The game was originally set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/">release last year</a> as usual, being an annual series, but has since been delayed by the developers, with the game now set to release sometime in March. For those interested, Football Manager 25 will be released on most systems, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alliance of the Sacred Suns (2025)</h2>
<p>If you enjoy a 4X Strategy game set in space, then you'll want to keep your eyes peeled on Alliance of the Sacred Suns. It begins with your coronation as the new head of an empire, with the game ending when you die. Between the start and the end, you have a lot of major choices to make to ensure the survival of yourself as well as your empire. There are feuding houses, attempts at usurping the throne, and much more to keep you on your toes. At the moment, this game doesn't have a set release date but is due to come out later in 2025.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Commandos: Origins (March 2025)</h2>
<p>Commandos: Origins is that perfect hit of nostalgia that is set to be released later this year. This game is a long-awaited sequel in the Commandos franchise, a series that hasn't received a new release since 2006. There have been HD remasters of some of the classics in 2022, but this is a brand-new story that takes you back to the start of the elite force, where you get to experience their origin stories for the first time. It's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in March; meanwhile, you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-demo-released-for-pc-and-xbox-series-sx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> check out a demo</a> (available only on PC and Xbox).</p>

            <p>One piece of worldbuilding advice I've always found useful is to go at least one level deeper than the obvious. To wit: why have a lantern, asks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mohrta">Mohrta</a>, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Steam demo</a>. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.</p>

<p>It's a world of stumpy, cowbell-wearing pet giraffes and ferocious avian nightmare bastards. These aren't things I'm used to dealing with on daily basis, so I naturally sought something to ground myself. Luckily, you start with a very nice, comfortingly chunky pistol with an excellent alt fire that unloads a full clip at whatever you're pointing at. Your sword also has an alt fire, as all good swords should. These use mana, which you can restore with a big sippy from your flask. And so you progress. Looking at things and going "oh yeah, that's cool", shooting very fast things that want you dead, and taking big sippies.</p>
<p>Between the vaguely futuristic modern and medieval bits, and the very strange horse your character rides, my mind naturally went straight to Wolfe's Book Of The New Sun. This is likely more recency bias than anything else, but there's definitely a sense of thick, somewhat pulpy history to the world, and I'm very curious to find out more about it. What's interesting is how the lore blurb would fit equally well for a modern military shooter, albeit one with a few supernatural elements:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A special military group known as "The Hayward" was formed to investigate and destroy the anomalies within The Strange. For years, the Hayward had done an admirable job of monitoring, handling, and reverse-engineering elements of the Great Strange into their work. Among these Hayward operatives is where your remains found new life."</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll often hear people say "graphics don't matter", but rarely the same about features. I must then conclude that most people care about features. As such, here are Mohrta's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adventure through an atypical take on the FPS genre.</li>
<li>Play through the game's five enormous and differently-themed dimensions in any order you choose.</li>
<li>Soak in the otherworldly atmosphere and lovingly-crafted level design.</li>
<li>Fight though a myriad of highly-detailed environments that push the limits of GZDoom.</li>
<li>Explore unusual settings, characters, and enemies fleshed out in beautiful signature Scumhead detail, featuring designs by Osiol.</li>
<li>Acquire a huge roster of weapons, each with multiple functions and utility.</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapons and gear, and choose a custom loadout that best suits your playstyle.</li>
<li>Over 50 diverse enemies and 20 challenging boss fights to dodge, shoot, and strike through.</li>
<li>Befriend a huge cast of strange and loveable NPCs, each with their own quests and storylines.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This one's out sometime this year. It's from Oisol and Scumhead, who did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-like-short-steampunk-snes-style-rpgs-give-dystopian-freebie-franzen-a-shot">Franzen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online, following its unexpected ban in the US.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">digital collectible card game was banned in the US alongside TikTok</a>, due to its publisher Nuverse being owned by TikTok owner ByteDance.</p>
<p>At this time, developer Second Dinner said the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the Marvel Snap team as it was to players, too. It went on to state it would do everything it could to get the game back up and running as quickly as possible. Second Dinner has now achieved this, and Marvel Snap is back online in the US.</p>

</figure>
<p>The developer is now "working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher" to ensure this kind of surprise ban does not happen again.</p>
<p>Calling this move the "start of a new era" for the card game, the Marvel Snap team acknowledged players may have "more questions than answers". However, it assured its followers on social media that it would keep them updated with more details on the matter "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>There are still some remaining issues following Marvel Snap's suspension. Replying to users on X, Second Dinner said it is still working on restoring the game's App Store availability, adding this "may take some time".</p>
<p>It additionally noted "in-app purchases remain unavailable but the team is working on it". In the meantime, it said web shop purchases are all in working order, so players can go there for now.</p>

<p>Following its release, Marvel Snap won itself scores of fans, including many on the Eurogamer team. It was soon nominated for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sweeps-bafta-nominations">number of awards at prestigious events including the BAFTAs</a>.</p>
<p>Our Donlan was especially taken with Marvel Snap on its debut, praising the game for giving him some welcome moments to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>"Whenever I lose a game - and I lose all the time - I get to spend a pleasant few moments working out what went wrong, picking over my deck, and swapping cards in and out. There's a reward for being bad at the game. How kind," he wrote in his feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2022-marvel-snap-offered-the-best-moments-of-reflection">Games of 2022: Marvel Snap offered the best moments of reflection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss has responded to Donkey Kong's redesign seen in the Mario Kart segment of the Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>As fans quickly spotted, the gorilla has received a bit of a redesign for the next karting game. He now looks closer to his film design and the retro design by Shigehisa Nakaue, with a cuter looking face.</p>
<p>Bayliss, who redesigned Donkey Kong for the SNES game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, responded to a fan video spoofing the new look.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-is-coming-this-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this year's London Toy Fair, Ravensburger and The Walt Disney Company announced a new set of cards for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. The latest set for the popular card game, <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>, will introduce more beloved characters for collectors and players alike.</p>

<h2>The Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger showcased some card and product artwork for <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=NhG-0Zti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=cNIMY_dm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these are the booster boxes. The artwork shows Encanto's Mirabelle, Bolt sporting a steampunk-esque leg attachment, Belle from Beauty and the Beast stepping into her father's footsteps with an engineer's outfit and an electric tool, The Mad Hatter brewing some tea, and Iago with his brazen scowl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-product-artwork.jpg?itok=NG63Wdkr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-product-artwork.jpg?itok=fHPoWoUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A more robust <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em> image shows not just starter decks, but game mats and card sleeves. The card sleeves sport both Cinderella and Ursula. One game mat features Tigger in a pirate outfit covered in rope high in a crow's nest. The other features the superhero team, Big Hero 6, in full costume.</p>

<p>As for the starter decks, they are appropriately on theme. The first shows Belle and The Beast and appears to be a Ruby and Sapphire deck. The Beast is more dapper than normal, sporting a glowing quill and even a monocle. I suppose Belle has rubbed off on him in the best way. The second starter deck sports Iago and Jafar and is an Amethyst and Steel deck.</p>

<p>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island will be released in March 2025. <em>Reign of Jafar</em> will be released on June 6, 2025, with pre-release events happening on May 30, 2025. <em>Fabled</em> will be released sometime in Q3 of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, introducing the world to one of the best RPGs slated for 2025. On social media and across the internet, gamers have been abuzz about the impending release, causing all manner of questions to surface about the open-world RPG.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m addressing one of those questions: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a sequel?’ That ‘2’ might be a bit of a giveaway, but let’s dive into the topic below and answer that question in full.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-set-after-kingdom-come">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Set After Kingdom Come?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a direct sequel to the first game. It’s set mere months after the ending of the first game, which was released in 2018. In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players assume control of Henry of Skalitz once again, slotting them into a very familiar perspective, provided they’ve played Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>KCD2 is as instant a follow-up game as you could ever hope to play. Many themes from the first game roll over into the second title, and it’s as though you’re picking the story up right where you left it at the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>That means you’ll recognise returning characters, and understand various plots and quests, and you’ll also be familiar with many of the game’s mechanics, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking</a> or making potions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Saviour Schnapps</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-first">Do You Need to Play Kingdom Come First?</h2>



<p>In 2018, Kingdom Come Deliverance was released to a popular enough reception, despite being a relatively gruelling and realistic game that punished average gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>This story-rich, open-world game turned heads because it was so immersive and such a faithful representation of the setting, leaning on real people, places, and events to enrich the game.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s not <strong>necessary </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play the first Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This is because the developer, Warhorse Studios, has done a remarkable job with the writing of the second game, working in flashback sequences, conversations that dive into the first game’s history, and nods to the story of the opening title.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), you should be fine starting with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>That being said, the first game is stellar, and it shouldn’t be missed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Am a Living God of Video Games’: Elon Musk Has Admitted He Cheated in Diablo and PoE]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98i-am-a-living-god-of-video-games%E2%80%99-elon-musk-has-admitted-he-cheated-in-diablo-and-poe.1087458/</guid>

<p>If you’re an avid social media user, you might have heard the debate recently regarding the ‘legitimacy’ of Elon Musk’s gaming successes. In recent weeks, claims from the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire surfaced, suggesting that he’s one of the top-ranked players in both games – and he appeared to have the numbers to back those claims up.</p>



<p>However, his bold claims attracted the attention of content creators familiar with the games he plays, and the holes in his story started to show quite quickly. In a follow-up conversation with a YouTuber named NikoWrex, Elon Musk admitted that he cheated in both games to get to where he is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dishonest-conduct">Dishonest Conduct</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that Elon Musk is an avid gamer. In the summer of 2023, Musk appeared in a live chat on Twitter (which was still <strong>named </strong>Twitter back then) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started talking about his obsession</a> with Diablo 4, which had just been released at the time.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, he became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most instantly successful streamers</a>, broadcasting his Diablo 4 gameplay to a concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>1.3 million </strong>users. That act alone marked him as one of the most-watched streamers in history.</p>



<p>Since then, Musk’s gaming habits have been relatively public, and weeks ago, the topic of him being a ‘top 20 player’ in Diablo 4 surfaced once again. He was quickly investigated and called out by streamers like Asmongold, who promptly fell into a social media beef with the tech billionaire and close friend of President Trump.</p>



<p>Now, in a series of DMs exchanged between Elon Musk and NikoWrex, it has been confirmed that all this time, Elon Musk was cheating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-elon-musk-cheating">How Was Elon Musk Cheating?</h2>



<p>A bunch of screenshots have surfaced online showcasing the full conversation between Elon Musk and NikoWrex (thanks, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102692/elon-musk-confirms-he-cheated-to-become-top-player-in-path-of-exile-2-and-diablo-iv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>). In these screenshots, Musk admits that ‘it’s impossible to beat the players in Asia’ if you’re not <strong>sharing your account </strong>with other users.</p>



<p>Account sharing is a prohibited action under the terms of service for many online games, and if it isn’t, it’s a morally corrupt concept. It’s exactly what it sounds like – you share the details of your account with other users who play when you’re busy, sleeping, working, or something like that.</p>



<p>Musk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk does insist that he’s still a cracked gamer, though:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how you cut it, a sub 2 min clear of the hardest level in Diablo is very fast. My run is posted to X. Very few mistakes were made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the discourse, Elon Musk’s ex-wife took to social media to defend him, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first american druid in diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA.</p>



<p>He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However you think of his exploits in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile, it seems that Elon Musk is a talented gamer. </p>



<p>Do you think his actions are reprehensible, or should everyone chill on Elon Musk? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shroud-might-start-a-marvel-rivals-esports-org-because-he-loves-the-game.1087278/</guid>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to turn heads since being released in December 2024. It has been a smash hit with tens of millions of players worldwide, which is aided by the fact that it’s a genuinely enjoyable, free-to-play hero shooter. NetEase is working hard to ensure the content pipeline remains stoked, and creators are locked in on the game.</p>



<p>One such creator is Shroud, one of the biggest streamers in the business. Recently, the former CSGO pro player gushed over Marvel Rivals and suggested he could be about to make an esports organisation focused exclusively on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-jest-or-not">In Jest or Not</h2>



<p>Whether he was being serious or not remains to be seen, but if anyone can do it, Shroud can.</p>



<p>For years, Shroud has been one of the most popular streamers in the world, coming out of a relatively successful esports pro player career and opting to sit in front of the camera for years to follow. Today, he’s one of the biggest names in gaming.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Shroud once again delved into his love for Marvel Rivals, explaining a potential goal for the near future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If we raise a certain amount of money, I’ll make a Marvel Rivals team, slash org.</p>



<p>This game might just be it.</p>



<p>I might have to set a donation goal, for this number to hit something, and <strong>I will make an org</strong> for Marvel Rivals only.</p>



<p>I might be playing this game for the rest of my life. I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<div><article><p><span>Shroud says he might make an org just so he can have a Marvel Rivals team 

“This game might just be it…I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life”</span></p></article></div>







<p>Marvel Rivals boasts a solid foundation that would easily support a competitive ecosystem. For now, it’s tied almost exclusively to a ranked platform, but recently, Twitch Rivals hosted a <strong>Marvel Rivals </strong>tournament, which was more or less a first for the game.</p>



<p>In the past, Shroud has dominated the likes of Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and VALORANT, so edging into the Marvel Rivals space is nothing but familiar territory.</p>

<p>The VALORANT rivalry between North American teams Sentinels and 100 Thieves has always been hot, but it reached unhinged levels just one week into the 2025 season. After some spicy photos hit the timeline this past weekend though, the two organizations asked their outspoken stars to tone it down.</p>



<p>Still, those photos will be seared into our memory for some time.</p>

<p>Prior to the highly anticipated match between Sentinels and 100 Thieves at VCT Americas, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100t-valorants-boostio-says-nrg-cant-win-championships-with-fns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100T’s sparkplug in-game leader Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</a> posted a wild couple of photos on X. This included one of someone bent over in front of him wearing Sentinels’ Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro’s jersey, with the caption “Banging @Sentinels today.”</p>



<p>However, it was Sentinels that got the last laugh, defeating 100 Thieves in three maps and knocking them down to the lower bracket of the VCT Americas Kickoff event. After the match, Boostio willingly posed in a similar bent-over position for Zellsis, who posted the image onto his Twitter account.</p>



<p>Eventually, both images were taken down, causing some on reddit to speculate that Riot forced the players to delete the photos. Some even claimed that both Zellsis and Boostio were fined for their tweets, but the Sentinels star has denied that speculation.</p>



<p>On X, Zellsis <a href="https://x.com/Zellsis/status/1881173481553101274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> “the internet [is] spreading misinformation as usual. I was not fined for that tweet, nor do I think Boostio was. The tweets were definitely out of pocket so Riot and our orgs politely requested we take them down.” Zellsis previously was fined by Riot Games back in 2023 for making a lewd gesture while on camera.</p>



<p>Should Zellsis and Boostio have received fines for their photos? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Excitement continues to mount ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' release next month, but if there's one big question mark around the whole thing, it's just what sort of performance improvements Capcom has been cooking up since its rather wobby public beta. And the publisher has now given a brief update on performance, alongside confirmation it's "looking into" lowering the game's recommended GPU requirements on PC.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' first public beta went live last October, and it immediately became clear there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">still work to be done</a> on the performance front. Players soon took to the internet highlighting everything from erratic framerates, even on decently beefy PCs, to unfortunate visual glitches making the whole thing look like Capcom's lead platform was the N64.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the publisher moved to remind players Monster Hunter Wilds was "still in development", offering assurances the full game was "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test", and that it was "committed to ensuring the quality of the final product." There was hope among fans some of these improvements might be evident in Monster Hunter Wilds' second open beta, scheduled to run from 7th-9th February, but Capcom recently confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">that wouldn't be the case</a>.

<p>
The company has, though, now provided a short update on performance, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">official German social media channel</a> recently posting (as per Google translate) that the team "has been addressing rendering issues from the open beta test and is continually working on improvements for launch". These assurances were accompanied by a video offering what Capcom called a "look at our updated Prioritise Performance more for PS5", albeit not a particularly illuminating one given the less-than-stellar quality of X's video player. Prioritise Performance mode (AKA Prioritise Framerate) targets up to 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X, compared to 30fps when using Prioritise Graphics mode.
</p><p>
Capcom also noted it's aiming to improve PC performance in a "similar way", and that it's additionally "looking into whether we can lower the recommended GPU requirements". The publisher raised a few eyebrows last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">revealed</a> Monster Hunter Wilds would require an RTX 2070 Super/RTX 4060/RX 6700XT to reach 60fps (with Frame Generation) at 1080p, so word there may be improvements here - particularly given the open beta's erratic performance on mid-range hardware - is encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 28th February, and the Character Creation, Story Trial and Slay Doshaguma Quest seen in last year's first open beta will all be available again when beta #2 kicks off earlier in the month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was quite taken with Monster Hunter Wilds' "familiar thrill of the hunt, player customisation, and extravagant combat" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">went hands-on in August</a>, so hopefully Capcom can iron our those remaining wrinkles before launch.

			<p>In a new report, NACON has announced their accessories that have been created with the Nintendo Switch 2 in mind. Just last week, people finally got their first look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2</a>. While it didn't reveal many details, it has been confirmed that people will get more information about the upcoming console in April thanks to a special Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console. NACON is a French publisher and accessory creator and has confirmed that it already has a bunch of peripherals for gamers to purchase when the Nintendo Switch 2 officially releases.</p>
<p>While we don't know the official release date yet of the console, NACON is expecting a significant rise in sales in the first half of the fiscal year of 2025/26, as that is when they are expecting the official release of the Nintendo Switch successor. In the report, they have also confirmed that they have a number of games ready to be published for the Nintendo Switch 2. This information comes from a snippet of the <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1881421491285393857/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report posted on X by MauroNL</a>, which you can read for yourself on their social media.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can see the line-up of accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 on the official NACON website, where you can see everything from foldable driving wheels to carrying cases and tempered glass protectors. So far, there are 16 items listed on the website, all for very reasonable prices. While they can't be purchased yet, they will be open to purchase as soon as the Switch 2 releases.</p>
<p>It's likely that once the console releases, NACON will continue to make even more products for the console, including themed accessories such as Mario and Zelda-themed items.</p>
<p>In the snippet of the report posted by MauroNL, NACON says that their business levels will be boosted thanks to the games and accessories that were created in 2024/25 but weren't released in that period and will instead be released in 2025/26. There will also be a NACON Connect Event taking place on March 6, where they will be showcasing some of the games that they have planned for this year. According to the post, they have 10 new games ready to be published, which will all be released at different points throughout the year. The most significant games out of the bunch will be revealed during their special event on March 6.</p>

		<p>I don't know how much we'll be talking about new games on Remap Radio this week, so if you, like me, are looking for something to pluck at while waiting for next month's avalanche of big games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671230/BLADE_CHIMERA/?ref=remapradio.com">I can highly recommend <em>Blade Chimera</em>. </a>Imagine a <em>Symphony of the Night</em>-style game with sick guns, cool swords, and the pixel aesthetic of a 90s arcade game. The hours I've spent with <em>Blade Chimera </em>have been "sick." Good stuff. Also good stuff: The Chicago Fucking Bears hiring Ben Fucking Johnson as their head coach. The Bears are (once again) back!!!!</p><p>-pk, who did a full room VR thing at a mall and it was super cool</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports! </em>– The NFL playoffs are well underway. Of course, the  Bears are not involved, so for once, we'll have to talk about...other teams? <em>Fine</em>. (We finished recording this ahead of the Ben Johnson news, by the way!)</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>HauntedPS1 Demo-Disc: Flipside Frights</em> – I'm not sure what to expect from this one, but I'm not gonna complain about lo-fi horror games.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Xbox Developer Direct + Infinity Nikki </em>– We'll see what Microsoft's up to, and if there's time, take another adventure into dressing up.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Another trip through game of the year. It's possible this is the second and final podcast, it's possible we'll stretch to a third podcast? We're not putting a cap on the discussions, so we'll just have to see!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series </em>– We got halfway through last week's exchange before Rob's stomach exploded, but we'll finish that up and you'll read it this week.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
