		<p>While there’s another two days of Gamescom 2025 over this weekend for the general public, for press, the show always comes to an end on Friday… just in time for me to name drop a few games for What We Played!</p>
<p>But what can I actually tell you about right now? There’s quite a few things embargoed until next week, but in the here and now, I’ve been able to share previews of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Onimusha</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/borderlands-4-preview-gamescom-2025/">Borderlands 4</a>, I played a smidgeon of Kirby Air Ride and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, a little Directive 8020, and on and on and on. The next job is to write as much of this up as quickly as possible, so stay tuned over the next few days and weeks!</p>

<p>Having a far more sedate gaming experience, <strong>Aran</strong> reviewed Tiny Bookshop, and said that the exceptionally chilled out book-selling game “may be my game of the year.” High praise!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Echoes of the End, for review, as well as a bit of&nbsp;Death Stranding and Smash Bros., while Jim has continued on with Far Cry 5, though is starting to feel some of the grind setting in with the open world activities. “There are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh, and I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>


<p><strong>Laura’s</strong> been playing Ra Ra BOOM for our review, and demands that the game’s name “must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos”. She’s been joined by fellow side-scrolling beat ’em up lover Ade, and is loving the game’s art style.</p>
<p>But you can’t keep <strong>Ade</strong> away from other side-scrolling and/or licensed 1980s pop culture! There’s a Shinobi review in the pipe for next week, and he shared his thoughts on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown. Then there was some Rogue Prince of Persia – “which is excellent” – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters, though truth be told, he’s actually mainly played Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>He said, “I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third. Anyone else playing it?”</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been enjoying a trio of post-apocalyptic settings, and while he can’t talk about two of them right now, he can say that he’s actually continued to enjoy Wuchang: Fallen Feathers…. until he spends hours butting up against a brick wall of a boss.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a lashing of the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8 for his smorgasbord of gaming.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> been on holiday, but has been taking a break from taking a break by playing a bit more of Story of Seasons.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ccda75e40182b/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve never been to <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en">Gamescom</a> before. I’ve heard all the rumours, though. Gamescom is obviously an event I’ve been aware of for a very long time and it appears to have been growing in stature as of late – even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-get-a-closer-look-at-nintendos-gamescom-2025-booth">Nintendo decided to return this year</a> after skipping the show in 2024.</p>
<p>If you’ve been to the show before, then this piece isn’t for you. Attending for the first time, I thought I’d share my own experience for those who may want to consider attending in future.</p>
<p>The show takes place at <a href="https://www.koelnmesse.de/">Koelnmesse</a> – no laughing in the back, I know the name sounds like what happens the day after a particularly spicy curry – which is in the German city of Köln (aka Cologne).</p>

<p>The predicted weather for the week was relatively warm 24-28°C (~75-83°F), and only staying for two nights meant I could pack lightly. I filled my trusty <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/gundam-the-08th-ms-team-gundam-backpack-ground-type/13/7097oh">Gundam backpack</a> with some clothes, toiletries and my work gear (laptop, powerbank, etc.), and I was good to go.</p>
<h2>Let’s-a-go!</h2>

<p>Flying from the UK, my journey started early Tuesday morning with a 1-hour drive to Birmingham Airport, boarding a Lufthansa 1.5-hour flight to Munich and then sub 1-hour connecting flight arriving in Cologne mid-afternoon. The return journey was very different, but more on that later.</p>
<p>The airport isn’t that far from the city centre, so taking the train is probably the most cost-effective route. However, time wasn’t really on my side as I still needed to check-in to my hotel in the city and then figure out how to get to the venue before Opening Night Live, there was a simpler answer: Uber.</p>
<p>I’d seen taxi rides quoted at upwards of €100, so the €35 being quoted by Uber seemed logical (and I was sharing the ride with Sammy from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>).</p>
<h2>Where to stay?</h2>
<p>20 minutes or so later we were dropped off at our respective hotels and all checked-in. I stayed at 3-star <a href="https://hotel-windsor-koeln.de/en/">Hotel Windsor</a> – I couldn’t resist the name, having recently visited <em>our own</em> <a href="https://www.legoland.co.uk/">Windsor</a> — which is <em>slightly</em> on the edge of the city but still only a 10-15 min walk.</p>

<p>We did book accommodation slightly late (maybe 1-2 months before), and unfortunately, the prices are clearly hiked up around the time of Gamescom. We’re talking about €200-250 a night for even 3-star hotels. Advice: don’t leave it late, book early!</p>
<p>Location-wise, though, I was relatively happy. The city is split in half by the Rhine River, with the exhibition centre on the right-hand side of the water. Your instinct might be to get a hotel on the same side, but I wouldn’t. The majority of the city restaurants, squares, bars etc. are on the left side.</p>
<h2>Getting Around Cologne</h2>

<p>The two main landmarks will be Koelnmesse itself and <a href="https://www.koelner-dom.de/en">Kölner Dom</a>, Cologne’s absolutely stunning and unmissable (in every sense of the word) Cathedral, which is on the opposite side of the river to the event. These perfect way points mean you <em>shouldn’t</em> get lost.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the central train station is right next to that <em>beyond</em> massive Cathedral, which has a dedicated sign-posted line (or “track” in local speak). This was platform 10 whilst I was there. The Koelnmesse is the next stop across the river, so you can just about jump on any train (check the next stop on the boards).</p>
<p>I’m not going to lie, initially, I found the trains quite difficult to navigate. There are so many different naming conventions compared to the UK. Each route has its own name and there’s a mix of ICE (InnerCity Express) trains which go inter-city and more local trains too.</p>
<p>The good news is that all of this transportation is <em>free</em>. Along with your Gamescom admission ticket you are issued a travel ticket that allows you to take these local trains. The ticket itself says you must carry photo identification, but my ticket was never checked.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it’s easy to walk across the bridge, which takes around 10 minutes side to side.</p>
<h2>Opening Night Live!</h2>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0e4c2d77987c/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As well as never attending Gamescom, I’ve also never been to one of these live showcases. My role has always been to assist our editorial teams during these shows, or simply make sure our websites don’t fall over. They would have to survive without me this time.</p>
<p>The stage and lighting were really impressive in person. Less impressive was the fact that seating was all at floor level, so unless you’re towards the front, your view isn’t anywhere near as good as it would be at a venue with tiered seats.</p>
<p>I don’t understand the concept of “pre-shows” from a consumer point of view, I can only imagine it’s a commercial standpoint to do with pricing. The pre-show had some really cool games that deserved to be in the main show, and the presenting was goofy and bordering on cheap.</p>

<p>At this point, you’ve likely seen the two-hour show (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-every-switch-1-and-2-announcement-and-trailer">or at least the highlights</a>). Attending it in person was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be, similar to watching at home but with the crowd 'woops' and 'cheers' in full Dolby Atmos quality and the bass rumble from the trailers slapping you round the face over and over again. Maybe I’m old but I think it was a bit <em>too</em> loud.</p>
<p>I'm glad I got to experience it, but I’m in no hurry to do it again. Full disclosure, I should also add that Gamescom were kind enough to invite Felix, Sammy and myself to the “VIP” ONL aftershow party where we all consumed at least 1-2 free burgers each.</p>
<h2>Is It Really That Big?</h2>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025 Map" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f0372dfc31bf/gamescom-2025-map.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gamescom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My ticket was provided as a QR code, so adding this to my Apple Wallet made it super easy to enter the exhibition centre at the start of Wednesday - Day 1. No having to collect your badge or wristband anywhere or any of that nonsense. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Now then, the rumours are true: Gamescom is absolutely <em>enormous</em>. Whenever I’ve attended exhibitions in the UK they usually take up 1 or 2 (maybe 3) halls at the NEC or the ExCeL.</p>
<p>Gamescom takes over the <em>entire</em> Koelnmesse exhibition center. You’re talking around 4-5 halls just for the “main” games, 1 hall for merch and cosplay (split across two levels), and another hall for indie and retro games. It’s <em>so</em> big it even spills into the carpark at the back of hall 8.</p>
<p>Throw in another 3 halls for the business only area and you start to understand the scale of it.</p>

<p>Once you get your head around the scale of it you’ll also notice the sheer quality of the stands on offer, because of the amount of floorspace on offer booth after booth oozes with slick design and is a feast for your eyes. Kudos to anyone who worked on these stands.</p>
<p>After doing an entire lap of the show (and taking <em>over 500 photos</em>) the layout was now etched in my head and I’d even discovered some hacks. You can avoid those main corridors with seas of people by moving between halls using the side doors.</p>
<h2>Queues, Queues, Queues</h2>

<p>If you’re looking at my photos thinking “it doesn’t look that bad” please keep reading. Being a member of the press I was able to look around and take all my photos on Wednesday, the day that only a small number of non-trade consumers are able to attend.</p>
<p>I felt the show get noticeably busier on Wednesday afternoon when those consumers were allowed in, but it was <em>nothing</em> compared to Thursday. Oh boy, the rumours keep getting truer.</p>
<p>335,000 people attended Gamescom in 2024 and whilst daily figures aren’t available, you’d have to estimate that at least ⅓ of them were there on each day. It’s hard to imagine 100,000 people shuffling around the event halls but in reality, it’s wave after wave after wave of people moving in every direction constantly – it’s a little overwhelming.</p>

<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of games at the show, true, but every game has a limited capacity, some better than others. Long queues for popular games form almost immediately. Some people have clearly been before and have brought their own fold-out chairs – smart – because they know they are going to be queuing for <em>hour(s)</em> before it’s their turn to grab the controller.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been to a theme park in peak season and waited 2 hours to go on a roller coaster, then you’re in the right ballpark. These are theme park-level of queues, perhaps not in physical length, but in terms of wait time.</p>
<h2>Variety is King</h2>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6eb3b69b7ab3d/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Away from a negative and onto a positive, I was blown away by the amount of different things going on at the show. There was an absolute ton of big games and an amazing amount of indie games too.</p>
<p>No only that, though, there were lots of other attractions such as the EVA (Esports Virtual Arena) booth, a human foosball table, ninja warrior-style challenges and inflatables.</p>

<p>A huge number of peripherals were showcased too, especially those from the sim-racing world, I think I counted at least six different manufacturers of racing wheels all showing off their products on sim rigs.</p>
<p>There was also a complete spectrum (<a href="https://www.timeextension.com/tags/zx-spectrum">not that one</a>) of merchandise too all the way from the stereotypical anime figurine fest all the way up to a fully stocked official LEGO store. I didn’t see anyone selling retro games, though, but almost anything else gaming you can think of.</p>

<p>As a bit of a car nerd, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of cars at the show, including this absolutely beastly GR Yaris.</p>
<h2>What Are The Food and Drink Options?</h2>

<p>The areas outside between the halls are where most of the food vendors can be found. You can get food in some of the halls but they are few and far between. I actually really liked the fact that the show generally separated the food away from the showfloor.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, outside it was the expected pom frites (chips), burgers, bratwursts (hog dogs), fried chicken and pretzels on offer. The quality was decent, probably better than food in the UK, to be honest. I should add that there was also a very popular Subway stand on the showfloor.</p>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7c8c748035204/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, you could get more sweet treats like crepes and churros. Aside from these vendors, there were also some smaller convenience-style stores in the main concourse areas, but I did notice that some of these were cash-only.</p>
<p>Drinks were heavily weighted towards your usual bottles of Coke, Fanta, and Red Bull is clearly very popular in Germany. (TIL Germans love to mix Fanta and Coke to make a drink called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezi">'Spezi'</a>).</p>

<p>Prices were slightly on the high side, with a pretzel and Red Bull setting me back around €9. On the upside service was good, fast and minimal queuing. On the downside, there aren’t many 'proper' places/tables to sit down near these food vans; you’ll end up perched on the floor or a random surface you can find, if you’re lucky.</p>
<h2>Race Across The World</h2>
<p>As I alluded to above, my return journey was not quite as simple. Lufthansa operate trains as “virtual flight connections”. Not quite sure how this worked, I arrived at the train station well ahead of time and managed to decipher the board and found my platform. So far, so good.</p>
<p>I was slightly curious as to how this all worked as the connection time between arrival at the Airport (from the train) and Departure boarding was only 30 minutes or so.</p>
<figure><a title="Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f9896bf84d4e/gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Anthony Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I keep watching the board and suddenly my train is updated and scheduled 5 minutes late. Then 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, then 25 minutes. I check my Lufthansa app, and a notice appears “your connection is now at risk and we are monitoring the situation”. Great. It’s the last flight to BHX of the day, so if I do miss it, I’ll have to be put in a hotel overnight, and my wife will have to miss work tomorrow.</p>
<p>The high-speed (265km/h) ICE train finally arrives, and we depart nearly 35 minutes late. Whilst on the train I study the airport map to see where my gate is and the fastest route – like any good gamer would.</p>
<p>Train pulls into the station, I sling my 8kg backpack on and start running down the platform, up the stairs across the link bridge up more stairs and into the terminal. My calves are burning as it’s now 10 minutes before boarding is due to close.</p>
<p>It’s fairly late in the day, so thankfully the passport control has no queue - the guard stamps my passport and I rush through security. Of course, my backpack gets the dreaded punt of shame into the “we’re going to check your bag” lane.</p>
<p>The clock ticks on like an escape sequence at the beginning of an action game. The guard clears my bag and I sling it back on, looking like Sam Porter Bridges from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_directors_cut">Death Stranding</a> as I continue to run through the airport to my gate.</p>
<p>I reach my gate with 5 minutes to spare, only for an announcement to follow shortly after telling us that boarding is being delayed for 20-25 minutes whilst they “get the plane ready”.</p>
<p>Morale of the story: it’ll be fine.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Cologne was a nice city to visit and I felt safe walking back to my hotel fairly late at night. I can’t claim to have seen loads of the city, but what I saw was pleasant. The city centre is very tourist-friendly as it welcomes visitors to it’s Cathedral on a year-round basis.</p>

<p>Gamescom was similar to shows I’ve attended before, but on a whole new scale. It’s massive. It’s loud. It’s busy. There are people everywhere. It’s hot. It’s tiring – I did 50,000 steps across my Wed-Thu visit. The queues are often long, but not <em>always</em>.</p>
<p>Would I recommend attending? I think it comes down to your priorities. If you’re going hellbent on playing the latest AAA games, it’s a tough ask considering the cost of travel. If you’re going with friends, taking your time and soak up the festival-esque atmosphere and maybe play some games along the way, there is a much better chance you’ll get value for money.</p>
<p>Time for a sleep. 🫠</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First-person survival horror game Stygian: Outer Gods, which launched in early access this past April, has just received its first major content update in its early access journey titled Souls of the Silent Tide. </p>



<p>The new update was released alongside a new trailer, showcasing the introduction of the House of Mists and some of the new horrors that players will experience in Souls of the Silent Tide.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide will have you carefully treading through the ritual site of head witch Agata, though there's also a secret area that you'll have to explore to find, as developer Misterial Games doesn't want to spoil that surprise.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stygian: Outer Gods | Content Update &quot;Souls of the Silent Tide&quot; Available Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5KIwzMS8jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll also meet new characters, and face a few new enemies to defeat, alongside some you're already familiar with that have been given a bit of an updated moveset.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide also includes a new weapon for players to stand against these horrors with, and the update includes the first boss fight that's been added to the game.</p>



<p>If you've not yet checked out Stygian: Outer Gods, this update is a good time to check it out, not just because you'll have what was available at launch, plus this new chunk of content to play through, but because as part of the update's arrival, Misterial Games is discounting Stygian: Outer Gods for a limited time with a 20% discount.</p>



<p>After the sale however, Misterial Games and publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-smoke-and-mirrors-update-july-17/">Fulqrum Publishing</a> confirm that the price of the early access release will actually increase to $24.99 USD / 24.99 EUR / 20.99 GBP. </p>

              <p>The first thing you think about when you hear the word “Pokémon” is probably bright, colorful cartoon characters. A bright yellow Pikachu and a cuddly blue-and-white Snorlax, merrily playing on green grass under a clear blue sky. Even a fire-breathing Charizard is a cheerful orange and would probably give you a hug. So it’s a wonderful peculiarity of the franchise that various games and spin-offs have received some of the creepiest, spookiest horror movie-like trailers and ads we’ve ever seen. Following yesterday’s deeply creepy trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>we’ve compiled the most unsettling Pokémon commercials from the last few years.</p> <p>You don’t really have to scratch very deep into Pokémon lore to find the weirdness. In fact, given it’s a game series about capturing wild animals and forcing them to fight, so you don’t even have to scratch at all. But take a look at any Pokédex and you’ll quickly <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634">find descriptions that’d have any child concerned about going to sleep at night</a>, and hell, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-top-10-worst-bruxish-mr-rime-1851606325">plenty of the Pokémon themselves are self-contained nightmares</a>. With Ghost Type and Poison Type Pokémon a routine part of the games and anime, there’s always a background element of outright strangeness that underscores so many of these gorgeous games. Which is perhaps what The Pokémon Company is tapping into when it so frequently puts out full-on unsettling, even disturbing promotional material.</p> <p>A lot of these commercials appeared in 2022, ahead of the launch of <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, but there were super-strange “found footage” creations for <em>Pokémon GO</em> as well. And clearly TPCi is still fond of the idea, given the reprisal of the horror-like approach for its latest commercial for&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which both apes Japanese horror games like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil </em>and&nbsp;also <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ghost-girl-x-y-mega-victreebel-2000619524">hides creepy easter eggs for ghostly legends</a> from <em>Pokémon</em>‘s past. We’re really hoping to see a whole bunch more of these in the future, either in the run-up to <em>Z-A</em>‘s October release, or as the new Gen X Pokémon are finally revealed for the next mainline entry.</p>

 <h2>Zorua doesn’t care that a guy just died</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/official-trailer-asks-what-if-pokemon-legends-arceus-1847891305">So we begin in October 2021</a>, and the build up to <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, with what I still think is the most effectively disturbing effort yet. Completely out of nowhere, the official Pokémon YouTube channel posted the following:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Rare footage of the Hisui region discovered! | Pokémon Legends: Arceus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayJvMf--68Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I just cannot celebrate this extraordinary trailer enough. It would have been so easy to go so much less hard, to offer many more clear shots of the snowy landscape, even give us more than a split-second glimpse of those two Snorunt, and then offer some scratchy images of the mysterious Pokémon in question. But someone was brave enough to say “No.” This is full-on VHS artifacting, barely discernible, and as a result so, so much more creepy. And, well, it sure sounds like the guy gets killed at the end.</p> <p>The next day, all was revealed. The <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1451171423607795716">ever-reliable Professor Oak was able to clear up the footage considerably</a>, producing the following:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mysterious footage restored! | Pokémon Legends: Arceus" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEb9gbJUUeA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>And it gets better! This could so easily have been a goof, a reveal that actually it was all fine, just made to look spooky because we couldn’t see. In fact, for a while it looks like that’s what we’re getting, with the jolly Snorunt gallivanting in the snow. Perhaps the scream at the end was just him tripping over or something? But no! After Prof. Oak removed the VHS effects layer in Premiere, this second version is somehow more disturbing than the first. Sure, we get the lovely reveal of the brand new Hisuan Zorua and Zoroark, but then the final punch of…who knows what that was?! A giant, terrifying smoke monster, lost from&nbsp;<em>Lost</em>? And he’s definitely still dead. Which makes the cold, uninterested way the Zorua and Zoroark just turn and walk away all the more disturbing.</p> <h2>Ultra Beasts are straight-up threatening humanity</h2> <p>A year later, in August 2022, <em>Pokémon GO</em> is about to add Ultra Beasts to the game for the first time. To accompany these, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR">the official&nbsp;<em>POGO</em> YouTube channel</a> begins uploading TikTok-style 20 second videos that seem part found footage, part fever dream. They’re stunningly well made, and so very effective for—appropriately—showing Pokémon appearing in the real world. The first five were compiled here:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="*CONFIDENTIAL* REPORT: Ultra Beast Sightings" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr966xaQywg?list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR"></iframe></p> <p>By far the best is the Xurkitree. It’s just so utterly frightening, the way it’s clinging to the outside of the building, the guy’s fear, and the creature’s very obviously harmful intent. But I also absolutely adore the reveal in that final Nihilego clip, when you see it’s not just one inquisitive creature, but some sort of mass invasion. (The Buzzwole one is so poor I kind of hate it for being included.) Then later came <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwFD034UDAc&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=9">so many more</a>, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MO0C8Hhs3M&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=6">this terrified panic</a> as a Guzzlord breaks through a portal above a busy Japanese street. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1rpuYsEot0&amp;list=PL6XC1i5bNldkcuh75SCejjsuwFDTwIcBR&amp;index=14">check out the arrival of a massive Celesteela in Australia</a>, causing awe and fear. (And crucially, they’re all better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-niantic-nintendo-pheromosa-tiktok-dtf-1849477754">the weird-ass TikTok ad that was about a guy trying to sleep with a Pheromosa</a>.)</p> <h2>The cute little doggy that plays with you to death</h2> <p>OK, let’s jump forward just one month to October 2022, with Pokémon in full swing revealing more and more new entries in the Gen IX Pokédex. And once again, we have people screaming and disappearing at the end of the clips. It started with a 15-second video called “Ghost-type Pokémon in Paldea?!”</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost-type Pokémon in Paldea?! #PokemonScarletViolet" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTDRBA4sqPw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>That bait-and-switch with the glimpse of the Gengar and the purple bush is *chef’s kiss*, made all the better for the delicious grin on the mean ol’ ghosty’s face when he properly freaks her out. Once again, more was revealed a day later. This time our brave filmographer has returned to the scene at night, initially spooked as a delightful Mimikyu darts across the path, before then being an awful lot braver in the face of the cheeky Gengar. But there’s something else she’s interested in: a strange purple light on the ground. Suddenly, the creature leaps out from the earth! And it’s a gorgeous little doggy with a purple candle on its back. Yay! Nothing can go wrong, and surely no one’s going to die this time.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="[UK] A new Ghost-type Pokémon appeared in Paldea!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SjpZuQmjGg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Nope, she’s dead. We know this because it turned out the Greavard, as described <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Greavard_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">in the Pokédex</a>, “gradually drains the life energy of those close to it.” But in case you thought this was malevolent, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634/15">its <em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>dex entry reads</a>,</p>

 <p>“It is said that a dog Pokémon that died in the wild without ever interacting with a human was reborn as this Pokémon.”</p> <h2>The jar of matcha that just murders a bunch of children</h2> <p>Another year forward, into August 2023, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666">there’s a surprise new short film</a> added to the official channel to explain the backstory of Sinistea’s new evolutionary form introduced in&nbsp;<em>Scarlet</em> and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s DLC, Poltchageist.</p> <p>We already knew that Sinistea had a fairly messed-up existence. It’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-pokedex-entry-nintendo-switch-1849831634/8">literally “the soul of someone who died alone” trapped in a cup of tea</a>, and it’ll do you no good to drink it.&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s Pokédex explains,</p> <p>“Sinistea gets into your body when you drink it, and then it steals your vitality from within. It also tastes awful.”</p>

 <p>Yum! So what about the evolved form? Well, gather around children.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Haunting Tale of Poltchageist" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMWrwe9fJJk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I adore how tonally all over the place this is. It’s an old man telling a story to a group of very young children, that’s then immediately about a guy dying miserable and alone, before going on to talk about a Pokémon that both fixes cracks and poisons people and drains the life from their bodies as an act of revenge. That’s a messed-up thing to tell a bunch of children! But then, the storyteller’s chipped mug is restored, just like in the story! Ah, you think, he’s playing a fun prank on the children, giving them a little spooky scare. But no. No, it’s not that. Is it that Poltchageist has poisoned them all, and now is going to kill them? They sure don’t look very well. But then our friendly little cartoon killer swings by the camera, gives us a wink, and we circle in on him, Looney Tunes-style. The end! Utterly extraordinary.</p> <h2>Spinarak delivers an epic jumpscare</h2> <p>And that brings us up-to-date, and to yesterday’s <em>Legends Z-A</em> trailer. Aping games like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, the footage ostensibly created to reveal the existence of a Mega Evolved form of Victreebel contains some splendid scares, including an epic jumpscare from that cutest of beasties, Spinarak.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Given the context of the above examples, it’s definitely a big shame this one ends with a “wakka wakka!” explanation of the situation, denuding it of impact. But that’s not before that splendid little burst of frantic freakery in the middle, and that’s valuable.</p> <p>However, it all took on an even spookier tone when we noticed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ghost-girl-x-y-mega-victreebel-2000619524">the ghost girl staring through the window</a>!</p> <p>Please, Pokémon, keep this sort of stuff coming. We&nbsp;<em>love</em> it. Hopefully there’s something super-spoopy lined up for this October, given that seems to bring out the best in them.</p>

Yup, that means it's time to play (or replay) the original Hollow Knight! Which is exactly what a lot of folks are doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight, released on PC in 2017, has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#48h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached an all-time high concurrent player count today on Steam (per SteamDB)</a>, eight years after release, almost certainly due to the Silksong news.

But after the Silksong news yesterday, they began climbing, reaching 16k yesterday afternoon and dipping slightly overnight before shooting up again today in a playercount that seems poised to climb even higher throughout the day and into the weekend. The previous all-time high was over 20k players in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is likely due to a surge of players running to replay Hollow Knight, or play it for the first time, ahead of the release of Silksong on September 4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveler’s Tales is once again bringing a boatload of brick-breaking battles with bat-baddies to the streets of Gotham City. For 20 years, the studio has largely followed the beloved and established formula of adapting some of the biggest media franchises in the world and turning them into level-based action-adventures. But this time, TT looks to be finding inspiration outside of its own walls, but elsewhere inside its Warner Bros. family, giving the people what they want: a new Batman Arkham game in all but name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legacy of the Dark Knight is structured slightly differently from previous LEGO games. Not quite an original story, TT Games has immersed itself in the world of the Bat by taking different strands of the hero’s most famous stories from across comics and films to craft a narrative on its own. You’ll get a young Bruce Wayne origin story, which appears to take inspiration from Batman Begins, if the trailer is anything to go by, but later meet a Joker born in a vat of corrosive materials before later morphing into a version of Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning portrayal for a chapter or two.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to play through a full mission from early in the story, which took me to Ace Chemicals, a version styled heavily on the factory’s look from Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman. However, the story taking place inside those neo-gothic walls takes a leaf straight from the pages of Ed Brubaker’s one-shot comic The Man Who Laughs, as Batman is sent to investigate Red Hood. The context is set up through familiar slapstick LEGO silliness as the Bat is asked to track down three separate shipments of teddy bears in order to find what nefarious use Hood has for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This opening takes place outside of the plant’s walls and allowed me to experiment with the instantly recognisable combat suite. I punched grunts a few times until their plastic legs broke free from their torsos and countered whenever they dared flash that little attack signal over the top of their head. Fans of the Batman: Arkham games will know exactly what I’m talking about here (as well as anyone who played the many, many action games Rocksteady’s system inspired), but from the little I experienced, I can’t see it getting much more mechanically complex from here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can't think about being Batman in a video game without appreciating the achievements of our friends and colleagues at Rocksteady.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That obvious Arkham inspiration and desire to bring it to an even wider audience is something that Jonathan Smith, Head of Production and Strategic Director at TT Games, willfully admitted to me: “You can't think about being Batman in a video game without appreciating the achievements of our friends and colleagues at Rocksteady”, Smith said. “So as we start to think about what a rich, deep Batman combat experience is going to be like, of course, we use that as an inspiration, but then we also have new approaches that we bring to that in terms of accessibility”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The punches, kicks, and throws may well be rooted in the moveset first established in 2009’s Batman: Arkham Asylum, but this is a TT LEGO game appealing to players of all ages, so I can’t see intricate button combos becoming a key aspect. Slow-motion finishers add a sense of style to proceedings, further adding to that familiar Arkham flow. All in all, brawling felt good, if not as wholly satisfying as in Asylum and its sequels, perhaps due to the fact that making contact against the synthetic shine of LEGO bricks never fully delivers the meaty sensation that pounding flesh can (yes, I did mean to phrase it like that).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, as much as the Caped Crusader enjoys shattering cheekbones with his blunt fists and padded knees, stealth has also been a big part of his games. Again, while it doesn’t feel as robust in its design as the Arkham games, Legacy of the Dark Knight does cater to the sneakier option. High structures and perches loom ominously above enemies, which can be zipped to with ease. From there, you can use a version of detective mode that acts more like an area of effect pulse than a toggleable X-ray vision to pick out enemies below. Stealth takedowns can then be performed on your chosen prey and are animated with trademark LEGO humour; instead of a swift knockout blow, Batman will land on them with a minifig-shattering thud of his arse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the combat is heavily Arkham-coded, the remainder of the mission plays out like a classic TT adventure. Platforming is integrated through moving platforms and swinging hooks, as are puzzles that require you to switch between characters (or get help from your co-op partner) to utlise their specific skills. On this mission, I was joined by Jim Gordon, who comes packed with a foam-spraying gun that can fire blobs of goo to help you past obstacles. For example, Ace Chemicals is unsurprisingly full of hazardous chemicals, some of which can be seen spurting out of broken pipes and halting you in your path. A quick blast of the Commissioner’s cannon can soon dispose of this mess, as when it hardens, it blocks up the hole in the pipe. Past that, a door may be locked, but thanks to an obvious grappling point, it can be yanked down using Batman’s hook. It’s this swapping between batfriends and their skills that has formed the basis of LEGO games since the first Star Wars adaptation back in 2005, and still holds a certain level of charm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It does beg the question of how varied missions will be this time around, though, and the range of puzzles we’ll be faced with. When making my way through Ace Chemicals, I didn’t quite get the same “metroidvania-esque” feeling I often associate with LEGO games — knowing there’ll be many secret areas inaccessible on a first-playthrough as they require abilities you’ve not yet unlocked. This might be due to the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-really-does-have-just-7-playable-characters-and-its-dividing-fan-opinion"><u>only seven characters will be playable in Legacy of The Dark Knight</u></a>, and thus the variety of powers and gadgets is vastly reduced — especially compared to The Skywalker Saga’s roster of around 400. That treasure-hunting replayability factor is a huge draw for some, so I fear a little if this is the case, but perhaps that portion of the experience is being reserved mainly for its open world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I only got to spend around 10 minutes in a small outdoor section of Gotham City, but found no shortage of things to get up to. That Arkham muscle-memory kicked in as I grapple-hooked onto a nearby roof and launched into the air before spreading my Batwings and assessing the crime-ridden alleys for activity. In my short time, I prevented a crime in progress by thumping a few goons, completed a Riddler trophy puzzle, and attempted a time trial in a Batmobile of my choosing — The Dark Knight’s Tumbler, 2022’s muscle-car like monster from The Batman, and accompanying Batcycle were on offer. Character outfits are customisable, from golden age comic interpretations to modern movie looks. How these are unlocked is yet unclear, but I wouldn’t be surprised if spending time collecting treasures dotted around the open world plays into this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial impressions that Legacy of The Dark Knight is an Arkham game in a LEGO wrapping are fairly spot-on, then. I settled snugly into the middle-ground between dynamic combat and collectathon puzzling the series has rooted itself so successfully in for years. I’m left very hopeful from the hour or so I’ve spent with it so far, and think it could be the perfect thing to tide Arkham fans over until Rocksteady (or somebody else willing to take up the mantle) answers the call of the Batsignal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

                <p>Team Cherry has finally, at long last, confirmed that Hollow Knight: Silksong is not only a real game, but that it will be available to play on September 4. That is soon. The game will be available to buy outright at launch, but will it also come to any subscription services, like Xbox Game Pass?</p><h3><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be on Game Pass.</strong></h3><p>Microsoft and Team Cherry have confirmed an Xbox Game Pass release for the highly anticipated game. It will be available via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, so subscribers can play it across console and PC. Alternatively, people can get Silksong via PC Game Pass for PC-only access.</p><p>It's possible Silksong could come to the less-expensive Game Pass tiers, like Game Pass Standard and Game Pass Core, at some point down the road--but this is not confirmed. If it ever does, it likely wouldn't be soon.</p><p>2017's Hollow Knight is currently available on Xbox Game Pass, or it can be purchased for $15. Hollow Knight is also available via Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra Game Catalogue.</p><p>There is no indication that Silksong could launch into PlayStation Plus.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> announced a surprise release date of September 4 on <a href="https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thursday</a>. Alongside fans rushing to clear their schedules and games writers who have to plan around a lack of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review code</a>, some indie developers are delaying their games in response.</p><p>Panik Arcade, developers of <a href="https://aftermath.site/cloverpit-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slot machine roguelike</a> <em>CloverPit</em>, announced Friday that they’re moving the game’s planned release date from September 3 to September 26. In a blog on Steam titled “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3314790/view/520848458437886253?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We have to delay <em>CloverPit</em> a bit (<em>Silksong</em> lol</a>),” they wrote</p><blockquote><p>Some of you might already have guessed the reason for the delay: <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>The release date for <em>Silksong</em> was announced yesterday, and it’s only one day after <em>CloverPit</em> our original launch date [sic].<em> Silksong</em> is the most anticipated and wishlisted game on all of Steam and we think people will love this game and play it right at launch (including us) but that also means it will overshadow all games launching close to it. So if we stick to our original date we would risk the launch of <em>CloverPit</em> a fair bit.</p><p>We poured our hearts into our little game so of course we want to give it the best possible shot.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>PanikArcade wrote that they plan to use the delay to further polish the game.</p><p>Another indie developer, Frogteam Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frogteam.games/post/3lwwege2ipc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Thursday afternoon shortly after the <em>Silksong</em> reveal that they were delaying the demo of their metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837590/Stomp_and_the_Sword_of_Miracles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</em></a> from August 29 to an unspecified date. Frogteam wrote that they had been planning to launch a Kickstarter for the game on September 12, “with the demo giving it a little boost beforehand,” but that they now “need to delay the demo for the sake of <em>Stomp</em>'s development. I want to give the demo room to shine, and I want to do what I can to make sure the Kickstarter is a success.” They also cited <em>Silksong</em> in their statement, writing</p><blockquote><p>Team Cherry has suddenly announced that <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the most highly anticipated metroidvania I've ever seen, is going to release on September 4th.</p><p>Trying to market an indie game is already really, really hard. It's the task of trying to get attention in a deep sea of other amazing games. In the case of <em>Silksong</em>, however, I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale. Tiny devs like me rely on word of mouth and streamers to bring in visibility, and everyone's gonna be busy with <em>Silksong</em> for quite a while!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Aeternum Game Studios planned to launch their metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Aeterna Lucis</em></a>, a sequel to their 2021 game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517970/Aeterna_Noctis/?curator_clanid=44082790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Aeterna Noctis</em></a>, in September, but announced on <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> Friday that they’ve now decided to delay the game to 2026. The studio wrote that “after the announcement of <em>Silksong</em>, we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.”</p><p>Aeternum cited a lack of dev kits as another reason for the delay and noted that “the game is already finished.” The studio also wrote</p><blockquote><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank Team Cherry. There’s no need to wish them luck–we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece. Instead of rivalry, what we feel is gratitude: thanks to them, the metroidvania genre is more alive than ever and in fact, they were one of the main inspirations that led us to create <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> and the entire saga now in development.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In contrast, indie studio Necrosoft has used <em>Silksong</em>’s release date to promote its RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demonschool</em></a>, releasing on September 3. The studio wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lwx26vg5cc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, “Okay, sure, <em>Silksong</em> is going to sell millions of copies. But can you play it in 4:3 on your CRT like <em>Demonschool</em>!?”&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Panik Arcade, Frogteam, Aeternum, and Necrosoft for more information.</p><p>It’s not a surprise to see indie games, especially those in the same genre as <em>Silksong</em>, feeling the need to rethink their plans in light of Team Cherry’s long-awaited sequel. AAA games faced a similar challenge planning their releases around the generational juggernaut of <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, with some publishers telling <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> back in March that they were waiting to confirm their release dates until Rockstar picked theirs. (<em>GTA VI</em> was ultimately <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> to May 2026.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Silksong</em>, however, is an indie from a small studio, and it came by its tidal wave of hype uniquely — growing over the years from a respectably anticipated sequel to a full-on myth sans traditional marketing. While the game’s release certainly feels like An Event, it’s difficult to say whether it will suck the air out of the room in the same way as something like <em>GTA VI</em>. Can <em>Silksong</em> live up to the sheer weight of expectation placed upon it? And does this kind of intrigue translate to sales and days or weeks of rapt attention? For now, it’s unclear, but it’s hard to blame developers for going with a “better safe than sorry” approach.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is pretty darned slick. Gearbox had promised a grand overhaul of the game’s movement systems, a rejig of how weapons and customisation all works, and obviously a whole new planet to rampage across as a Vault Hunter, and I could definitely feel a lot of that when jumping into the game at Gamescom.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Gameplay Overview - Harlowe" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDrYNvTaFHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s really the enhanced movement that stood out for me. Gearbox has thrown everything into this – baby, bathwater and the kitchen sink – to give perhaps the broadest movement options found in a first person shooter. With a dash, a double jump, a glide, a grappling hook, and even all the Vault Hunters having learnt to swim, the only thing that’s really left for Borderlands 5 is straight up teleporting everywhere!</p>


<p>Beyond just letting you explore the bigger, broader open areas that Gearbox have promised for the game world, the enhanced movement will really allow for more front-foot combat styles, helping close gaps quickly to unload that spicy shotgun you have, while grapple points can be a great way get to elevated positions as a sniper to unload. Though, of course, there’s nothing that’s going to stop you just keeping your distance and blasting away, as you would have done in previous games.</p>
<p>Speaking of weapons, there’s now a myriad of new possibilities — and that’s saying something, considering how broad, sprawling and crazy the options were before. There’s a handful of new weapon manufacturers that define their particular styles, so Order weapons are charge and release, while Daedalus guns can use multiple ammo types. But there’s much more control over them thanks to now being able to combine mods and properties, blending the series’ distinctive weapon tweaks to let you create something that little bit more special.</p>


<p>A Jakobs pistol, for example, has critical hits that will see the bullets ricochet to nearby enemies, but why not add a Tediore accessory that gives your gun legs, so you can thrown it on the ground and have it keep blasting your enemies? Or a Maliwan SMG that has radiation and cryo elements to switch between, but with a Tediore accessory that has you throw on reload, homing in on enemies and exploding into four further grenades? Things can get pretty wild…</p>
<p>Another great twist is being able to replace the typical grenade or ordinance slot with another weapon, giving you a heavy weapon outlet that’s surprisingly just on a cooldown. You won’t have many bullets each time, but when you can reliably trigger another significant damage dealer, it liberates you from the pain of running out of ammo for your best guns.</p>

<p>We got to play with Harlowe for the first time, trying out the new Gravatar class with some high tech options for her Ability. We stuck with the CHROMA Accelerator for her Action Skill, firing off slow-moving energy pocket orbs that deal Cryo damage and can explode on command to deal further damage. Her alternate Actions put enemies in Stasis, again with a damaging effect, or place a Flux Generator that projects a damaging field to enemies while granting allies Overshield.</p>
<p>Battling through the Vault of Inceptus for this demo took us down to a series of floating rock islands in the foggy aether, battling against Seneschal robots and soldier types; animalistic Pinheads which charged at us; and tougher, named enemies to boot. We battled through each area to power up the bounce pad to the next area, ultimately flying through the sky to a hollowed out arena to face the Primordial Guardian Inceptus — a big, broad metallic-looking creature with two stinging tails and shifting attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>Initially it bounds around this space, leaping in to attack with a sweep of its tails, before jumping up to the roof and spawning poisonous pustules adding hazards to the ground for you to avoid. That’s nothing compared to when it’s folded up in a cocoon of leaves, spreading a poisonous gas on the floor that forces you to adapt and stay up in the air.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly challenging boss battle, and really the main shame is that I don’t feel like I made the most of all of the gameplay possibilities that the game presents me. Much like min-maxing your builds in a Diablo game, you can often just go in blasting and have a nice time, but dropping into the middle of the game and with completely new loadouts to use, I didn’t quite grasp the best way to use Harlowe’s Action Skill — tricky when trying to target a fast-moving boss— and I failed to notice the grapple points in the final boss arena, which would have really helped me to stay up and away from the poisoned gas clouds. I was trying instead to jump and glide to stay off the ground, which was not entirely successful…</p>
<p>But, what I did see from this all-too-brief hands on opportunity was the potential that all of these additions off. Having enjoyed the earlier games in the Borderlands series, but skipping out on the last game, Borderlands 4 looks promising after, and is likely to pull me back into the looter shooter fold when it launches on 12th September.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco popped up at the Partner Direct last month to reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>. It's not due out until 24th October, but the studio is getting the ball rolling early by sharing a first look at the opening movie.</p>
<p>The two-minute video is full of all the classic sphere-pushing you would expect from a Katamari game. The key hook this time is era-hopping, and the movie brings that in full. Just look at that little guy work his way through the Wild West, dinosaurs, pirates and more, all while picking up objects of varying sizes.</p>
<p>All this is accompanied by one of the catchier theme songs we've heard in recent years, with chelmico's 'Katamari Time!' playing throughout.</p>
<p>We had a great time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/we_love_katamari_reroll_plus_royal_reverie">We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie</a> when it arrived on Switch back in 2023, so here's hoping that the next entry can hit similar highs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has arrived at Gamescom 2025 with two significant The Division 2-related announcements. Beginning with what the company is calling a "<em>survival extraction experience</em>," The Division 2: Survivors is due to launch sometime in 2026 and is the latest major part of what's been a long-tail for The Division 2 support.</p>



<p>The other big announcement is the arrival of a mobile game in The Division series, with a new free-to-play MMO called The Division Resurgence. </p>



<p>"<em>The Division 2: Survivors will bring an updated take on the survival extraction experience to The Division 2</em>," Ubisoft writes in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence">blog post</a>. Development on it is still "<em>in the early stages</em>," and is being led by Magnus Jansén as its creative director, who has been with the series since the first game which launched in 2016.</p>



<p>"<em>The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours,"</em> adds executive producer Julian Gerighty, "<em>and we strive for transparency during its development. Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey</em>." Speaking of Gerighty, he's also directing The Division 3, which we've still not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">since it was first announced in 2023</a>.</p>



<p>That's all Ubisoft had to say about Survivors for now, though they did share a few images of concept art. </p>

<p>It also showed a graphic for a roadmap for The Division series, which, you'll notice, doesn't include The Division 3. </p>

<p>Regarding The Division Resurgence, Ubisoft says it will have "<em>the same gameplay experience as the Division games adapted to mobile gaming."</em> It'll take players into Manhattan, and be set a few months after the events of the first Division game.</p>



<p>Even though it is an exclusive mobile release, which might immediately make fans of The Division who play the games on PC or consoles disinterested, if you're big on the lore and story of the series, you might want to consider checking it out, since "<em>the Division Resurgence will bridge the narrative gap between the Division 1 and 2, adding to the existing lore with additional story beats over time</em>."</p>



<p>That said, you could also just wait to watch a recap on YouTube. But if you are keen to actually play through the story content, you can register for it now, and potentially take part in a closed beta test.</p>

<p>The last major update for The Division 2 was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">Battle for Brooklyn</a> which launched earlier this year. The next major update is the launch of Year 7's season 2, The Pact, which launches in a few weeks from the time of this writing on September 9.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-may-hint-at-return-to-dark-sun-setting.1278393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Unearthed Arcana. This latest batch of playtest material features new apocalyptic-themed character subclasses, which may hint at the company returning to one of its older, and darker, settings.</p>

<h2>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana Apocalyptic Subclass Announcement</h2>

<p>As always, the latest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana is free to download from <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/apocalyptic-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. The new playtest material uses the 2024 rules and features four new character subclasses for the Druid, Fighter, Sorceror, and Warlock. Each subclass appears to take on a darker, postapocalyptic theme.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-circle-of-preservation-text-screenshot.jpg?itok=gueOLHGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-circle-of-preservation-text-screenshot.jpg?itok=k2tE8BeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Circle of Preservation Druid is all about protection. Druids of this circle can expend a use of their Wild Shape to create a large area of vegetation to grow which heals allies and cures them of certain conditions. At later levels, you can even eschew expensive material components for more advanced spells and have your hallowed areas deal radiant damage to enemies.</p>

<p>The Gladiator Fighter features a combination of martial prowess and bloody showmanship. Their Brutality mechanic lets them layer on additional weapon mastery effects with every hit like Vex or Topple, and can add their Charisma bonus to certain skill rolls. At later levels, the Gladiator also gets a Parry and Mutilate ability, which can debuff bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>The third subclass in this <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana is the Defiled Sorcery Sorceror. This Sorceror can expend hit dice to increase the damage of a spell attack. The twist is the hit dice spent can either be theirs or the enemy. At later levels, they gain auras which grant resistance to certain damage types and helps them regain sorcery points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-sorceror-king-warlock-text.jpg?itok=NJk6qhxA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-sorceror-king-warlock-text.jpg?itok=RSw-Bxw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there is the Sorcerer-King Patron Warlock. As the name implies, Warlocks make a pact with a tyrannical demigod or incredibly powerful magical despot for power. As a result, you can cast certain spells like <em>Command</em> or <em>Hold Person</em> without verbal or somatic components and create auras that can make enemies frightened of you. Their endgame features include forcing enemies to auto-fail attacks.</p>

<p>On the surface, the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana appears to be an innocuous batch of playtest material. But it is no secret that UAs usually allude to future books or supplements that Wizards of the Coast are working on. Their<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Arcane subclass UA</a> hinting at the new Forgotten Realms books, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised Artificer</a> foreshadows the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron</a> book.</p>

<p>With that in mind, there is a strong chance this Unearthed Arcana may imply Wizards of the Coast may return to the apocalyptic world of Dark Sun in a future book. This would be a major departure from the high fantasy of Faerun or the steampunk sensibilities of Eberron.</p>

<p>Dark Sun is set in the post-apocalyptic world of Athas, full of barren wastelands, slavery, and wizard tyrants that use the lives of their subjects to power spells. It has more in common with <em>Mad Max</em> or the classic <em>Conan The Barbarian</em> stories than <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. It is also a notoriously problematic setting packed various negative stereotypes.</p>

<p>Given the thematic text and mechanical function seen in the UA, these subclasses would be right at home in such a setting. But does beg the question as to how WOTC will present the dark themes in the setting if they choose to revisit it in 2024.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong Gameplay (Over The Shoulder Filmed) | gamescom 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those curious, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/2546388" rel="nofollow ">previous Kickstarter update</a> was a post right after E3 2019 talking about a demo for Hollow Knight: Silksong. Funnily enough, the Gamescom demo playable this week seems to be nearly identical to the experience from E3 2019 (an event that no longer exists). GameSpot did get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on time with Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Kickstarter backers receiving Hollow Knight: Silksong codes was foreshadowed yesterday when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier posted on social media that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-reviews-probably-arent-going-to-be-ready-for-launch/1100-6534191/">reviews probably wouldn't be ready before the game's launch</a>. That's reportedly because Team Cherry would find it unfair for critics to play the game earlier than original backers.</p><p dir="ltr">The anticipation for Hollow Knight: Silksong's upcoming launch feels pretty tangible. For instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/">Hollow Knight just hit an all-time concurrent-players peak on Steam</a> with over 22,000 people. In addition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">at least three indie games are pushing back their release dates</a> now to avoid coming out near Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

		<p>Happy Friday! It is the end of a week of annual leave for me though, so it is a deflated Friday for me. I have been on my hollibobs with my Switch, and while I had set out to play a bunch of things, the only thing I played was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> for hours, and hours and hours. You can have my full review of it next week!</p>
<p>Tef, meanwhile, is at that Gamescom, playing all sorts of things, including the awesome-looking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">No Ghosts at the Grand</a>. He will have loads of things to tell you about in the next few weeks as well, so definitely look out for that.</p>

<p>Aran has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/tiny-bookshop-review/">Tiny Bookshop</a> for review, saying,&nbsp; “It is such a chilled out game. It may be my game of the year!” Strong words for the end of August!</p>
<p>Gamoc has been playing Echoes of the End for review, which he loves, as well as a bit of Death Stranding and Smash Bros.</p>

<p>Jim is still chipping away at Far Cry 5 and although some of the open-world activities are starting to repeat themselves, there are plenty of cool diversions such as platforming-like Prepper Stash sections to keep things fresh. He says, “I’m now mainlining my way towards the ending and have the Vietnam War DLC in my sights.”</p>

<p>Ade polished off his reviews for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/21/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>. He also played through the side-scrolling cheerleader beat ’em up Ra Ra Boom with Laura for her review. He’s been packing the gaming in this week though, continuing, “I’ve also tried the new Rogue Prince of Persia on PlayStation Plus – which is excellent – and a few more missions in Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters. Though most of my gaming time has been spent playing Marvel Rivals! I wasn’t impressed with the game when I played it last year but the devs have made a lot of improvements and now it’s really fun! Cloak and Dagger is my favourite pick, with Squirrel Girl and The Punisher a close second and third.”</p>
<p>Laura has been playing Ra Ra Boom, telling us, “The title of which must always be sung – to your choice of notes but ideally to the tune of the theme song for extra kudos) with @Ade. We love a good side-scrolling beat em up and Ra Ra Boom (sing it!) has such a gorgeous art style!”</p>

<p>Steve has been deeply immersed in three completely different postapocalyptic settings (four if you count the state of the real world) but two of those are super secret so he’s just been playing, “The continuing adventures of Wuchang super sexy bird girl which is still following the pattern of being really enjoyable until I spend hours bashing my head against a brick wall boss.”</p>
<p>Finally, Miguel has been playing some Shuten Order for review, along with a little Death Stranding 2, a few rounds in the playtest for Fate Trigger, and a couple nights of Tekken 8!</p>
<p>So then, have you been playing anything this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher A Plus and developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology have announced that Blue Protocol: Star Resonance will arrive on PC, iOS, and Android this coming October 2025. Pre-registration for mobile players also kicks off today, as well as the closed beta test for participants on PC.</p>



<p>If you're looking to play Blue Protocol: Star Resonance on mobile, then you can pre-register for the game on its <a href="https://www.playbpsr.com/">official website</a>. If you'd rather check it out on PC, then instead of just waiting for its October launch, you can jump into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/">closed beta test through Steam</a> starting today. If you missed the chance to sign up for the beta test, A Plus has confirmed that it will "<em>continuously release codes depending on the server capacity after the test begins</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Blue Protocol: Star Resonance | Closed Beta Test Recruitment" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Px_DtSUjs4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Star Resonance marks the return of the MMORPG after the original Blue Protocol release, which first arrived in Japan in 2023, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down a year later,</a> and had its release outside of Japan cancelled. It officially shut down this past January, with the reason for its closure simply being that it was unable to garner enough of a player base to keep going.</p>



<p>If you're happy to see it return and are looking forward to its October launch, beyond the closed beta test, A Plus has confirmed that attendees at the Anime NYC convention will be able to check out a playable demo of the game.</p>

      <div><p>Stone Blade Entertainment recently launched a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em>. The campaign celebrating a milestone for the iconic deckbuilding game is a runaway success, reaching its goal within minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/stoneblade/ascension-15th-anniversary#/section/rewards/reward-product-85307" rel="nofollow"><em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em></a> provides both newcomers and veteran players a pristine version of the game, complete with a promotional embossed tin case, foil cards, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Yesterday, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> developers Team Cherry announced a September 4th release date for the long-awaited game, and indie developers are announcing delays to get out of the way of the launch. <em>Silksong</em> is a full sequel to the excellent <em>Hollow Knight</em> and is currently the most wishlisted game on Steam, so it’s likely going to be very popular when it’s finally available.</p><p>Panik Arcade, which was set to release its “hellish gambling roguelike” <em>CloverPit</em> on September 3rd, has pushed the game’s launch to September 26th. “We poured our hearts into our little game so of course we want to give it the best possible shot,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F3314790%2Fview%2F520848458437886253" rel="sponsored">Panik Arcade says</a>. “We hope you can understand — we’ll use the extra time of course to polish the game even further and we hope for your support at launch either way.”</p><p>Talegames, which was planning to launch the adventure RPG <em>Faeland</em> out of early access on September 9th, is postponing the release and plans to share a new date soon. “This wasn’t an easy decision,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1280080%2FFaeland%2F" rel="sponsored">Talegames says</a>. “We’ve poured years of work and love into <em>Faeland</em>, and we want to make sure it arrives at a time when it can receive the attention and care it deserves.”</p><p>Aeternum Game Studios, which is developing a 2D sidescrolling game focused on combat and exploration called <em>Aeterna Lucis</em>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">is postponing</a> a planned September release to sometime in 2026 because the game “wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves.” Aeternum also says that it still doesn’t have the development kits to “ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms,” so the delay means it can “bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.”</p><p>Frogteam Games, which is working on the 2D exploration game <em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</em>, is delaying a planned August 29th demo launch, as spotted <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays">by <em>Aftermath</em></a>. “Trying to market an indie game is already really, really hard,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2837590%2FStomp_and_the_Sword_of_Miracles%2F" rel="sponsored">Frogteam Games says</a>. It’s the task of trying to get attention in a deep sea of other amazing games. In the case of <em>Silksong</em>, however, I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale. Tiny devs like me rely on word of mouth and streamers to bring in visibility, and everyone’s gonna be busy with <em>Silksong</em> for quite a while!</p><p>Even with these delays, early September is still packed with notable game releases, including Necrosoft Games’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1900250%2FDemonschool%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Demonschool</em></a> (September 3rd), Rogue Factor’s <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-US/hell-is-us?srsltid=AfmBOopyqoJA7xkXuNy6kkA0Y7NrJpCZgYeUYqUce5c3lw90_m77bDYL"><em>Hell is Us</em></a> (September 4th), and Bloober Team’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272787/bloober-gets-bloody-in-its-next-game"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> (September 5th). We’ve reached out to the developers of those games to ask if they are changing their release plans because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">of <em>Silksong</em></a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 22nd</strong>: Added the delay for the demo of </em>Stomp and the Sword of Miracles<em>.</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/764346/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-game-delays-cloverpit-faeland-aeterna-lucis]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I did not expect to meet Mozart in Shovel Game, nor did I expect him to ask me to mine a pyramid of shit, with the helpful advice that I start at the top to avoid any floating shitbricks. Mozart is probably the least interesting thing about Shovel Game, actually.</p>
<p>It's a shortform first-person oddity with Minecraft-style destructible voxels (yes I know Minecraft doesn't really use voxels) and a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-half-life-the-5-a-m">AHL_5am</a>. The idea is to tunnel through "a sequence of strange and unfamiliar spaces". Here's a trailer.

<p>Only certain blocks can be mined, and you'll want to dig with caution, because the catacombs are full of groaning, wailing sprites that look like Zordon from Power Rangers. It's as if somebody had cracked the glass on his energy tube, freeing the galactic wizard's blobby visage to wander the Earth in pain. Enemies kill you on contact and I've yet to discover any weapons, just my trusty shovel and an 8-ball - purpose unknown.
</p><p>It's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3869670/Shovel_Game/">Steam</a>, but you can find <a href="https://lukewasthefish.itch.io/shovel-game">a demo on Itch.io</a>. Expect plenty of aggravation: there's a labyrinth full of oozy blue phantoms that requires fast footwork. Also a kind of cosmic chapel full of what appear to be flattened babies. The developer is Luke Vincent, who created it for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-002/entries">"shovelware horror" gamejam</a>, ho ho.</p>
<p>Bonus game mention: leafing through the submissions page for that jam, I discover a new work from Mike Klubnika, architect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-mike-klubnika">S.p.l.i.t.</a>, which Nic had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/split-review">eloquent emotions about</a>. Co-developed with James Dornan, Klubnika's jam game is called <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/crank-it">Crank It</a> and is about being stuck behind a set of gadgets in a cavernous hallway, trying to spot horrible creatures. Got to say, this sounds far worse than shit pyramid Mozart.</p>

He, like most of us who spend years improving our craft, looks back at older work and wishes he could iron out some of the wrinkles.

Instead, </span><i><span>Delta</span></i><span> primarily reuses the 20-year-old recordings from the original. However, Hayter and Alan did hop back in the booth to update some lines for the game’s tutorials. Hayter says that while he’s always down to play Snake again, he wishes Konami would let him re-record his whole performance after gaining 20 more years of acting experience.</span></p> <p><span>“I do feel that I’m a little better of an actor now than I was then,” Hayter told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span>. “It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I’ve picked up over the past 20 years to it. But you don’t want the [new tutorial] lines to be better acted all of a sudden, because that’ll take you out of the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While Hayter’s involvement in the remake was small, he’s hopeful this means the series is making a comeback after it went on ice following director Hideo Kojima’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/report-kojima-finally-leaves-konami-to-start-his-own-s-1748162428"><span>departure from Konami</span></a><span> in 2015, the laughably misguided survival game </span><i><span>Metal Gear Survive</span></i><span> in 2018 notwithstanding.</span></p> <p><span>“Anytime they ask me to be Snake, I’m in,” Hayter told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span>. “It’s the definitive role in my life. It’s so complex and so profound, and there are so many different aspects to both him and Big Boss. So anytime it comes up, I’m down.”</span></p> <p><span>For more on the </span><i><span>Snake Eater </span></i><span>remake, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><span>check out </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Super Meat Boy 3D is just as frustrating, just as hair-pulling and soul-destroying, and just as fun as the original—maybe more. Super Meat Boy Forever shifted the focus from freedom and autonomy to auto-running, a move that proved divisive. Super Meat Boy 3D gives you back control and adds more dynamic gameplay, and I had a blast playing it at Gamescom 2025 in an early Super Meat Boy 3D preview.</p>



<p>Everything you play Super Meat Boy for is here: Trap-filled levels, instant restarts, and an embarrassingly high death counter. The foundation of the game remains the same, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-meatboy-3d-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>‘s new perspective is a total shift. The game maintains a constant 45-degree side angle, and Sluggerfly and Team Meat have devised a new way to create chaos, which ironically puts things into perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-deadly-good-time">A Deadly Good Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beat the game without dying, I dare you. Credit to Head Up Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>My experience of the original <a href="https://sluggerfly.com/smb3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Meat Boy</a> and other difficult platformers lulled me into a false sense of security early on when I played the demo. I completed the first two or three stages without dying, but I was bracing myself for the inevitable, brutal storm—which arrived very quickly.</p>



<p>More mechanics were introduced, more dangers were thrown at me, and the death count shot up quicker than a person out of bed with a delivery driver at the door. Like I said, it’s still Super Meat Boy. But the 3D element is fascinating and genuinely creates a whole new way to play the game. You can run around obstacles, and you need to be more precise than ever.</p>



<p>There’s also more happening on screen. Where the original would generally throw individual dangers at you, SMB 3D requires you to survey the area, see which traps are hidden, and plan ahead—all at the same time. You can face several dangers in one passage of time. The platforming itself remains as tight and intricate as ever, and levels require multiple playthroughs to beat (let alone master).</p>



<p>I describe the Super Meat Boy games as a constant learning curve. The difficulty is always scaling. The first few levels were an obvious indicator of this, but whenever I died, I wanted to start over straight away. The controls and setup—from what I played—are the same, and it’s largely a one-button game. The same input allows SMB to jump, wall jump, etc, but the Dash from Super Meat Boy Forever returns!</p>



<p>This simple maneuver gives you a buffer to clear long spaces or help you if you mistime a jump, but it’s also a crucial move required to string together sequences of jumps, falls, dashes (and even more deaths).</p>



<p>3D also brings the world to life in new ways. Aside from the on-screen action, I had fun checking out the extended scenery. It adds more character, quality, and polish to an addictive gameplay loop. Super Meat Boy 3D’s original identity is back, but refreshed in a simple yet effective way. It’s going to be an instant buy from me when it comes out, and I can’t wait to see what other traps and terrors the development team adds to the game before launch.</p>

            <p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has stepped down from his position after over two decades at the studio.</p>
<p>Parsons has been much-criticised by fans and employees alike in recent years, in particular following multiple rounds of layoffs at the studio. In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">public statement</a>, Parsons said he's "decided to pass the torch" - an ironic use of words when Bungie has seemingly been up in flames.</p>
<p>Parsons will be succeeded as CEO by Justin Truman, who's spent 15 years at Bungie across both Destiny games and, more recently, forthcoming live-service shooter Marathon.</p>

<p>"I am deeply proud of the worlds we've built together and the millions of players who call them home - and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie," wrote Parsons in his statement.</p><p>"When I was asked to lead Bungie in 2015, my goal was to grow us into a studio capable of creating and sustaining iconic, generation-spanning entertainment. We've been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live-ops organisation capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment."</p>
<p>Parsons also leaves hundreds of layoffs and negative player sentiment in his wake, not to mention an infamous penchant for classic cars.</p>
<p>Even before Bungie's acquisition by Sony, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-apologies-after-damning-report-exposes-a-culture-of-overt-sexism-at-the-studio">reports emerged in 2021 of workplace toxicity and "overt sexism" at the studio</a>, for which <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/50895">Parsons apologised</a>. "I am not here to refute or to challenge the experiences we're seeing shared today by people who have graced our studio with their time and talent," he said at the time. "Our actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain. I apologise personally and on behalf of everyone at Bungie who I know feels a deep sense of empathy and sadness reading through these accounts."</p>
<p>Then in February 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony acquired Bungie for $3.6bn</a>, ostensibly to assist with its live-service ambitions. Though the acquisition was met with criticism by some - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-opens-probe-into-sonys-acquisition-of-bungie">FTC, for instance, opened an investigation</a> - others were more positive.</p>
<p>In 2024, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-general-counsel-says-sony-forced-the-studio-to-fix-the-things-that-were-wrong-with-their-game">Bungie's former chief in-house lawyer Don McGowan</a> said Sony was "inflicting some discipline" on the studio to "run the game like a business". "To be clear: I'm not talking about the layoffs, I'm talking about forcing them to get their heads out of their asses and focus on things like: implementing a method of new player acquisition; not just doing fan service for the fans in the Bungie C-suite; and running the game like a business," said McGowan.</p><p>However, a year after the acquisition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-warned-employees-of-sharp-drop-in-destiny-2-popularity-prior-to-layoffs">Bungie laid off 100 employees</a> - approximately eight percent of its 1200-strong workforce - after management warned staff revenue for the year was significantly below expectations. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">employees were left anxious about the future of the company</a>, amid claims senior management met employees' sadness at the layoffs with "indifference or even outright flippancy or hostility".</p>
<p>Parsons followed the news with a <a href="https://x.com/pparsons/status/1719083847680459207">statement on social media</a>, calling it a "sad day at Bungie". The statement was heavily criticised as tone deaf and a "slap in the face to anyone impacted by the layoffs".</p>
<p>A year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Bungie laid off a further 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of the studio's workforce. Between both rounds, Bungie laid off around a quarter of its workforce in nine months, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-leadership-reportedly-overstated-studios-financial-prospects-to-sony-leading-to-need-for-layoffs">company reportedly overstating its financial prospects to Sony</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">Current and former Bungie employees called that second round of layoffs "inexcusable"</a>, amid calls for Parsons to resign. "Pete is a joke," said former global social media lead Griffin Bennet (who was laid off in the previous cuts), while former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> community manager Liana Ruppert wrote, "Step down, Pete."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Parsons also faced criticism from staff for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a> since the studio was acquired by Sony, and bragging about his lavish collection ahead of job losses. The CEO's public profile on Bring a Trailer revealed he'd appeared to spend $2,414,550 on vehicles.</p>

<p>Fans shared a similar sentiment against Parsons. Noted Destiny content creator MyNameIsByf (AKA Lore Daddy) posted on X: "Leadership needs to be changed. Their decisions have consistently led to disaster for everyone who has actually been making the games we play. They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises. The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."</p>
<p>Now, Parsons is out, leaving Truman in charge. "I have worked alongside Justin for many years," he wrote. "His passion for our games, our team, and our players is unmatched."</p>
<p>Truman himself added to the statement with refreshing honesty, admitting previous mistakes made during Destiny 2's launch. "I've also been part of these efforts at Bungie when we've maybe not been at our best," he wrote. "When we've stumbled and realised through listening to our community that we had missed the mark. I know I've personally learned a lot over the years, as have all of us here, from those conversations."</p><p>He continued: "I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them."</p>
<p>Bungie continues to work on Destiny 2, while its next release will be Marathon. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Marathon gameplay was finally shown back in April</a>, in June <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Bungie delayed the game indefinitely</a> in response to "passionate" fan feedback. Ahead of the decision, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie staff morale was said to be in "free fall"</a> as it grappled with the fallout over Marathon assets stolen from other artists.</p>
<p>While such endemic toxicity and poor management cannot, of course, be pinpointed to one person, Bungie is clearly at a critical point in its history. Let's hope this shift in CEO will boost morale at the studio ahead of Marathon's eventual release - and whatever is next for Bungie.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"One of the reasons why we brought in a lot of fresh meat--all the new, younger developers--is because, not only did we want to give them a chance to figure out how to create and develop a Metal Gear game, but also give them a chance to experience the game themselves,” Okamura said to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/metal-gear-solid-producers-training-new-devs-continue-series-1235410797/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>. "And we’ll still be here for a while, but right now the goal is to build a team that could carry on the legacy on our behalf and could produce, hopefully in the future, more exciting games."</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is designed to be a bridge for that idea, as Okamura and Korekado view it as having the potential to reenergize the franchise and draw in new creators. Korekado explained that the seasoned developers working on the game were able to incorporate feedback from younger members on the team that would help modernize the game, while still retaining the original elements that made this entry in the series so captivating when it was first released in the 2000s.</p><p>The future of Metal Gear Solid is also one that will likely not involve series creator Hideo Kojima, as following his exit from Konami, the industry legend has been busy with multiple projects at his studio, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/">Death Stranding and its sequel</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6533769/">OD</a>, and a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/">Phsyint</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-his-new-game-is-now-in-crunch-time-wonders-how-much-longer-he-can-stay-creative/1100-6528760/">Kojima has also spoken</a> about how all the demanding work of creating a video game has begun to take a mental and physical toll on him as he grows older, but he still plans to remain as creative for as long as possible--or at least until he becomes the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-to-be-the-first-person-to-make-a-game-in-space/1100-6532868/">first person to make a game in space</a>. He's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">not planning to play Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 28, and we gave it a 9/10 in our review. "Konami's Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is a safe but successful modernization of a beloved classic," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review</a>.</p>

                <p>2017's Hollow Knight just reached a new all-time peak concurrent-player record on Steam, and the achievement came just after developer Team Cherry announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/" data-ref-id="1100-6534159">release date for its sequel, Silksong.</a></p><p>Hollow Knight reached an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all-time peak concurrent record of 23,819 on Steam today, August 22</a>. Measuring a game's popularity by Steam concurrent numbers is never a perfect or complete encapsulation of a game's popularity, and Hollow Knight being an exclusively single-player game that doesn't rely on people playing at the same time muddies the waters as well. But what is evident here is that Hollow Knight's popularity on Steam is growing in the wake of the big Silksong reveal.</p>

                <p>In the menagerie of 1990s animal video game mascots, Bubsy might rank somewhere between Aero the Acrobat and Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures (the latter having a small resurgence last year with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/rocket-knight-re-sparked-collection-pre-order-trailer/2300-6464045/" data-ref-id="2300-6464045">rerelease of the Sega Genesis games</a>). Now it's Bubsy's turn to get a new spin for a new decade in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bubsy-returns-in-a-new-3d-platformer-this-is-not-a-joke/1100-6534082/" data-ref-id="1100-6534082">Bubsy 4D</a>, and it actually looks good.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fabraz.bsky.social/post/3lwwc5ndsvk2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, the developer Fabraz showed off more of the game's mechanics, switching Bubsy back and forth from his hairball form, dashing through obstacles, then back to regular form, climbing and clawing his way over walls and other nefarious traps. The cel-shaded colors pop and set it apart from the other games in the franchise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4bq6P8e5gk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H4bq6P8e5gk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The wise-cracking bobcat is returning to his platforming roots after 2019's auto-runner, Bubsy: Paws on Fire, but this time he's not taking on the Woolies but an army of sheep robots: The BaaBots. Bubsy 4D also includes a customizable wardrobe, including the Bubsy 3D skin.</p><p>So it appears they've cranked up Bubsy's speed a bit, seemingly giving it a more Sonic Frontiers feel. "The team at Fabraz crafted this expressive new moveset to cater to beginners and speedrun enthusiasts alike," the official release says. "Once you've mastered Bubsy’s clawsome new moves, show off your skills by uploading your best level times to the online leaderboards for other players to race against!"</p><p>There's no official release date yet, but you can wishlist it now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and it will be available on every major platform.</p>
