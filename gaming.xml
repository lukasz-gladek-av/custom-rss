			<p>Gamescom 2024 was a crucial step for Dune Awakening. Funcom finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the early 2025 release window (for PC, with consoles to come later) and showed off the first solid chunk of gameplay in a presentation posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>The developer also allowed the press to get their hands on the game for the first time, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity, having been waiting for Dune Awakening since its announcement.</p>
<p>The first impact was harsh in the sense that Arrakis showed its teeth right away. The demo didn't have a tutorial, so we were basically dropped into the desert without much guidance. Even so, it didn't take long to figure out that the player character doesn't last long without water. Initially, you need to extract water from plants, although that only works up to a point. You also have to be mindful of not staying too long in the sun, lest you gain a rebuff called sunstroke, which accelerates the rate at which your water level depletes.</p>
<p>As with any survival game, harvesting is very important in Dune Awakening, too. To spice things up, Funcom has added a sort of mini-game to cutting metals. The cutter analyzes a structure to find its weak points, and you'll then have to aim the cutter accordingly to get the best mining efficiency.</p>
<p>It wasn't long until I stumbled into an NPC outpost. At this point, the developer who was overseeing demo stations 'cheated' to unlock certain skills on our characters, such as the Shigawire grappling hook and the suspension belt. Between this and the freeform climbing, it is possible to approach an enemy base from various angles.</p>
<p>Combat felt pretty good, although there is room for improvement in the next few months. Graphically, I was expecting a bit more from the game. While Lumen's lighting prowess was on full display, the sharpness wasn't great. However, I quickly learned from the graphics settings that the display resolution was set to 1080p, which would have explained my perception. The low resolution may have been picked for the demo due to ongoing performance optimization. The full game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> NVIDIA DLSS 3, by the way.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed my brief time with Dune Awakening, even though many questions lingered in my mind. Thankfully, to answer some of those, I subsequently interviewed Chief Product Officer Scott Junior. You can read the full transcript below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening – Gamescom Gameplay Presentation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J18oH_FBDYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let us start with the announcement of the release window. Why did you choose to lead with PC and delay the console launch?</strong></p>
<p>So, PC development is right within our wheelhouse, given our background. We wanted to make sure that we gave the console platforms the timing it takes to do optimizations, making sure that the controller is working properly, the interface and all that. So, we're starting with Steam right there and PC, and then we will add more content and prepare for the launch of the other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>But it's not going to be an early access launch, right?</strong></p>
<p>That is not the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the other platforms like consoles, can you share whether you plan to have crossplay eventually when Dune Awakening launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of that has to do with the actual platforms themselves and our discussions with them. We have not come through it on that yet so I can't say for sure.</p>
<p><strong>When I played the game at the Funcom booth, no controller was available. Will that be supported for the PC launch?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. If you see there on the screen right now, we have controller onscreen prompts. We just had a keyboard and mouse for the Gamescom demo to streamline the experience. However, the game is already fully playable with a controller. We designed all the UIs with the controller in mind, we designed the interactions and the player's abilities accordingly. Unlike in some games where you have an infinite amount of keys to pressure, we designed everything to fit with the controller as well.</p>
<p><strong>I believe there are three active abilities in total, correct?</strong></p>
<p>You have attack, parry, dodge, sprint, and all those things. In addition to that, you can map the three active abilities from the different archetypes in the game. You start out Dune Awakening with one archetype, and then you need to go out and meet other masters who can teach you the other archetypes. The player creates their own class by selecting abilities and techniques from those archetypes.</p>
<p><strong>So you can mix any skill from any class in any way, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Whether it's the Bene Gesserit, Swordmasters, Mentats, or Troopers, you can unlock those and mix them however you want to do to create your own kit, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>The Gamescom demo dropped us right in the middle of the action with no tutorial, making it confusing at first, but then it was fairly easy to pick up what you needed to do. Of course, the survival focus is strong initially, but I'm wondering how much emphasis you plan to keep on survival elements later on. Will those be important even after 30 hours of gameplay?</strong></p>
<p>For the initial survival experience, we're really focused on water. It's Dune; it's Arrakis. Water is an incredibly rare and valuable resource there and you need it when you're starting out just to survive. That survival pressure will lessen with water specifically when you start getting a stillsuit and better tools.</p>
<p>However, you will be introduced to new mechanics like adding a sandbike or an ornithopter. Those are some of the more advanced things that you can build, and they put different pressures on you. Eventually, as you are on Arrakis, you will be introduced to spice pressure, whether it's from using it to pay out the guild, using it to bolster your abilities, or simply to counteract your addiction. That pressure will continue to increase. So, when you get more tools, you can gather things quicker, but there will be new types of pressure in the late game.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have a couple of different party-type systems. Your normal group would be a party of four, and then you can have a larger group, a party of sixteen or four groups, which would be like a raid or a strike group. I don't think we have come out and set the exact term on that yet.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I noticed that on the map, I could see another party listed as having four players. How big is the party size in Dune Awakening?</strong></p>
<p>We have a couple of different party-type systems. Your normal group would be a party of four, and then you can have a larger group, a party of sixteen or four groups, which would be like a raid or a strike group. I don't think we have come out and set the exact term on that yet.</p>
<p>We have different content for solo players and party players. Large groups could be doing a big spice harvesting operation, using several vehicles and coordinating in planning out logistics and building bases.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan to balance it so that very large guilds don't completely dominate the field?</strong></p>
<p>Large guilds will require large amounts of resources to do what they need to do, while solo players will require way less. While a solo player cannot do the exact activity in the same way as a larger group, they're still going to be able to interact in those activities in different ways, whether it's sneaking onto a harvester and stealing spice out of that and then running away or trying to steal ships or ornithopters from players. It will be hard, but we want to make sure that this is accessible whether you're solo or not.</p>
<p><strong>I'm thinking especially of small guilds. Lots of players tend to have a small guild with five to ten friends. Will they still be able to join these PvP fights and have a chance?</strong></p>
<p>Of course. We expect, especially late-game interactions, to often be in an unfair amount of numbers given that you're in an uncontrolled environment, right? We're not a session-based game where you're always 16 versus 16; it's a sandbox where you're going to have a group of one or a group of sixteen, so we've tried to make ways where people can deploy techniques or tools to alert them when other players are coming. There are also ways for people to get out of the fight and disengage in a fight they don't want to participate in.</p>
<p><strong>There is a penalty for dying in the Deep Desert, right?</strong></p>
<p>We're still working on the balance for that, but generally, when you die, you lose some credits and then the spice that you have on you.</p>
<p><strong>What about PvE content? I know you've talked about the underground laboratories.</strong></p>
<p>Yep, the Eco Labs. Our survival map and the Deep Desert have a couple of different types of PvE content. The first one is what you said, the Eco Labs. These are ecological testing stations where the environment is very different from the normal sand and rocks that you have on Dune, so there'll be different plants, different animals, and things like that down there.</p>
<p>And each of them tells a different story when you're going down into something that hasn't been explored in quite a long time. We also have shipwrecks, both dynamic and static shipwrecks of these large, massive crashed ships that create a dungeon-like experience.</p>
<p><strong>Usually, in most MMOs, you gather a group for a specific boss fight to get specific loot. Can players have that kind of experience in Dune Awakening?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Eco Labs are that kind of experience. I mean, comparing it to a dungeon, an MMORPG dungeon, it's not a one-to-one like copy or instance of that, but there will be NPCs that you're encountering, encounters that you're fighting throughout it, and then there'll be a culmination, whether it's a boss fight or something that you need to do at the end of it to get some rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Does the game support different roles for players, like support builds, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>It is not concretely defined like that. However, there are abilities that are more damaging and others that are more supportive. It won't be exactly like a dedicated healer, but yeah, there are ways to prevent some damage from being dealt to your teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a concept of aggro or threat in PvE?</strong></p>
<p>In some ways, yeah. Not as clear as in a traditional MMORPG where you have like taunting, but there will be ways to have NPCs attack you.</p>
<p><strong>Is there some loot exclusive to Eco Labs, or do you plan to allow all loot to be craftable?</strong></p>
<p>Each Eco Lab will have its own loot table. One of the differences is that a lot of these are going to be limited-run schematics that you use to craft unique versions of things that you have. These will be items that, again, are unique with unique effects compared to what you can craft regularly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'When we launch, we have a story and a journey that the player goes through. It comes to a conclusion in our first post-launch update, which will have new story content and an extension to the storyline between the Atreides and the Harkonnen, the introduction of new NPCs, new contracts, and new journeys for the player.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Dune Awakening seems like a live service type of game. Moving to the future, post-launch, what kind of post-release content can players expect?</strong></p>
<p>When we launch, we have a story and a journey that the player goes through. It comes to a conclusion in our first post-launch update, which will have new story content and an extension to the storyline between the Atreides and the Harkonnen, the introduction of new NPCs, new contracts, and new journeys for the player to go through. We'll also be adding new Eco Labs, new vehicles, and new mechanics for the survival regions of the map.</p>
<p><strong>Your game director, Joel Bylos, said that the way you structured the world makes it easier to add more zones in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Once you get an ornithopter, you're able to leave the survival map, the Hagga Basin, and there you can go and explore the overland map, which is all of Arrakis. Post-launch, we will be adding new exploration spots and new maps that you can go into, which will offer new survival experiences and new story content.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the game will favor ranged combat, or will it be fully balanced with melee?</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to support both. We use the shield mechanic that's famous in the lore, which is that slow bullets penetrate the shield. There will be times when the player needs to combine both melee and ranged with their abilities to win, so you can make a well-rounded character that covers everything.</p>
<p><strong>I know that when you create your character, you can select your background and stuff like that. How will it play into the story?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. When you're interacting with the NPCs, they will react to you on what your background is. Whether you're coming from a noble house or whether you were a slave. It's not every single NPC, but there will be quite a few branching paths based on your background.</p>
<p>It's not going to have any impact on the gameplay, combat, or anything like that. That is mostly based on the trainer you select from the background and then those you unlock throughout the game.</p>
<p><strong>In the endgame, you have the Landsraad system, right? With your guild, you side with either the Atreides or the Harkonnen. How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>The Landsraad system, from a high level, is the endgame where guilds fight against other guilds sworn to the other faction across the entire game world. They will be fighting for the same objectives and then at the end, whichever faction wins, it's a server-wide reward for everybody that participated in.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so the battle between Atreides and Harkonnen resets at some point.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, there's different phases that happen, whether once every week or once every month, but yeah, there would be the battle phase where you're not fighting, but you're fighting over objectives to complete those. Then, for whoever wins, there will be a council meeting, and you're selecting what the rewards will be for the victor, whether it's access to unique content or something else.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'For whoever wins between Atreides and Harkonnen, there will be a council meeting, and you're selecting what the rewards will be for the victor, whether it's access to unique content or something else. Then it resets.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I believe you said previously that even PvE players can participate.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, everybody will be on it.</p>
<p><strong>I know you're starting with these two factions, but do you plan to add more factions from the lore at some point?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. We're not ready to talk about that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to have a larger Dune Awakening Beta later this year?</strong></p>
<p>We're in a relatively small closed beta right now. We expect to expand that over the next couple of months with more people, so the beta will grow exponentially. We're continuing to invite more people who signed up for the beta from our official website.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think there will be a full open Beta before the early 2025 launch?</strong></p>
<p>We're not ready to talk about that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Spiders, <a href="https://www.spiders-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio behind</a> GreedFall, has responded to the public allegations made by the Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des<br>Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo (STJV)) and employees at Spiders.</p>



<p>In a statement to Insider Gaming, the studio says that the accusations made by the STJV are “false and even defamatory”. They go on to say that they don’t “reflect the reality” of working for the company.</p>



<p>“The false and even defamatory accusations made by the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company’s employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access release of GreedFall 2,” a spokesperson for the studio said.</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that there were “unsuccessful attempts” to meet with employees, but a meeting has been proposed for the end of the week.</p>



<p>“Spiders’ management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue,” the company said. “After unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees, they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week. </p>



<p>“Spiders’ employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of which we can all be proud.”</p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spiders-developers-to-strike-over-mismanagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 20-page letter was made public</a> by the STJV outlining multiple complaints against the studio. Some of those complaints included allegations of employee mismanagement, delays in gender equality, employment instability, and more. </p>



<p>The developers within the union have announced plans to strike on September 2-3.</p>

<p>Activision held its CODNext event on Wednesday afternoon, giving players the full reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For Warzone, specifically, the new map Area 99 was revealed for the first time ahead of its debut later this year along with new features for the mode.</p>

<h2 id="h-area-99-and-new-warzone-features">Area 99 And New Warzone Features</h2>



<p>Area 99 is the new Resurgence Map in Warzone that is based on the history of Nuketown. Nuketown, of course, is the classic multiplayer map that debuted in the original Black Ops in 2010.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Area 99 features 10 main areas. The main area in the center is the Reactor area while nine others circle around it. According</p>



<p>Aside from the new map, Warzone will get a number of new features later this year. Those features start with the addition of Onmimovement with Season 1. </p>

<p>Other things to know about the mode this year are the lack of backpacks, tactical sprint being available when wielding knives, wildcards such as Gunfighter and Overkill, and the removal of the Guardian and Mosquito Drone.</p>



<p>Regarding perks, there’s a new perk system for players that features a new “Pick 3” perk with 18 perks in total. There will also be six available in ground loot with season 1. Those six perks include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Veteran </li>



<li>Dexterity </li>



<li>Tracker</li>



<li>Cold Blooded </li>



<li>Tempered</li>



<li>Alertness</li>



<li>Specialist</li>
</ul>



<p>It was also confirmed that, starting with Season 1, players will be able to use weapons from Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, and Modern Warfare 2 in Warzone. </p>

                <p>The new Resurgence map coming to Call of Duty: Warzone in time for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>--Area 99--just might be the coolest concept for a Call of Duty map in years. This is where Nuketown was born, quite literally, as the map is set on a remote testing facility that acts as a manufacturing center for Nuketowns--yes, plural--as well as some more nefarious products.</p><p>Area 99 is designed to tell the origin story of Nuketown, and in keeping with the tradition of that map, it's meant to encourage faster engagements. Alongside a manufacturing facility for the houses, there is a nuclear reactor, a mannequin-assembly center, a pod dormitory for workers, and an underground bunker. That bunker is of particular interest, as it is connected to every other POI and should lead to some unexpected ambushes. There is also a "sneaky zipline" in the Nuketown manufacturing area, though Treyarch didn't let slip where that is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-ultimate-wireless-esports-controller-the-razer-wolverine-v3-pro-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-launches-blade-18-intel-core-i9-14900hx-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-thunderbolt-5/">Razer</a> unveiled its latest controller, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, which is slated as the "ultimate wireless Esports controller. " Made using cutting-edge technology, this controller is officially licensed by Xbox, with extensive play testing and feedback from Eric "Snip3down" Wrona, a 2-time X Games medalist and 24-time Halo champion. With Wrona's approval and feedback, the controller is set to aid those who play games competitively with advanced customization, fast, responsive inputs, and ergonomics.</p>
<p>The controller features four mouse click-back paddles, two claw grip bumpers, Razer Pro HyperTriggers, Hall Effect precision thumbsticks, and Razer HyperSpeed Wireless connectivity to give gamers a seamless, comfortable experience.</p>
<p>Team Razer is already expansive, but it now includes Eric Wrona, the first controller-using esports competitor to join the team. His feedback is vital to the creation of the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro. "The Wolverine V3 Pro's intuitive design and customizable features provide a significant competitive edge. It's the undeniable choice for anyone serious about winning," says Eric Wrona.</p>
<p>The controller utilizes Hall Effect Thumbsticks, which are similar to traditional thumbsticks but come with advanced technology such as Anti-friction rings and top-tier materials to ensure that they don't wear down quickly and have long-lasting durability.</p>
<p>In addition, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro also comes with the Razer Controller app, which allows users to customize their experience further. By using this app, players can find the precision filters that work for them and customize their Dead Zones to fit the needs of the game they're playing.</p>
<p>The Wireless Razer Wolverine V3 Pro uses a USB Type-A Dongle which you can fit into a USB slot on your device, allowing you to play with a seamless connection using a 2.4 Ghz connection on either your Xbox or PC. If you're worried about your controller getting dirty, the accessory comes with its very own carrying case which holds the controller, two replacement thumbstick caps, the wireless dongle and a 10ft cable, making the controller as portable as needs be so you can take it to tournaments and competitions without worrying about it getting scuffed or dirty in your bag.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If the wireless version isn't for you, Razer has also announced the wired version of the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition, which has all of the same features as this controller but allows you to have a consistent wired connection.</p>
<p>If you're interested in this professional eSports controller, you can purchase it on the <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer store</a> for $199.99. Alternatively, if you'd like the wired version, the price is $99.99.</p>

<p>Treyarch has revealed additional details about the Black Ops 6 Zombies through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brzOBsdEAf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CODNext</a> Showcase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-black-ops-6-zombies-maps-available-at-launch">2 Black Ops 6 Zombies Maps Available at Launch</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies will launch with two maps, Liberty Falls and Terminus Island, featuring the return of round-based gameplay. In the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls, players will find a “built-out world” that highlights stories of people who once lived there. Moreover, there will be some side quests as well across both maps.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Zombies devs embraced the 90s and the nostalgia in Liberty Falls, bringing elements such as a comic shop, a video store, a bowling alley, and more to this world. Additionally, the vibes of Liberty Falls and Terminus are very different, with the former feeling deceptively safe at first and the latter being dark and gloomy throughout.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The developers unveiled some new toys players can play with in Black Ops 6 Zombies. First is&nbsp;the Thrustodyne M23, which will help you quickly mow down the undead. Another addition is the Zombies Wunderwaffe DG-2, ready to shock anyone that comes your way. Players can also supercharge their Dedicated Melee option with the new Melee Macchiato, available at Perk Machines around the map.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will also find unique traps on each map, so you should “Trigger the Aetherella Trap in the Liberty Falls Comic Shop or Dark Aether Field Trap to leave a special surprise for our decaying friends”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-additional-update-and-quality-of-life-improvements-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Additional Update and Quality of Life Improvements in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, improvements such as save and quit in solo matches, joining a friend’s match progress at any time, and pausing solo matches will be available for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Also, the developers revealed that Door costs can now be shared between players, armour can be purchased through Wall Buys in Terminus Island and Liberty Falls, player-specific drops will be introduced, and self-revive will be limited to 3.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn’t a game you play because you want to experience the most innovative open world. It’s not full of ideas that will shake up the genre, and its structure and gameplay can get pretty repetitive. In a lot of ways, it’s standard stuff. But for a certain kind of player, none of that will matter. Because what makes <em>Outlaws</em> notable is the <em>Star Wars</em> part — it’s an average open-world game but an incredible <em>Star Wars</em> simulator.</p><p>The game takes place between the events of <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em> and puts players in the role of Kay Vess, a low-level criminal who gets in way over her head very quickly. She’s a wise-cracking Han Solo type with an adorable companion named Nix who is half puppy, half axolotl. The setup is a cliche crime caper: Kay joins a crew to pull off one huge score, with plans to retire safely on all the cash she’s about to steal. Things go sideways, and not only is Kay left penniless — she has also pissed off an incredibly rich and powerful member of the criminal underworld. Whoops!</p><p>From there, the story takes an interesting turn, and the rest of the game is spent preparing for another crack at the loot. That means Kay has to build up her underworld credentials by taking on jobs, find a crew that can help pull off the heist successfully, and generally improve her skills and gear for a better shot. It’s a fun premise that works well with the open-world structure, ensuring everything you do in the game is building toward a big payoff at the end.</p><p>Perhaps the most unique thing about the game is the way factions work. There are four criminal syndicates you’ll be dealing with, and your status with them will change over the course of the game depending on what you do. Taking on a mission to appease the Crimson Dawn might piss off their rivals, for instance, and dealing with them all can feel like spinning plates. Getting in the good graces of a gang opens up new mission paths and other opportunities, while angering them can make certain areas off limits and — if things get really bad — have them attack you on sight. It doesn’t fundamentally change the game, but the structure does force you to make some interesting and occasionally tough decisions about whose side you’re on.</p><div><p><h4>A word on Nix</h4></p><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t talk about Nix. No new <em>Star Wars</em> story is complete without a cuddly animal or droid, Kay’s adorable companion is arguably the most memorable part of <em>Outlaws</em>. Not only is he cute, but helpful; the little guy can distract enemies and cameras, flip hard-to-reach switches, and aid in fights. Plus, you can head to certain food vendors and share a meal with Nix, which involves an incredibly indulgent minigame that is just the cutest. (Animals are a highlight of the game, as you can pet all kinds of intergalactic critters.)</p></div><p>Much like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the <em>Star Wars Jedi</em> series</a>, if you’re simply looking to be taken to a galaxy far, far away, <em>Outlaws</em> is a great option. There’s nothing quite like racing across the deserts of Tatooine on a speeder bike or landing on a new planet and heading into the local cantina to ask around. All of the details — the visuals, the sound, the storylines — feel perfectly like, well, <em>Star Wars</em>. Like you’re in one of the movies, able to walk around and soak in the details.</p><p>I always love market scenes in fantasy and sci-fi; they’re a great way to quickly get a sense of the culture of a place at a glance. And I spent far too much time in <em>Outlaws</em> wandering around <a href="https://www.threads.net/@andrewwebster/post/C_IqhpAJuWh">snapping photos of street food vendors</a> and watching patrons in cantinas. It’s not only a way to feel immersed in <em>Star Wars</em> in a way that’s impossible in other mediums, but it often pays to linger; multiple times, I leaned against a wall on a crowded street, only to overhear details for an interesting side quest.</p><p>Part of what makes this work is how dense <em>Outlaws</em> is. As opposed to, say, <em>Starfield</em> or <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, sci-fi games that offer giant — but mostly empty — planets to explore, <em>Outlaws</em> is more practical in scale. There are a handful of worlds, and while each has some open expanses to drive through, most of your time is spent in cities, settlements, bases, and other detailed and busy spaces. This doesn’t make <em>Outlaws</em> feel small, but rather more human in scope. You don’t need to spend hours scouring through nothingness to feel like you’ve seen what the game has to offer.</p><p>The problem is that what you’re doing at any given moment is largely identical to every other open-world game of the last few years. The missions revolve around either sneaking into an enemy base to steal something or going somewhere to collect an item and return it. There’s lots of crawling through vents, disabling cameras and alarms, and shootouts with very dumb stormtroopers and criminal thugs. Sometimes, you have a choice for how you approach a mission — you might sneak in the back door, versus going in guns blazing — but mostly, the moment-to-moment action follows a familiar pattern.</p><p>As opposed to a game like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, where you have the tools to approach missions in inventive ways, in <em>Outlaws</em>, you’re largely following one of a handful of predetermined paths. Worse still, the game often forces you into specific modes, most notably some very tedious stealth sequences. It’s a structure seen across so many games in the genre, from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> to <em>Horizon</em> to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>; I was having <em>a lot</em> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> flashbacks during my playthrough.</p><p>How much you enjoy your time with <em>Outlaws</em> will depend on how much you want to live this fantasy. The underworld of <em>Star Wars</em> has always had some of the universe’s most interesting stories and characters, and here’s a chance to experience it all firsthand. That involves some plodding missions and conventional gameplay, which can be a tough sell if you’re burned out on open-world games already. But when you’re on edge infiltrating Jabba’s palace or enjoying the sights and sounds of the bustling Canto Bight, it’s easy to forget all of that for a few blissful moments.</p><p><small>Star Wars Outlaws <em>launches August 30th on the PC, Xbox, and PS5.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When Sonic and friends come knocking on his door, he’s let himself go and doesn’t seem that interested in world domination anymore, but still has enough robots and tech to give our heroes a fighting chance against Shadow, who is threatening to destroy the world. The good ol’ doctor doesn’t seem to have entirely moved beyond his villainous ways, however. He only agrees to help save the world on one condition: Robotnik wants one of Sonic’s superpowered quills, which our hero hesitantly gives him.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="79e2d0a6c87124ff9ec456ba0f7c2490" data-recommend-id="image://79e2d0a6c87124ff9ec456ba0f7c2490" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic towers over Sonic as he appears in Sonic Superstars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Sonic towers over Sonic as he appears in Sonic Superstars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79e2d0a6c87124ff9ec456ba0f7c2490" data-recommend-id="image://79e2d0a6c87124ff9ec456ba0f7c2490" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Metal Sonic towers over Sonic as he appears in Sonic Superstars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The theory is that the good doctor might use Sonic’s power source to create the live-action version of Metal Sonic. This robot replica has been a recurring antagonist throughout the franchise since his debut on <em>Sonic CD</em> in 1993. He’s meant to be a mechanical equal to Sonic under Robotnik’s control, though he’s gone rogue before and ended up a threat to both his rival and his creator. If Robotnik is looking for an edge in his plot to take over the world, having someone just as fast and strong as his archnemesis is a pretty logical move, and using one of his quills to power the thing makes a lot of sense.<br></p><p>Part of me is a little skeptical of this because the movies have already given Sonic a rival character in Shadow. Metal Sonic is full of his own complexities and insecurities surrounding his inability to defeat Sonic that are different from those of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208">Keanu Reeves’ brooding baddy</a></span>, but I can imagine <em>Sonic 4</em> feeling a bit samey if it’s two hedgehogs duking it out again like it will be in this movie. However, I could see Metal Sonic becoming a much bigger threat if the movies adapted parts of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-best-games-adventure-heroes-frontiers-generations-1851449449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-best-games-adventure-heroes-frontiers-generations-1851449449"><em>Sonic Heroes</em></a></span>. Metal Sonic was the twist villain of the 2003 game, and every hero, antihero, and villain had to team up to take him down after he became mad with power. If the movies loosely adapt that concept, Metal Sonic could become a Thanos-like figure in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe.

But the first trailer already shows that the movies aren’t entirely beholden to the same stories as the games, so there’s room for Paramount to find creative ways to bring these characters into the fold. My one worry about Metal Sonic is that he’d require the presence of Robotnik, so it seems contingent on whether or not Carrey would return for a fourth movie.

<p>The next game in the Witcher franchise is set to enter production soon. In a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-looks-back-at-the-first-half-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new statement</a> during its first half earnings report, CD Projekt Red join CEO Michal Nowakowsi said the the new Witcher game is close to leaving preproduction.</p>



<p>“Work on Polaris is progressing,” he said. “Its development team is nearing a major milestone which will mark the end of the preproduction phase.”</p>



<p>Currently, there are 410 people working Polaris — the codename for the next Witcher title. That’s just under 65% of the entire company. Back in January, Joint CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-polaris-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the goal</a> was to have over 400 people working on the game this year. As of June 30, that number has been reached.</p>



<p>Polaris is the beginning of a new Witcher saga that will span another new Trilogy for the series. It will also see, in some form, a continuation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-geralts-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt of Rivia’s story</a>. Other details about the game, however, are known just yet. </p>

Set in the heart of a Zombie outbreak, the map features VHS rental stores, cozy shops, and sidequests for players to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jswLipfg94" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7jswLipfg94" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each map will have its own unique weapon, and for Liberty Falls, players can equip a jet engine that can suck up zombies and shred them up into bloody chunks. There are also new traps, including a life-size action figure in the comic-book store that can fire heat-vision beams from its eyes and slice up any zombies inside.</p><p>This year's Zombies offering looks like a return to the basics of the popular mode, as players will have to deal with the undead menace in a traditional round-based format. There'll be two maps at launch--the small town of Liberty Falls and the Terminus prison--and players can expect a mode that'll make them sweat as they deal with hordes of enemies.</p><p>There are some interesting mutations to Zombies this year, and overall, Treyarch is aiming to make the mode feel rewarding while also growing the community of Zombies players. For example, the Essence currency can be used to unlock new routes of escape or spent on Perks to strengthen yourself against the ever-increasing challenge of the sprinting undead.</p><p>The other form of currency, Salvage, is found randomly from fallen enemies and can be spent on improving your equipment. Two big quality-of-life changes with Salvage are that you won’t have to worry about teammates picking up your loot, as it's players-specific and there's only type of Salvage now, compared to the normal and High-Grade Salvage that could be collected in Black Ops Cold War.</p><p>Another big change this year is the introduction of more movement options, as for the first time ever, players can sprint, slide, and dive in any direction while chaining combat maneuvers together. This is part of the Omnimovement system being introduced in Black Ops 6, which is one of the major upgrades to Call of Duty this year.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on Friday, October 25, for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. Game Pass subscribers will get access to the full game as part of their membership, but this doesn't apply to Game Pass Core or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-not-a-day-one-game-pass-release-for-the-new-tier/1100-6524833/" data-ref-id="1100-6524833">new Game Pass Standard tier</a> subscribers.

            <p>
Earlier this year, Chris Barrett, a senior figure at Bungie and the project lead on its Marathon reboot, was reported to have left the studio - and a new report has shed fresh light on his departure, claiming he was ousted after an internal investigation into inappropriate behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Back in March, IGN reported former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">taken over Barrett's role</a> on the Marathon reboot as part of a creative leadership shake-up at Bungie. Now, however, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claims Barrett was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior">fired from the studio this spring</a>, after being accused of inappropriate behaviour by "at least eight" female employees.
</p>
<p>
Speaking directly to some of the women who had originally filed complaints against Barrett, alongside a number of employees involved in Bungie's investigation, Bloomberg reports Barrett repeatedly befriended women at the studio then subjected them to "a barrage of text messages that blurred the lines between professional and personal". Texts seen by Bloomberg - described as "unwanted" and "uncomfortable" by the women that received them - included "flirtatious messages... and requests to hang out".

<p>
According to Schreier, Bungie's HR investigation ultimately found Barrett - who had been with the company since 1999 and worked as both an artist and game director prior to his departure - had "called lower-level female employees attractive, asked them to play truth-or-dare and made references to his wealth and power within the studio, suggesting that he could help advance their careers".
</p>
<p>
In a response provided to Bloomberg, Barrett said, "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's Marathon reboot, now helmed by Joe Ziegler, is currently expected to release next year. Bungie said the project was one of its key focuses, alongside Destiny, following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">lay off 220 staff</a> - around 17 percent of the studio's workforce - back in July. Those layoffs came after 100 job cuts last October, and saw many former and current Bungie employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">calling for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/september-2024-ps-plus-monthly-games-confirmed-quidditch-champions-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the monthly games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> in September 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include wizardly sports, American sports, and small person horrors.</p>
<p>Let’s see what they are!</p>


<h2>What are the PS Plus September 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 3rd September</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quidditch Champions</strong></li>
<li><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></li>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares II</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You know what you’re getting with MLB The Show, which is the most accurate and visually impressive game of baseball out there. Developed by San Diego Studio, this is a homegrown first party title, even if it’s no longer a PlayStation exclusive. So, as we come to the end of the MLB season, why not throw it onto PS Plus to gather as many interested players as possible?</p>
<p><iframe title="Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions – Official Trailer – 'Magic is in the Air'" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7b6P60X9xB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What’s a bit less known is what Quidditch Champions will really be like, as the game will join PS Plus on day one. A video game version of the wizarding sport from Harry Potter, the rules to this game have always been a bit of a joke for how massively overpowered catching the Golden Snitch is to winning a match. Still, you’ll be able to customise your character and play as a Chaser, Seeker, Beater and Keeper, and there will be both some broomstick adventures and competitive multiplayer.</p>


<p>And finally, with Little Nightmares III around the corner, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> is now a monthly game for PS Plus. Looking back on our review, Tuff said, “It’s rather obvious, but if you enjoyed the first Little Nightmares then you will enjoy the Little Nightmares II. While some new elements have been added it is more of a next chapter to the story than a full blown sequel. The attention detail is incredible, bringing the story to life without a single spoken word. It’s unsettling, creepy, darkly amusing, and at times a little frustrating, but immensely enjoyable. Another little, slime covered gem from Tarsier Studios.”</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the August 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab August’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 3rd September, so make sure to grab a pretty great Lego game while you can!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (PS4/PS5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach (PS4/PS5)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights (PS4)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The director behind Marathon at Bungie was fired this year due to inappropriate conduct. According to Bloomberg, Chris Barrett was fired from Bungie in the spring after being accused by “several female employees of inappropriate behavior”.</p>



<p>Per the report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, “at least” eight female employees came forward against Barrett to the company. From their an investigation took place. That investigation discovered that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth-or-dare. On top of that, Barrett reported flaunted his “wealth and power” within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>

<p>Messages that were sent to Schreier showed requests to hang out with the women involved as well as texts that were “flirtatious”. It was also said that Barrett’s interactions with the women had “similar patterns”.</p>



<p>“Barrett would befriend women at the studio in various departments and then send them a barrage of text messages that blurred the lines between professional and personal,” Schreier wrote.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Barrett apologized for making people feel uncomfortable while adding that was never his intention.</p>



<p>“I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends,”  he said. “I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.”</p>



<p>Schreier says that Sony, Bungie’s parent company, wouldn’t comment on the case. However, he was given a standard response from a spokesperson saying that the company takes all complaints of misconduct seriously.</p>



<p>Employees at Bungie weren’t told that Barrett was fired or why he was no longer with the company.</p>

Twelve of these maps will be core 6v6 alongside four Strike maps that can be played with 6v6 or 2v2.</p><p>The 16 brand-new maps announced for Black Ops 6 at launch are:</p><ul><li>Protocol</li><li>Rewind</li><li>Skyline</li><li>Lowtown</li><li>Subsonic</li><li>Scud</li><li>Redcard</li><li>Babylon</li><li>Derelict</li><li>Vorkuta</li><li>Vault</li><li>Sandhouse</li><li>Stakeout</li><li>Gala</li><li>Pit</li><li>Payback</li></ul><p>The 8 maps for the multiplayer beta are:</p><ul><li>Skyline</li><li>Scud</li><li>Rewind</li><li>Babylon</li><li>Derelict</li><li>Stakeout</li><li>Gala</li><li>Pit</li></ul><p>Kill Order--a combination of objective and slayer modes--is a new multiplayer mode for Black Ops 6. Each team will have their own high-value target, which will be the "key" to their victory. Each team will want to protect their high-value target while attacking the enemy's high-value target. Eliminations will count towards the team's score, and additional score is earned when a high-value target gets a kill or is eliminated by your team.</p><p>Being selected as the high-value target grants bonuses such as extra protection with armor plates and vision of enemies with indicators on the mini-map.</p><p>Black Ops 6 will also be bringing back objective zones in Domination, and Hardpoint now has added objective icons for easier team callouts.</p><p>Details on seasonal content are still secretive, but the Black Ops team mentions that fan-favorite maps in the series will make a comeback further down the line.

			<p>Call of Duty: NEXT Showcase is officially underway, and there, people will get to experience reveals of features from the upcoming shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-pc-requirements-revealed/">Early Access period</a> for the game isn't far away either, officially opening up to players in two days. Below is the official CODNEXT Showcase, which gives excited fans glimpses into the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="#CODNext Showcase | Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone &amp; more" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brzOBsdEAf8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By tuning into the showcase, those who are already active COD players will be given rewards for their dedication to the live stream, with the rewards scaling as you dedicate more time to watching the live stream. At CODNext, Treyarch and Raven have teamed up with content creators who cover the franchise and has given them access to the game to experience and showcase the Black Ops 6 Multiplayer and give commentary while they play through it.</p>
<p>If you're watching along at home, you can get the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-event-code-bowl-v-black-ops-6-beta-intel#NEXT-Rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following rewards</a> for tuning in. Here are the rewards you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 minutes: "Mine" emblem</li>
<li>60 minutes: "Earning Stripes" Calling Card</li>
<li>90 minutes: "Tri Harder" Charm</li>
<li>120 minutes: "The Redactor" Weapon Blueprint</li>
</ul>
<p>Excited fans will also get to hear the developers talk about their journey creating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and some of the most crucial features being added to the upcoming game, such as Omnimovement. They will also discuss the multiplayer maps that have been added to the game and the choices behind the ones they added, with a deep dive into the map design. Taking feedback from players across previous Call of Duty games, the developers sat down and spoke about how they wanted to add in those gunfight scenarios from the Cold War and wanted players to experience plenty of "controlled chaos."</p>
<p>For those who prefer to avoid traditional multiplayer, there are also many discussions about the Zombies aspect of Black Ops 6, a well-loved feature that has appeared in many previous Call of Duty games, and how they looked at prior iterations of the game mode and what made it so special, while also looking to the future to see how they can provide a modern twist on the game mode.</p>
<p>So far, from what is currently being showcased at the CODNEXT Showcase, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is shaping up to be a very smooth experience, with fast-paced combat with new weaponry and even more flair in executions with the usage of omnimovement. By adding omnimovement back into the game, it allows for an even quicker battle, as you can run, jump and slide anywhere you like to gain an advantage over your opponent.</p>
