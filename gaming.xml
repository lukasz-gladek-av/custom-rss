            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Is it me, or is The Game Awards really good this year? It’s made all the better because one of the key announcements was the upcoming arrival of a brand new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. Seriously, if you lived on the Sega side of the street, you never needed to bother with Tekken, because Virtua Fighter was – to my mind anyway – vastly superior. The fact that it’s going to go up against the fantastic Tekken 8 means that 3D-fighting fans are really eating well right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEW VIRTUA FIGHTER Project | World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmeGL2JP9N0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer was a particularly teasy trailer, as it only gave us a few details. First amongst them was that it’s the Ryu Ga Gotoku studio that’s working on this new entry in the Virtua Fighter series. You might know them as the team behind the huge Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, and given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which in turn fed from Virtua Fighter, makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going at it in a sandy cityscape, with Akira sporting a new undercover look – that’s a fedora and trenchcoat if you were wondering – before then shifting perspective to point us towards an upcoming VF Direct where we’ll learn (hopefully) all the most important details.</p>
<p>Fans of the series – myself included – have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now, so I’m hoping that with the new title coming a few more people will hop in so I can practice poking them with Lion’s silly pointy fingers.</p>

<p>The VF Direct will take place on December 13th at 12am ET. Stay tuned for more as we have it</p>

		<p>The first of two big and bold game reveals, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Project Century, which seems to be a Like a Dragon game that takes us back to 1915 Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Century Reveal Trailer The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JanPitSWd94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Century is set in a particularly interesting point in time, both as newer technologies like record players filter into society, but also as more and more morsels of Western culture could filter through to Japan.</p>
<p>Of course, you know what was around back then? Gangs. Fisticuffs. Smoking. Looking cool.</p>

			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Saber Interactive announced Turok: Origins, an upcoming co-op game based on the classic IP. In this title, players will become Turok warriors to face off against ferocious dinosaurs and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all humanity. However, they'll be powerful enough to take them on with devastating attacks powered by weapons and abilities. They may also harness fallen enemies' DNA to upgrade their arsenal.</p>
<p>In Turok: Origins, players will join the fight either alone or as a team against a variety of dinosaurs, creatures, and bosses that take to the ground, sky, swamps, and caves to push their skills to the limit. Engage in intense combat, where players must use everything at their disposal to ensure success, including melee attacks, special abilities, and fine-tuned weapons. Throughout the game, they'll unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry to dominate battles and neutralize foes. Plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more are all at disposal.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it will be possible to extract DNA from fallen enemies and the environment to unlock game-changing powers that evolve the Turoks' suit in real-time. Each DNA power not only enhances the character's look but also offers upgradable skills and abilities to give the players an edge in combat.</p>
<p>In the game's missions, players journey across deadly worlds on various planets. From ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles, each location is said to hold pieces of an unforgettable story packed with twists and turns.</p>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay has been shown at The Game Awards, where a brand-new trailer was revealed and showcased some of the exploration and combat that you'll be able to take part in when the game releases.

<p>The Outer Worlds was a huge success and was first released in 2020. Since then, the game has seen the release of multiple DLCs, as well as an upgrade to the game, which provides cosmetics and extra content for those who want more of the action.</p>
<p>If you're interested in The Outer Worlds 2, the game is currently available on the wishlist, with the game set to release on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|X, and PC. Make sure to check out the trailer of The Outer Worlds 2 below for more of the chaos and energy that you saw in the first game.

<p>For those who want to see more about The Outer Worlds 2, this game will also be featured in the upcoming Secret Level anthology series that is streaming on Prime Video. The episode related to The Outer Worlds will air on December 17, showcasing both The Outer Worlds and the upcoming title.</p>
<p>While The Outer Worlds 2 is an Xbox and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC exclusive</a>, it's possible that it will come to PlayStation in the future, as the first Outer Worlds is now available on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't much news about this title other than the official trailer above, which has a lot of great wit, shows off the aesthetic well, and builds on some great tropes to make fun of and make the trailer a lighthearted moment.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest events in gaming is taking place tonight, where many developers, gamers, actors, and more gather to watch the nominated games win their deserved awards and see major announcements about upcoming games. One of the games that people have been eagerly awaiting and will get to see tonight is <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/">Borderlands 4</a>, where people will finally get a proper glimpse into the upcoming title. Up until this point, there has been a very minimal amount of detail given to Borderlands fans, other than the initial announcement that the game is indeed happening. The game doesn't have a release date yet, and the teaser for the game was only a couple of seconds long. Tonight, those interested in the beloved franchise will get to see a trailer never-before-seen, set to preview at<a href="https://thegameawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The Game Awards</a>, which you will be able to see below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - First Look Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8CaRnf0zO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This trailer is precisely what the Borderlands fans needed, as it fills in a little bit more of the details, as the eagerly awaiting fans only had access to a couple of pictures of concept art of the environments, which was showcased at PAX West, where the developers set down to talk about the game in the Gearbox Main Theater. The conversation was filmed and<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2238145538" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> uploaded on Twitch</a>, which is still available for you to watch now.</p>
<p>At the moment, the release date still isn't known, but the game is set to be released in 2025. The trailer was announced by the Founder of Gearbox Software, Randy Pitchford. The game is available to be wishlisted on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This game includes new Vault Hunters for you to play as, with many different weapons to choose from and utilize as you get to explore a brand-new planet that a terrifying leader is ruling. Compared to the other games in the franchise, Borderlands 4 is set to have the most expansive and diverse Vault Hunter skill tree out of all of the released games and gives players the most options for customization with their builds.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 will include new traversal mechanics, which will allow you to get types of loot in every nook and cranny, with the option to summon a vehicle on almost any part of the terrain to be able to travel the planet named Kairos.</p>
<p>Like previous games, Borderlands 4 will allow you to fight solo or in co-op, depending on what your preference is. If you choose to go with co-op, you'll be able to play with up to three other people.</p>

<p>“Borderlands 4 is a mayhem-fueled looter shooter, jam-packed with billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action,” says the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam page</a>. “Break free from a dangerous hidden planet as one of four new badass Vault Hunters.” Oh! Nobody told me they were badasses. That changes everything.</p>
<p>You’ll be vault hunting solo or with up to three other players in co-op, and there'll also be skill trees and dynamic movement abilities, touts Steam. You’ll be collecting many, many guns with “death-dealing firepower”, which feels like a superfluous description. I suppose maybe you’d need to say that if there was also non-lethal firepower. There are a lot of guns. I’ll withhold judgement. There’ll also be “free-form combat and exploration, pulse-pounding boss fights, infinitely varied loot drops, and an eclectic cast of unforgettable characters new and old.”</p><p>Great. Great. It’s great. I’m sure it’s great. Steam lists the game as “coming soon”, although the trailer reckons 2025. Who to trust in these uncertain times? Ah well, a little uncertainty makes it exciting. I mean, comparatively speaking anyway.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> creators Hinterlands have announced The Long Dark 2, another helping of open-ended wilderness survival. Actually titled Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 - a travestying of naming conventions that is surely more harrowing than any post-apocalyptic winter - it's out in early access in 2026, and introduces urban environments together with a "Will to Live" sanity system and co-op multiplayer. Here's the trailer.

<p>
And here's some backstory, care of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586260/BLACKFROST_The_Long_Dark_2/">the just-launched Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Experience the Quiet Apocalypse as survivors in the northern industrial city of Harmont and its vast environs. A year has passed since the Aurora first appeared in the sky, rendering all technology inert, with survivors just starting to emerge to face their new reality in its aftermath. Surrounded by a majestic, rugged wilderness, encounter the remnants of an isolated society still coming to terms with how the world has just been forever changed. How will you choose to survive?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In case the mention of co-op has you screaming, fashioning yourself a wolfskin pelt, and fleeing to the hillside caves, it looks like single-player is still the heart of the game. But you'll potentially have a lot more company, as players must decide whether to join communities of NPC survivors. Co-op players, meanwhile, will "lean on each other and combine your skills and efforts to eke out another day of existence in the hostile environment". I'm not sure whether this means there are unique co-op mechanics. If my co-op partner dies, can I eat them and knit their entrails into a scarf? 
</p><p>
And then there are the new urban areas. "Cities and towns offer new opportunities, and new hazards to your survival, introducing a fresh take on the established survival formula," the Steam page explains. "The wilds are dangerous, but sometimes the city is where the real threats lie." I assume they're not talking about boy racers at the traffic lights.
</p>
<p>
The new Will to Live system complicates the already-steep challenge of keeping yourself fed, watered and uninjured. It "adds elements of psychological survival to the mix, introducing Resilience and its sub-stats to the well-established mechanics," according to the Steam page. "Manage your doubts and fears, and find comfort in the small things if you want to survive."
</p>
<p>
You might be wondering what this "blackfrost" stuff is. It's one of the new hazards, a radioactive substance emitted by a distant reactor complex. It's not clear how exactly it affects you, but you'll want to avoid it. Ditto the "Aurora Storms" and "extreme weather events".
</p>
<p>
There's also a new  Permalife system which sounds like a narrativised respawn feature, in that it  "turns every death into a new adventure". The Steam page phrases it thusly: "Accumulate new risks and fears for your survivor as you move through the world and succumb to various hazards. Face your fears, overcome their downsides, and strengthen your Survivor's story in the world. Make your mark." If you don't like the sound of this, the old Permadeath mode is still an option.
</p><p>
I never played much of The Long Dark. It was for me The Short Dark, in that I struggled to make it past the first hut. Perhaps I'll fare better with the help of a friendly player in the sequel? Or perhaps, I'll just end up padding their stomach?

<p>The announcement took the gaming community by surprise, after all, it was believed that the franchise would never return. However, relatively recent indications pointed to the contrary.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Capcom was the victim of a hacker attack that ended up leaking several of its projects. Among them, a new Onimusha had been mentioned. In addition, the publisher licensed the franchise for Netflix to make an anime.</p>



<p>Few details about the game have been released so far. All we know is that it is being made on the RE Engine and will be released on consoles and PC in 2026.</p>

<p>Arrowhead has announced — and released — a brand new major update for Helldivers 2 known as Omens of Tyranny.</p>



<p>“The time has come, Helldivers. The War has changed,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">description reads</a>. “These are dark times for freedom-loving citizens everywhere. Our galaxy grows cold from the embrace of old enemies returning and darkens with the threat of new horrors emerging.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In Omens of Tyranny, a new faction called The Illuminate “returns” to challenge the Helldivers.</p>



<p>“They are advanced, highly intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic,” Arrowhead said. “The Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.”</p>



<p>In addition to the new faction, new areas to fight are being added to the game along with a new vehicle known as the Fast Recon Vehicle (FRV). The entire squad can travel in the FRV together, making sure no one is left behind as they spread democracy.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku has published a first look at Project Century, a new and developing title. It’s an action-packed game set in Japan in 1915, and the trailer showcases intense, visceral combat and a stunning world. It’s an early introduction to what is only one of the studio’s upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>Not much is known about Project Century, but the first glimpse we’ve had of the developing title looks stellar:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Most recently, Ryu Ga Gotoku was responsible for the delivery of the Like a Dragon series and standalone games like Lost Judgment. It looks like Project Century follows very much in that vein.</p>

A release window for the PlayStation 5 version was not announced. <span id="more-932287"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Seasun Games:</p><blockquote><p><em>Mecha BREAK</em> will be released on PC and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [25,204 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> with three ways to play: six-versus-six Battlefield, three-versus-three Arena, and the tactical <a title="Genres > Co-Op [220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> player-versus-player-versus-environment mode, with more exciting updates to come.</p><p><em>Mecha BREAK</em>‘s unique mech-centric gameplay will feature these three distinct game modes at launch along with additional out-of-combat explorable areas and gameplay mechanics coming in the future. The new player-versus-player-versus-environment game mode will be showcased in upcoming beta tests, taking place on a massive map with rewards earned by defeating NPCs and capturing strongholds. Additionally, players are able to team up with other squads to challenge giant boss mechs for even higher-tier rewards, introducing tactical competition between different squad groups.</p><p>The latest additions to player-versus-player-versus-environment include swappable weapon pickups and weaponized gliders, enabling players to dynamically enhance their mech’s capabilities in close-quarters combat, healing, sniping, suppressive fire, and more to give them a tactical edge. Strategic planning is key in <em>Mecha BREAK</em>, so effective communication with teammates will be essential to lead them to victory. Prepare for adrenaline-pumping battles, lightning-fast maneuvers, and explosive firepower.</p><p>In post-release updates, <em>Mecha BREAK</em> will receive a walkable space station complete with a hangar, a tactical command center, private living quarters, a shooting range, and more explorable spaces. <a title="Companies > Seasun Games [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/seasun-games">Amazing Seasun Games</a> have previously shared some early looks at the walkable station areas and teased plans for an ambitious new game mode that allows players to exit their mech’s cockpit to engage enemies. This is part of a long-term development plan for <em>Mecha BREAK</em>, a hybrid of the best aspects of mech combat with infantry combat.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The story of <em>Mecha BREAK</em> sees players battling for control over a mysterious mineral known as Eruptive Inorganic Carbide (EIC) or “Corite.” This substance emerged from geological disasters during the Revival Era of the game’s timeline. Corite manifests from the ground in the form of towering mineral columns and hazardous mines formed by volcanic activity. Its immense technological value, with applications in the energy and tech industries, makes it a vital resource for post-Catastrophe reconstruction. Corite is also linked to severe health problems, but its technical application in the world of <em>Mecha BREAK</em> is so great that multiple factions are willing to fight (and die) over it despite its health risks.</p><p>A story trailer released last week explains the events that led to the current conflict that <em>Mecha BREAK</em> players will be participating in. A coronal mass ejection from the Sun kicked off geological disasters around the globe on a scale unmatched throughout human history. Humanity still clings to this transformed world, splintering into multiple different factions who are now battling over a mysterious new resource known as “Corite.” This battle for resource control has driven society into a new age, with each faction holding its own ulterior motives.</p><p>The team at Amazing Seasun Games is excited to welcome players into the world of <em>Mecha BREAK</em> in 2025. <em>Mecha BREAK</em> is a love letter to the mech fantasy and all of the games within it, which continue to inspire the <em>Mecha BREAK</em> team to produce the highest-quality game possible for the dedicated fans of the genre.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span></span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Mecha BREAK - Game Mode Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/alXPwfMoNjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Mecha BREAK - ゲームモードトレーラー | The Game Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0yEvVa1ZcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Traditional Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="機甲對決 - 遊戲模式預告片｜The Game Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsymoqee7Co?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At The Game Awards, Sega debuted the first teaser for Virtua Fighter 6. The publisher also revealed that more info will follow at a Virtua Fighter Direct after the conclusion of The Game Awards.</p><p>Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios will be tackling the franchise as it starts a new era on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The original Virtua Fighter debuted in arcades in 1993, where it innovated 3D fighting games. It paved the way for other fighting games like Tekken to follow in a similar style.</p><p>The previous game in the franchise, Virtua Fighter 5, was originally released in 2006, and it's been remastered a few times, most recently as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-is-the-franchises-second-wind/1100-6492167/" data-ref-id="1100-6492167">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> in 2021.

The patch adds the mind-controlling Illuminate civilization to the game, a faction that uses psychic powers to overtake Super Earth citizens and transform them into mindless thralls.</p><p>As seen in the trailer that was released during The Game Awards, the update also adds a Jeep-like vehicle to the game and new urban, city-like environments as well. Only time will tell how these new additions affect the flow of the ongoing conflict to defend Super Earth, as this update means the Game Masters that affect the enemy strategies in the background of Helldivers 2 now have more toys to play with as they attempt to outsmart players' efforts.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk0XkX0U_m0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zk0XkX0U_m0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>This story is developing...</em></p>

              <section>

                <p>Like A Dragon studio Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) is developing an open-world crime game set in the year 1915. Its working title is Project Century and the announcement trailer debuted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards</a>.</p><p>Project Century seems to be set in the middle of a rapidly industrializing Japan, but the exact location is unclear. The first few moments of the trailer show traditional wooden buildings surrounded by electrical wires and smokestacks. As a jazz band plays, citizens of the city mull around market stalls, ride street trams, and get into street brawls.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hihuPFku9I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-hihuPFku9I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then the trailer switches into showing off what appears to be gameplay. The camera follows one figure from behind as he beats, bruises, and brutalizes foes. The style is distinctly more vicious than Like A Dragon: enemies spurt out blood and the protagonist dual wields crowbars and knives. One sequence appears to be a boss battle against a massive, sledgehammer-wielding villain. It's not all violence. In one scene, he leads a well-dressed woman down an alley and, in the trailer's final moments, watches a tram go by.</p><p>Further details are under wraps for now, as the trailer did not show a release window or even list platforms Project Century would be available on. The trailer states that the footage shown is "pre-alpha."</p>

Season pass owners will be able to access Clive 72 hours early.</p><p>The reveal trailer shows Clive fighting against Jin. They both have similar motifs as they can summon a single wing from their backs, which is a thematic fit for the trailer. Clive proceeds to knock Jin around using his flame-based powers that he received from Ifrit. At the end, he summons Ifrit himself to finish Jin off.</p><p>In Final Fantasy XVI, Clive has powers from multiple elements such as ice, water, lighting, and earth.

            <p>
Nearly a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-long-dark-dev-teases-unannounced-survival-game-that-might-just-be-the-long-dark-2">teasing</a> an 'unannounced survival game' that looked suspiciously like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> 2, developer Hinterland's has officially unveiled its snowy survival sequel. It's called Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 and it's coming to Steam early access in 2026.
</p>
<p>
While our first tease of The Long Dark 2 in January didn't go much beyond a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room, Hinterland's The Game Awards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIAiNhlghY4">announcement trailer</a> shows considerably more, with the wilderness action of its predecessor now expanded to cover towns and even cities gripped by the apocalyptic winter.
</p>
<p>
"A year has passed since the Aurora first appeared in the sky, rendering all technology inert, with survivors just starting to emerge to face their new reality in its aftermath," Hinterland explains on Steam. "Surrounded by a majestic, rugged wilderness, encounter the remnants of an isolated society still coming to terms with how the world has just been forever changed. How will you choose to survive?"

</p><p>
Blackfrost can be played solo, with lone adventurers able to rely on NPC communities as they explore the world. Alternatively, co-op is supported, enabling friends to help each other, combining their efforts and skills to stay alive in the face of dangerous wildlife, harsh weather events, aurora storms, and even the titular radioactive Blackfrost.
</p><p>
"Build your own survivor," continues Hinterland, "customise traits and skills, collect scars and stories, and experience a life as a survivor in this beautiful yet dangerous world." There's even a new Permalife mode to complement the original's returning Permadeath, where players can turn "every death into a new adventure" by facing their fears, overcoming their downsides, and strengthening their survivors story - whatever that means.
</p>
<p>
The Long Dark 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586260/BLACKFROST_The_Long_Dark_2/">enters Steam early access</a> in 2026, when it will "launch without the game's complete planned world or feature set" and will be "built a piece at a time". Hinterland can says this'll help it "work towards strength in community-informed iteration and development". But given the studio is still to deliver the final episode of the original Long Dark's story mode - originally supposed to be the focus of the game when it was Kickstarted over 11 years - series fans might not be so accommodating with Hinterland's approach a second time around.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> protagonist Clive Rosfield is coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> as the first guest character.
</p>
<p>
As revealed at tonight's The Game Awards, Clive will be joining the game on 20th December for general access (with 72-hour early access for Year 1 Pass holders) bringing plenty of fiery Ifrit moves and swordplay to the fist fight.
</p>
<p>
His addition rounds out the first season DLC, meaning sadly it looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s Tifa won't be joining despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-harada-acknowledges-fan-desire-to-include-final-fantasys-tifa">Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada acknowleding fan interest</a>.
</p>
<p>

It seems the character will have lines from Ben Starr and a new arena based on the game will be added: a flaming pit with battling Ifrit in the background.

"The only fantasy here is yours," says Clive, in a nod to the famous line from the game.
</p>
<p>
Earlier in the evening, Tekken 8 won the award for best fighting game.

		<p>Wargaming has revealed Steel Hunters, their next big online multiplayer game, but instead of WW2 and Cold War tanks, boats and planes, this has got great bit forking mechs!</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game with undercurrents of hero shooters, battle royale and extraction shooter… but you’re in great big mechs that are definitely very reminiscent of Transformers and (for the cultured among us) Zoids.</p>
<p>With a full release expected next year, Wargaming are kicking off a reveal day playtest, which is available tonight from 12th until 22nd December. Join now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://steelhunters.com/">Steel Hunters website</a>.</p>

		<p>The Game Awards played host to the next game from genDesign, the studio of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ico">ICO</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-guardian">The Last Guardian</a> creator Fumito Ueda.</p>
<p><iframe title="genDESIGN Teaser for Latest Title | The Game Awards 2024 (English subtitles)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJHXe_9uhxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A game that is as yet unnamed, it seems to feature a lot of the tone and feel of Ueda’s work, though viewed through a sci-fi lens of sorts.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an ominous message to evacuate the region surrounding ground zero, and then a countdown before a cataclysmic event, there’s a rushed climb up a huge body, which leads to a giant mech head that, thankfully, manages to blast off and detach from its body before a brutal storm blows in.</p>
<p>That’s all we’ve got to go on right now, but it’s great to see that the minds behind some landmark games from the PS2 and PS3 are back to work on something equally distinctive.</p>
