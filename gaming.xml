<p>Pop Up, Superstar!</p>

<figure data-uuid="0ab8c7f0d20ff"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ab8c7f0d20ff/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>This week, London will be treated to its very first pop-up Nintendo Store, making all of us UK Mario fans clutch our wallets in fear.</p>
<p>The shop opens to the public tomorrow (<strong>22nd October</strong>) in the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, where it will be stocking its sweet merch until <strong>16th November</strong>. Those hoping to visit before 26th Oct will need to <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">book a ticket</a> to attend, but you'll be able to rock up as usual after this date — just expect some good old-fashioned queuing!</p>
<p>Before the doors <em>officially</em> open, we have been lucky enough to get a sneak peek at the store and see some of the wonderful goodies within. Keen to give all those hoping to attend in the coming weeks a heads up on what you can expect, we've assembled the following merch gallery, so you can start to prep those wishlists.</p>
<p>You might recognise some of the following pieces if you've spent much time browsing the Japanese Nintendo stock online, but this gives us a good chance to get our hands on it <em>without</em> booking a flight to Tokyo...</p>
<p>Let's start with some clothing, perfect for DK enthusiasts and Nintendo all-rounders alike:</p>

<p>There's home decor featuring the likes of Pikmin and Splatoon:</p>

<p>It couldn't be a Nintendo Store without plushies galore:</p>

<p>Some particularly neat figures of the statues found in the flagship Nintendo Stores in the US and Japan:</p>
<figure data-uuid="6d5774430139e"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d5774430139e/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plenty of Switch 2 merch and amiibo — you know, for those who <em>haven't</em> seen one yet...</p>

<p>And finally, the checkout, where bank balances weep into their exclusive pop-up store London tote bags</p>
<figure data-uuid="1f3737adccea0"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f3737adccea0/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We should note that there's no guarantee all of this merchandise will be on the shelves if you visit the pop-up later in its run — if there's one thing we've learnt about exclusive merch, it's that it sells out <em>fast</em>. That said, the store will be sticking around for a good while, so there's still plenty of time to visit if you find yourself in the big city.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-demo-bloober-team/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-in-time-for-halloween-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-a-free-demo-on-pc.1330717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's latest release, Cronos: The New Dawn, now has a demo available for players on PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, to coincide with the game also being on sale on both storefronts just in time for the Halloween season.</p>



<p>The new demo is 30 minutes long, and it's not for nothing, since if you decide to pick up the game after playing the demo, your progress from the demo carries over into the full version of the game, so you can continue playing without skipping a beat.</p>



<p>Console players are left out of the fun, unfortunately for them, but if you have a capable PC, you'll be able to try out Bloober Team's latest release after its stunning Silent Hill 2 Remake. You can also check out a trailer for the demo below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | PC Demo Available Now | STEAM &amp; EPIC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muJlwDnk9Dk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The demo covers the game's first mission, giving you an overview and introduction to the combat, how the creatures you'll face merge into bigger, more terrifying monsters, and give you a taste for two of the game's weapons. Also, even though console players are left out of getting a free demo, they're included with regard to Cronos: The New Dawn being on sale, since it is 15% off on Steam, the Epic Games Store, the PlayStation Store (beginning on Oct.22), the Microsoft Store, the Nintendo eShop, and GOG.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed</a> Cronos: The New Dawn last month, he gave it an 8/10 and praised its setting, story, and level design paired with the new merge mechanic. "<em>With its by-the-books survival horror experience, its first few hours feeling more frustrating than fun due to clunky combat and average enemy design, Cronos: The Dawn seemed to be nothing more than an unremarkable survival horror heavily inspired by the Dead Space series. Push past the around two hours mark, however, and the game blossoms into one of Bloober Team's best titles to date, thanks to its quirky mechanics, solid level design, unique setting and mystery-filled story.</em>"</p>



<p>If you're looking for other Halloween-appropriate games to play as we near the end of the month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-2025/">the Epic Games Store's current Halloween sale has several horror games on sale,</a> including Bloober Team's other major release in recent years, Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-dev-kit-price-chinese-tariffs-microsoft-2000637701</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-xbox-dev-kits-to-2-000.1330714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Current-gen Xbox dev kits used to cost $1,500. They’ll now be $2,000 for any game studio who wants to make a game for Xbox Series X/S and doesn’t already have one.</p> <p>That’s according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a></em> which says developers received the updated pricing in a recent email from Microsoft. “The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,” the email to game development partners apparently reads. “We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.”</p> <p>Microsoft has been blaming “macroeconomic” conditions for all of its recent price hikes without explicitly blaming President Trump’s 30-percent tariffs on Chinese imports as part of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">administration’s ongoing trade war</a>. The 33-percent price hike on dev kits comes after similar increases to the price of the Xbox consoles players can buy online and in stores, as well as a 50-percent spike in Game Pass Ultimate membership fees this month.</p>

 <p>While the tariffs explain the new barriers to making games for Xbox, the price increase <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ally-x-price-next-gen-hardware-console-2000637280">won’t help perceptions</a> that Microsoft is deprioritizing its hardware amid a new multiplatform publishing push and reported mandates from the tech giant’s c-suite to boost profit wherever possible. Game Pass has been a boon to some of the indie developers who get deals with it, but there are also plenty of smaller third-party games that now seem to skip Xbox at launch.</p> <p>Even Moon Studios, maker of the hit Xbox platformer <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, recently suggested the console port of its top-down Soulslike <em>No Rest for the</em> <em>Wicked</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659">would skip Xbox</a> at launch because the investment wasn’t worth the payoff right now. Nevertheless, Microsoft says its still developing next-gen hardware, and did just launch the new Asus-made Xbox Ally PC gaming handhelds. A developer could get two $1,000 Xbox Ally Xs for the price of a new dev kit.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-forerunner-55-now-cheaper-than-a-regular-watch-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low-2000637674</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-forerunner-55-now-cheaper-than-a-regular-watch-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low.1330711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to be training for the New York Marathon to benefit from a GPS running watch that understands your fitness level. Most people just want to run a few miles without guessing their pace, track progress over time and maybe figure out why some runs feel easier than others. The Garmin Forerunner 55 handles all of that without the overwhelming feature bloat of flagship models, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $199 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The core appeal lies in how this watch removes the mental load from running: You lace up, press start and the GPS tracks your route while the optical heart rate sensor monitors your effort level. After the run, you get clear feedback on distance covered, average pace per mile, heart rate zones throughout the workout, and total elevation gain if you tackled any hills. This data accumulates over weeks and months and reveals patterns that help you understand what’s actually improving versus what just feels different on any given day.</p>
<h2>Two Weeks Battery Life</h2>
<p>Smartwatch battery life usually means charging every night or every other day, and turn your fitness tracker into another device competing for outlet space. The <strong>Forerunner 55 runs for two full weeks in normal smartwatch mode</strong>, displaying time, notifications and daily stats without needing a charge. Switch to GPS mode for tracking runs and you get 20 hours of continuous recording which is enough for multiple marathons back-to-back if you were so inclined.</p>
<p><em>PacePro</em> is worthy of coverage because it answers a common race-morning headache for runners. It can be set with a desired finish time for a certain distance, after which it works out precisely what your pace through every part of a course must be. If it’s a hilly course, it even makes automatic adjustments for you, urging you to ease off on ascents and accelerate on downhills in order to reach your total time target.</p>



<p>Each day’s recommendations come on to the watch screen in the morning from Garmin’s algorithms based on your last few sessions of training, your current level of fitness, and your recovery condition. It’s not boilerplate “run 3 miles today” recommendations. The system may suggest interval sessions if you’ve been running continuously through the week, for example, or recommend a gentle recovery jog if yesterday’s tempo run was especially strenuous. Each recommendation includes bespoke aims for duration, pace, and heart rate ranges, which is basically like your own coach that is tailored to how your body is reacting to training.</p>



<p>The activity library goes well beyond running: <strong>There is cycling, track running, virtual treadmill run, pool swim, Pilates, HIIT, breathwork</strong> with specific tracking modes that retain suitable metrics for that specific type of activity. <strong>Pool swim mode automatically tracks</strong> strokes and number of laps while HIIT tracks work as well as intervals of rest. The watch can therefore be worn through the whole calendar year even as running becomes secondary through seasons or when cross-training is dictated due to injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness features run continuously in the background and tracks stress levels through heart rate variability, monitoring respiration rate throughout the day, and calculates your fitness age based on activity patterns and VO2 max estimates. The Body Battery metric deserves special mention because it quantifies energy levels on a 0-100 scale, helping you understand when you’re actually recovered enough for hard training versus when you should take it easy.</p>
<p>The <em>Connect IQ Store</em> opens up customization so that you can switch up the watch face, add data fields that expose exactly the measurements you are concerned with when running, and third-party apps that increase functionality. You can add a weather app, load training plans from specific coaches, or load in data pages that are optimized for triathlon training in case your interests are elsewhere than running.</p>
<p>At $169, that’s cheaper than most fashion smartwatches with a fraction of the fitness tracking ability.</p>

                <p>Fortnite is reportedly set to get a major update in November that adds a big crossover with the iconic animated franchise The Simpsons. Now, the latest leaks have suggested that it won't just be The Simpson family coming to Fortnite, but also some of Springfield's residents, including Ned Flanders.</p><p>Flanders is among the best-known characters on The Simpsons, so his inclusion in the update would be little surprise. We don't know if this is true just yet, so take the leak with a grain of salt for now. Will there be a skin that celebrates <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Stupid_Sexy_Flanders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"stupid sexy Flanders"</a>? We'll have to wait and see.</p><p>The rumored upcoming Fortnite collaboration with The Simpsons is said to be significant, with Fortnite adding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">new map based on Springfield</a> and featuring its various points of interest, like the nuclear power plant where Homer works.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">everything we've heard so far about the rumored Simpsons collaboration with Fortnite.</a> The new season is rumored to begin in early November.</p><p>In semi-related news, a fan-made re-skin of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run focusing on Futurama has <a href="https://x.com/UltimateSema/status/1980611084353696072" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drawn the praise of one of the game's original designers</a>.</p><p>As for the TV series, The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and is now in its 37th season. The show was renewed earlier this year and will continue through at least Season 40 in 2028-2029. A second Simpsons Movie is coming as well, and it's set for release in July 2027, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-announced-coming-july-2027/1100-6535348/" data-ref-id="1100-6535348">on the same day as A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>

			<p>As of the publication of this article, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is finally out on all platforms. It took 21 years and a near-cancellation to get this sequel, which is really more of a spiritual successor, but those who have been yearning for a new action roleplaying game in the world of Vampire: The Masquerade now have a new game to play. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review</a>, I wrote that the game, albeit flawed, is worth a look if you are into the setting and genre, although you're probably better off waiting for a discount. The other big reason to delay getting your hands on this game is that maybe, just maybe, the developers will be able to improve the optimization, which is currently dreadful on PC.</p>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5. However, it is pretty basic in its feature set. There are no ray traced settings to enable, and the game as a whole is far from the best showcase of Epic's game-making technology. Even the texture work is not always great, and the open world of Seattle is quite small by current standards. Long story short, it's not doing anything special.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 4K PC Gameplay - Open World and Side Content" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIGBaYKn66w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, by now, we are used to reporting about Unreal Engine games having troubles with stuttering, but this is on another level entirely. As you can see in the gameplay video, the game stutters constantly while in the open world, whereas most titles that suffer from this issue only have that problem when loading another big chunk of the playable area. When you go inside interiors, the stuttering is slightly less prominent (but not at all gone).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I used NVIDIA FrameView and FLAT to better analyze the very same open world gameplay segment seen in the footage. The results are frankly astounding, and not in a good way. As you can see from the frame time graph, we have an inexplicable peak of 175 milliseconds, but even taking that aside, many times during the custom benchmark the frame time spiked beyond 40ms, meaning the frame rate dropped to 25 frames per second. It may have been for just a moment, but that's what makes it jarring.</p>



<p>The average frame rate is not at all a problem. With a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, settings set to Ultra, NVIDIA DLAA enabled and NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, the game averages 220 frames per second. The issue is that it constantly drops very low, then picks back up again, and so on and so forth, providing the opposite of a smooth experience.</p>



<p>By the way, this isn't like the case of Dying Light: The Beast, where Techland later <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-hotfix-patch-addresses-frame-generation-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to fix an issue with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation that caused undue stuttering</a>. I actually played most of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with Frame Generation turned off, simply because it couldn't really help at all with this game's stuttering, and the issue was still there.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to FLAT, the game was stuttering 20,29% of the entire time of the benchmark, which is by far the worst result I have ever seen. Usually, even the worst cases of stuttering reach around 9 or 10%. The analysis thus confirms the subjective experience: this is perhaps the worst example of stuttering seen in a long time in a PC game, and we've seen a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>As if that wasn't enough, like I mentioned in the full review, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 also completely lacks support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. This is just outright unacceptable for a game of this caliber that launches in late 2025. The first triple-A games started implementing HDR eight years ago, and nowadays most displays support HDR. Besides, based on what developers tell me, it should be really easy to implement it via Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don't have much good news to share with regard to the technical side of this game. Like I said, we can only hope that some optimization fixes will be introduced with a patch, but I had already warned the development team after the preview build and there were pretty much no improvements from that build to the launch one. Maybe now they will take a closer look.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-discovery-is-officially-up-for-sale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-is-up-for-sale-currently-reviewing-interest-%E2%80%9Cfrom-multiple-parties%E2%80%9D.1330681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html">announced that it is officially up for sale</a> and that it is reviewing interest and inquiries "<em>from multiple parties</em>." The announcement comes as Warner Bros is in the middle of splitting from Discovery Global, though that split isn't stopping Warner Bros. Discovery from taking a look at any offers it gets for someone who wants to come in and pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>WBD says the decision to publicly announce it is up on the shelf comes from the "<em>unsolicited interest the Company has received</em>," and that its board will remain open to all options, including "<em>continuing to advance the Company's planned separation to completion by mid-2026, a transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, WBD is saying that if there's any company that wants the whole kit-and-kaboodle, that's an option. If a company wants to just buy separate parts of the company, like, for example, a company purchasing just the Warner Bros. Games division, that's an option. Or, of course, the WBD board could just not take any of these purchase offers and continue on its current course to separate from Discovery Global by mid-2026.</p>



<p>WBD is also considering "<em>an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally</em>," president and chief executive officer of WBD, David Zaslav, added in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</em> <em>It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets</em>."</p>



<p>This is not the first time the idea of Warner Bros. Discovery, as an entire company, or its separate businesses, has been on the shelf. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-sale-full-abandoned/">heard several rumours</a> in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-considering-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-and-studios-acquisition/">including around acquisition interest from companies like Sony</a>, that some sort of sale would be possible, though nothing has materialized as of yet.</p>



<p>Specifically regarding the games division of Warner Bros., it's not unfair to say that David Zaslav and his leadership have absolutely mucked it up in recent years. Despite WBD's struggles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/">Hogwarts Legacy was a stunning commercial success</a>, and yet, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-might-be-making-dc-comics-live-service-game/">obsession with live service games</a> that plagues the triple-A videogame industry seems to have struck Zaslav and company more than most, with declarations that even having <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/">the best-selling game in a calendar year in your portfolio "<em>isn't enough</em>."</a></p>



<p>While making triple-A games has become more expensive, it would certainly be easier if the company financing those triple-A games also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-11/warner-bros-discovery-chief-david-zaslavs-pay-hits-52-million-as-board-changes-loom">didn't have to pay insane salaries to its top executives</a>. Not over paying <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/">for people who clearly aren't doing the best job</a> would also probably help retain the veteran, top-level talent that WBD used to have on its employment sheet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">instead of invoking mass layoffs and shuttering studios that have been around for decades</a>.</p>



<p>The whole statement from WBD today puports, like many of its statements, that this has all been done with shareholders in mind and that reviewing potential sales from interested parties "<em>is in the best interest of shareholders</em>." It's worth noting that what's also likely in the best interest of shareholders of WBD is giving Zaslav the boot, and installing a president who won't run the company so badly that it needs to go <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">through major restructuring</a> and/or beg for a saviour to swoop in and buy it while the franchises it holds licensing rights to still have value.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After raising prices on Xbox consoles and subscriptions, Microsoft is now turning its attention to Xbox developers. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the company is significantly increasing the price of its Xbox Development Kit (XDK) — the custom hardware used by developers to build Xbox games.</p><p>The current Xbox dev kit is moving from $1,500 to $2,000, a 33 percent jump in price. “The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,” says Microsoft in an announcement to Xbox developers, seen by <em>The Verge</em>. “We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.” I asked Microsoft to comment on the price rise, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>The price increases to the Xbox dev kit come just a month after Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hiked the price of its Xbox Series X</a> console for the second time this year. The second price increase to the Series X means the console is now $150 more than it was just six months ago.</p><p>Microsoft also blamed “changes in the macroeconomic environment” for its latest Xbox console price hike last month, and both the increases to consoles and dev kits, 30 percent and 33 percent respectively, align with the Trump administration’s 30 percent tariff on imports from China. A recent report suggested that Microsoft is pushing to produce more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/800538/microsoft-surface-manufacturing-china-move-report">Xbox consoles outside of China</a>, in a clear attempt to reduce the impact of the tariffs.</p><p>The short announcement from Microsoft’s Xbox developer relations team makes it clear that this price increase goes into effect immediately. I understand it’s not just impacting US developers, as the price of these development kits is also going up across Europe and elsewhere. That’s likely because those “macroeconomic” conditions extend beyond just US tariffs, with currency fluctuations, production costs, and other elements impacting pricing.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox dev kit was already expensive because it comes with additional hardware on the inside and out, to let developers build and test Xbox games for both the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles. Microsoft has equipped its latest dev kit with 40GB of GDDR6 memory, instead of the 16GB found on the Xbox Series X console. It also has a more compute units enabled, the all-important debugging tools onboard for testing games, and three USB ports at the front. Microsoft also equips its Xbox dev kits with a front panel display and five programmable buttons.</p><div><p>The dev kit price hikes also come just weeks after Microsoft hiked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscription by 50 percent.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, you can use your regular earbuds while gaming, but if you’re after immersive in-game sound with a solid mic that lets you chat with other players clearly, getting your hands on a gaming headset makes sense. Even better, you can snag one for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4904/">Amazon is being generous with a 20% discount on the HyperX CloudX gaming headset, bringing the price down to just $40.</a> The compatibility is impressive, and it offers exceptional comfort for longer sessions. Just note that the retailer has listed the discount as a limited-time one, so you might want to act fast to grab it before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4904/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive In-Game Sound for a Realistic Experience</h2>
<p>For under $50, you’re getting a headset that gives off a premium look and is quite sturdy. Ear cushions are plush, so you won’t need to take these off every couple of hours to give your ears a break. Sound-wise, you will enjoy rich audio and enhanced bass that makes you feel like you’re right in the middle of the action. Subtle footsteps in the background or whispers from the bad guys; you’re going to hear it all clearly.</p>
<p>There’s a detachable noise-cancellation microphone that cuts through background noise – your squad hears you without unwanted distractions. It comes with a flexible braided cable that lets you position the mic in different ways, plus withstands the daily wear and tear well. The mic also pops off when not in use. That way, you can use the headset like normal over-ear headphones whenever you want. Listening to music while working or playing a single-player title where you don’t need to give or take commands? Just take the mic off and you’re good to go.</p>



<p>Tweaking sound settings will be a matter of seconds, too. In-line audio controls make it easy to quickly make adjustments without digging into on-screen menus. As for compatibility, the headset works well with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S controllers. You can also use it with pretty much any device that has a 3.5mm audio jack, whether it’s your PC or a smartphone.</p>
<p>All things considered, this deal is offering a great chance to upgrade your in-game sound experience for less.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4904/"> It was already quite affordable at $60, but Amazon is letting you grab it for $40 for a short time</a>. The offer won’t last long, so be sure to grab it fast.</p>

<p>Despite rumours, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on its previously revealed release date, November 14, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from yesterday stated that there was evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7, with the game arriving a week earlier. However, Treyarch has debunked this claim, revealing that the release date for the upcoming title remains on track. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-to-release-on-november-14-as-planned">Black Ops 7 To Release on November 14 As Planned</h2>



<p>The latest post from Treyarch on <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980670037985042637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses the release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The developers have stated, “We’re less than a month away from #BlackOps7’s launch on November 14,” which clears up any doubts about a potential announcement of a release date change. The post also talks about their newest dev talk dropping today, October 21, along with more juicy multiplayer updates from the beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're less than a month away from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a>'s launch on Nov. 14!</p><p>Our newest Dev Talk drops today with more juicy MP updates coming out of the Beta. 🫡</p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1980670037985042637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Talking about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta, it was revealed that RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">99% of the matches were cheater-free</a>, and cheaters were detected within three matches. This is excellent news for fans of the series, as Call of Duty has been one of the franchise’s biggest victims of in-game cheating. Hopefully, the case remains the same during launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 developers have announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature</a> non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. Additionally, the game didn’t include a Wall Run feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-wall-run-due-to-its-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to its timeline</a>.

Most of the listing on Amazon are above MSRP and higher than secondary market values, but the carosel above are good deals when compared to TCGPlayer.</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at Amazon">MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer's sellers are keeping away from the sneaker-heads and crypo bro mentality that's hit Magic and Pokémon TCG is 2025 and is keeping prices down. Market value for MTG sealed product goes off what people are willing to pay, and it shows. There's so much here that's at a lower price than big box retailers it's embarassing. But, it's great for your pocket!</p><p id="blaziken-ex-volcanion-ex-premium-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium C">Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="688f638e-8444-4126-a204-e1320f401009" id="229712"><div id="229712" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainers and collectors will get five Destined Rivals Boosters and five Journey Together Boosters in this bad boy, so that's about the right kind of ball park for ten booster packs, plus you're getting the promo Volcanion ex and Blaziken ex promo card and a jumbo version of Blaziken ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think these promo's would work great together in a fire-themed deck. Use Blazikens Seething Spirit to grab fire energy from your discard pile to build up Volcanion. In the meantime Volcanion can burn opposing Pokémon then use Scorching Cyclone for 160 damage then transfer all it's energy to a benched Pokémon. So many possibilities here.</p></div><p id="pok-tcg-mega-evolution-in-stock"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Poké TCG: Mega Evolution In Stock">Poké Price Check: Mega Evolution In Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution seems to be a well-printed start to the next era of Pokémon TCG.

Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/lego-toys">LEGO</a>, Hallmark has ventured into licenses and partnerships with companies that make fun things: video games, movies, TV shows, etc. One of the latest new Hallmark Keepsake ornaments for 2025 is one that will have Xbox fans (both current and lapsed) excited to put up their Christmas trees this year. It’s a small, yet intricately detailed, re-creation of the Xbox 360 console. It even plays the Halo theme song when you press the button. It’s available now, for $28.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxAOY?object_uuid=5ff7e42f-d01e-4cdc-a4c3-963e2aa2a1c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox 360 Console with Light and Sound - Hallmark Keepsake Christmas Ornament 2025</h2><div catalogid="00e470b9-e4a4-43fd-9cb6-de849ef7e38e" id="229617"><div id="229617" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox 360 Console with Light and Sound (Plays Halo Theme Song)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 console ornament is 3.25 inches tall. It’s an almost perfectly scaled-down model of the iconic white console that was first released in 2005. The ornament has the console standing up, with a white Xbox 360 controller leaning against it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As indicated by the higher-than-usual price, it’s a “With Light and Sound” ornament. The power button on the console glows green when you press it. It then emits the familiar Xbox 360 startup sound, followed by about 20 seconds of “Behold a Pale Horse,” a song from the Halo 3 soundtrack. You can watch a video of it on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxAOY?object_uuid=5ff7e42f-d01e-4cdc-a4c3-963e2aa2a1c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing page</a>.</p></div><div catalogid="00e470b9-e4a4-43fd-9cb6-de849ef7e38e" id="229615"><div id="229615" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Halo 3 - Master Chief Xbox 360</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, also new this year in the Hallmark Keepsake line is an awesome <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-3-hallmark-christmas-ornament-amazon-buy-2025">Halo 3 ornament</a> that features the game’s box, with Master Chief actually emerging from it, 3D-style. It’s one of the coolest ornaments I’ve ever seen. Both of these are like a blast of nostalgia for anyone who had an Xbox 360. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick, but the Xbox 360 is in the running for my favorite console of all time, and these ornaments bring me right back to those golden days of gaming. The Xbox 360 paved the way for so many things we take for granted these days, from easy online play to huge open-world games. And even though the console came out 20 years ago, that’s the platform Grand Theft Auto V debuted on, a game that’s still relevant today in the lead-up to the sequel. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More New 2025 Hallmark Keepsake Ornaments</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other new ornaments to choose from, including this awesome (yet pricy!) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-new-100-star-wars-hallmark-ornament-requires-a-separate-power-cord-purchase">Star Wars ornament</a> that requires a power cord that's sold separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/eufys-2k-security-camera-hits-40-off-amazon-liquidates-stock-with-bonus-coupon-2000637652</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eufy%E2%80%99s-2k-security-camera-hits-40-off-amazon-liquidates-stock-with-bonus-coupon.1330639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wiring outdoor security cameras means drilling through walls, fishing cables through attics, hiring electricians and accepting permanent placement decisions you’ll regret six months later when you realize the angle is wrong. The <strong>Eufy security SoloCam S220</strong> solves all of that with a completely wireless design powered by a built-in solar panel that keeps itself charged indefinitely.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/">dropped it to an all-time low of $59 after applying both the automatic 35% discount and an additional on-page coupon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. For homeowners tired of package thieves, this represents the easiest path to outdoor surveillance that actually works.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The solar charging eliminates the largest headache with wireless cameras: battery anxiety. Older battery-powered wireless cameras must be recharged every few weeks or even months, requiring you to pull out ladders and break up coverage precisely when coverage is needed most. The <strong>unit power is fueled with only three hours of sunlight per day to keep it fully charged indefinitely</strong>. The <strong>built-in solar panel is flush-mounted</strong> on top of the camera enclosure so that no separate panel is needed to be mounted and no wires are needed to be run between modules. Even during short winter days when sunlight is scarce, the capacity of the battery reserves is enough to sustain recording through several weeks’ worth of cloudiness without maintenance.</p>
<h2>2K Resolution</h2>
<p>Video resolution is a direct factor in whether content is functional or simply for ornamentation’s sake. The <strong>2K resolution used here equates to 2304 x 1296 pixels</strong>, much clearer than 1080p standard-resolution cameras which top out at 1920 x 1080. The increased resolution means you can indeed <strong>read license plates from 20 feet distant</strong> or make out facial features well enough for police purposes.</p>



<p>The f/1.6 aperture owes more to image quality than most spec sheets describe. Aperture determines how much light reaches the sensor, with lower numbers meaning more light reaches it. An f/1.6 specification is outstanding for security webcams, which are usually around f/2.0 or larger. This larger aperture paired with infrared LEDs provides<strong> valuable night vision that reveals detail in almost complete darkness</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>AI detection system</strong> differentiates this from ordinary motion-activated cameras that buzz your phone every time a leaf moves by. The onboard processor interprets patterns of movement to differentiate humans from animals, cars, and natural movement such as swaying branches. You are only alerted when real people come into view, minimizing notification fatigue significantly. The camera is connected to Eufy’s HomeBase 3 hub for advanced facial tracking that can distinguish between your family members, regular package deliverers, and unfamiliar guests, although the camera operates fully without the hub on standard human detection.</p>



<p><strong>Installation requires approximately 15 minutes overall</strong>. The miniature housing is approximately 3 inches in diameter, small enough to be installed inconspically under eaves or on fence posts without appearing to be overt surveillance gear. Since it’s wire-free, you drill a single mounting hole, place the supplied anchor, and twist on the camera itself. The magnetic base lets you make angle adjustments without tools so that you can tweak your view after reviewing initial coverage.</p>
<p>Both discounts applied at $59 means you are paying well under many indoor cams but receive weatherproof build rated for outdoor use, solar charging which means no maintenance needed, and AI detection that works.</p>

                <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is launching an investigation into developer Roblox Corporation, alleging that the online game creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is a "breeding ground" for predators that enables child abuse.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-issues-criminal-subpoenas-roblox-protect-children" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a press release</a> from the Republican's office, Uthmeier said he and his team will be issuing Roblox Corporation "criminal subpoenas" for "profiting off of our kids and exposing them to the most dangerous of harms." This investigation will allow Uthmeier to determine whether the company's action or inaction aids child abuse.</p><p>"Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids," Uthmeier said in an October 20 video posted to X. "These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on the Roblox platform, as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are issuing criminal subpoenas to Roblox, which has become a breeding ground for predators to gain access to our kids. <a href="https://t.co/vcyTVnkrxU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/vcyTVnkrxU</a></p>  — Attorney General James Uthmeier (@AGJamesUthmeier) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Roblox has faced scrutiny over its child safety, particularly <span>following <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" rel="nofollow ">a</a></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> June 2024 Bloomberg report</a> that found the platform has a rampant pedophile problem.

Nearly 40% of Roblox's users are under the age of 13, and although Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik said the recent negative press towards the game is based on events from "<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">five years ago</a>," these lawsuits were filed this year.</p><p>This is what prompted Uthmeier to investigate Roblox Corporation. He explained in <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/2025-0909_roblox.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the full subpoena</a> that, through the multiple investigations revealing that predators are grooming minors with the in-game currency Robux, the company must face justice.</p><p>"At the end of the day, we will stop at nothing to fight to protect our kids," he said. "And companies that act carelessly and expose them to harm will be held accountable."</p><p>Roblox Corporation now must respond to the subpoena and appear before Tampa, Florida's assistant statewide prosecutor Rita Pavan Peters on December 20.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Frogwares has revealed that its upcoming horror game&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will be delayed into next year, and it's all down to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Frogwares says that although it technically hasn't announced a release window for the survival horror sequel, it acknowledges that both its fans and Frogwares itself "were expecting a 2025 launch".</p>

<p>However, thanks to "frequent drone and missile attacks, incoming power outages, and the need to adapt to unstable conditions" owing to Russian attacks on Ukraine, Frogwares says it needs additional development time to "finish the game properly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sinking-city-2-delayed-tentacles.jpg?itok=MZTJjs4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sinking-city-2-delayed-tentacles.jpg?itok=AUtXFaPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>won't be launching in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the rather grim reason for the delay, Frogwares says that additional time will also allow it to "polish [its] first-ever survival horror experience";&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>won't be an investigative adventure game like the studio's usual fare, but a classic survival horror title instead.</p>

<p>Frogwares promises that the extra time will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>"tense, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling in all the right ways", promising to honor the survival horror genre's focus on "tension, pacing, combat, and atmosphere".</p>

<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in March 2024 during that month's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partner-preview-recap-check-out-all-news-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">Xbox Partner Preview</a> showcase. Like the first game, it promises to deliver "a distinct atmosphere of cosmic horror and twisted designs" inspired by the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.</p>

<p>Unlike the first title, however,&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will focus on survival horror mechanics; Frogwares promises "inventory management, optional puzzles, and backtracking to newly unlocked areas and hidden treasures", just like the genre's stalwarts.</p>




<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825860/The_Sinking_City_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009208" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-european-game-devs-quarter-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-report-alleges-over-a-quarter-of-european-game-devs-lost-their-jobs-this-year.1330606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that over a quarter of people working in the gaming industry in Europe have lost their jobs over the last twelve months or so, with many of those affected still looking for work.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/over-26-of-european-game-professionals-were-laid-off-in-the-past-year-more-than-10-still-searching-for-jobs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the latest Big Games Industry Employment Survey reports that over 26% of workers in game development in Europe have been laid off over the last year or so, and 10.4% of that number are still searching for a new job.</p>

<p>According to the survey, the most commonly-affected areas for layoffs are design, art, and QA testing, and those on the creative side of the industry "also felt the least secure in their roles". Perhaps unsurprisingly, management, HR, and analytics felt a much stronger sense of job security.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-industry-europe-layoffs-report-office.jpg?itok=O-B75yie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-industry-europe-layoffs-report-office.jpg?itok=DTc-9xz0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Developers across Europe are losing their jobs at a rate of knots, apparently. Sony Santa Monica shown only for illustrative purposes.</figcaption></figure><p>Salaries for many jobs across Europe have fallen as well, including programming, project management, and recruitment. Naturally, that also means salary satisfaction is lower than it was last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the survey also found that the gender pay gap is very much alive and well in the gaming industry, with huge gaps between men and women in areas like the C-suite executive level and project management.</p>

<p>That disparity extends to diversity and inclusion initiatives as well; the report found that the majority of studios polled don't have dedicated DEI specialists, and that number has risen since last year as well.</p>

<p>Generally, this year's Big Games Industry Employment Survey does not paint a particularly positive picture of the industry, but given the sheer amount of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shutdowns</a> over the last few years, that's hardly surprising.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/funcom-european-game-developer-layoffs.jpg?itok=Yqj8hVBW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/funcom-european-game-developer-layoffs.jpg?itok=AY5KVBjG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many European studios, like Norwegian outfit Funcom, have let employees go over the last twelve months.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of the studios laying employees off, whether that be in Europe or elsewhere, aren't exactly struggling.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has proven a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">very successful project</a> for Funcom, but the studio decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">lay employees off earlier this month</a> anyway. Similarly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> at Xbox don't seem to be down to any performance lull on the studio's part, as its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue grew this fiscal year</a>.</p>

            <p>Frogwares have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-reveal-wet-survival-horror-sequel-the-sinking-city-2-taking-the-dev-in-a-newer-direction-in-2025">delayed the release</a> of Lovecraftian survival horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> to the first half of 2026, citing the effects of developing a game in amid the war between Russia and Ukraine as having understandably affected how long it's taken to get things done. There's no concrete new date as of right now, but the studio have shared some work-in-progress screens.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares publishing head Sergiy Oganesyan said of <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/">the delay</a>. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn.</p>
<p>"You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning. These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time."</p>
<p>"We don’t have an exact date set for 2026 yet, but we thought it was better to at least share what we do know," he added. "We’d rather be certain than announce something now only to move it again. Rest assured, we’re currently aiming for the first half of 2026, so it’s a matter of months, not years."</p><p>Alongside the 13 fresh screenshots the team have shared as part of the delay announcement, some of which I've included below, Frogwares' senior social media manager Anna Bieniek said that the studio are planning to show off "a lot more gameplay over the next few months to let everyone see how development is going".</p>



<p>The devs add that the extra time will give them leeway to ensure they've stuck the landing as well as they'd link in their switch from detective-style action to full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">survival horror</a>, which has been "a whole new kind of challenge".</p>
<p>Our Alice B had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-review-pc">mixed thoughts</a> on the original Sinking City, summing them up thusly:</p>
<blockquote>Without the weird Lovecraftian bits, this is a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town. Taking them into account, I don’t know! I was confused and uncharmed by the whole thing, but I still haven’t untangled my brainnoodles. At least I’ve told you how they got tangled. Goodness, I was very interested in The Sinking City. I really wanted to love it. But I’m afraid rain may have stopped play this time.</blockquote>
<p>Solidarity to Frogwares' devs as they carry on working get their game over the line in very tough circumstances.</p>

            <p>
Mere moments before release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been delayed by the occult implosion of developers The Chinese Room, seemingly triggered by a last-ditch request from Paradox Interactive to add a microtransaction system and start charging for every bitten neck. 
</p>
<p>
There is nothing left of The Chinese Room now. Nothing but a huge bubble of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMy885mRf-s">Cromwell invocations</a> and bisexual lighting, right in the middle of Portsmouth. Occasionally, a level designer erupts from the congealing iridescent surface, begging to be allowed to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> 2 instead, only to be dragged back into the orb by a thousand, vermillion-painted fingers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Prior to becoming a gore singularity, Bloodlines 2's developers had been poised to celebrate the fateful release of a game synonymous with development hell. Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">announced in 2019</a>. Back then, it was in development at Hardsuit Labs, with original Bloodlines creator Brian Mitsoda as narrative lead and former RPS columnist Cara Ellison as senior writer. It all seemed rather brilliant. It even earned itself the coveted double <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2s-vampires-are-goofy-dancers-preview">Caldbell</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-love-you-scary-lady-of-the-latest-bloodlines-2-demo">Thumbs-Up</a> from Alice Bee and Brendy (RPS in peace). 
</p>
<p>
Much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-bloodlines-2-explains-thinbloods-and-their-powers">ink</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/malkavians-confirmed-for-bloodlines-2-we-talked-to-brian-mitsoda-on-the-new-clan-reveal">was</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2s-dialogue-system-looks-more-subtle-than-the-original">spilled</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-us-do-a-stealthy-bitey-run-in-this-deep-demo-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Some videos</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-e3-gameplay-video">were made</a>. But then everything went sideways. In August 2020, Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-into-2021">announced a delay</a>. Then, they suddenly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">got rid of Mitsoda</a>. Then, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">tore the project from the hands of Hardsuit Labs</a>, who subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-hit-with-layoffs">laid off staff</a>. All this in the name of "doing the game justice". Mitsoda had a different take, as you'd expect. "I was not part of the conversations that led to the decision to delay production, and to my knowledge, there were no delays caused by the Bloodlines 2 narrative development," he wrote at the time of his departure from the project. "I am confident and proud of the work that I and my team put forward." 
</p><p>
Paradox apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-considered-cancelling-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">considered cancelling the game</a>, but eventually handed it over to a secret third party <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">later revealed to be The Chinese Room</a>. Then came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-is-refunding-all-pre-orders-for-bloodlines-2">preorder refunds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">more delays</a>, an interview with us in which Paradox suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">Bloodlines 2 isn't really a Bloodlines game at all</a>, a wholly unforced bit of rake-stepping in which Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">decided</a> and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-controversial-dlc-clans-will-be-in-the-base-game-after-all">undecided</a> to paywall two vampire factions, some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-hours-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-uncloak-a-slick-action-game-but-a-limited-rpg">promising Dishonored comparisons</a>, and finally, our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a>, in which Dominic Tarason deemed the game "an entertaining but flawed vampire brawler wrapped in a compelling mystery story". Whatever you may think of Paradox's treatment of Hardsuit, The Chinese Room appear to have fashioned a decent action bonanza from what they were given, despite being mostly known for games about walking and talking.
</p>
<p>
I was intrigued to play it, but alas, no more. Every server harbouring a copy of Bloodlines 2 has exploded into bony dust. Every screen carrying its image has peeled away from the monitor, folded itself into a pair of batwings and flown out the nearest window. In vain do I direct you towards <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/">Steam</a>, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_bloodlines_2">GOG</a> - clicking those store links will simply cause the earth to open and swallow you up. Bloodlines 2 was clearly a project too strange and beautiful for this world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it comes to vlogging, the right tools can both elevate your content and make your workflow easier. The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 does both. Keep your phone in your pocket and use this dedicated vlogging camera to capture your footage. The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 vlogging camera is designed with YouTubers, TikTokers, and InstagramReelers in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/">Plus, right now, Amazon has the camera discounted by 27%. It’s normally listed at $799, but for a limited time, that price has been cut down to just $585. That will save you whole $214.</a></p>
<p>So why reach for the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 over your phone? Your phone is a camera after all. Heck, it’s a pretty good one. The iPhone 16 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 both have remarkable photography and videography capability, but there’s something they don’t have — unlimited storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That’s not to say the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 has unlimited storage, but it does use MicroSD. You can stock up on as many as you need with as large capacities as you need. And more importantly, keep them separate from your day-to-day stuff you are recording on your phone. That’s important for digital horders like me who constantly find themselves needing to delete old videos just to take a selfie.</p>
<h2>Impressive Videography</h2>
<p>While SD cards aren’t the main selling point here, the specs are. This camera shoots stunning footage in 4K resolution at up to 120 fps. That means you can slow your recordings down in the editing bay to slow-mo.</p>
<p>Keep your audience captivated with dynamic footage that follow your subject. The les is on a swivel which can auto-focus to your main point or person of interest and then track them as the move. It uses an advanced three-axis mechanical stabilization to help remove any shakiness that would be in your video otherwise.</p>



<p>The camera can be turned to point forward or backward. So you can be the person behind the camera, following along with the built in display, or have it turned facing you to record selfie footage while seeing how everything looks in frame.</p>
<p>The mini-display measures on inch across, has touch controls, and can be pivoted either vertical or horizontal. This way you can record for the audience your video is intended.</p>
<p>Advanced color-grading tech is working behind the scenes to capture in 10-bit color depth, recoding up to one billion colors. You’re achieve impressive visual quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/">For a limited time, you can grab yourself the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 vlogging camera for a reduced price. Amazon has the camera discounted by 27% off.</a></p>

<section><p>Silent Hill has always been about overcoming psychological terrors in the face of real world anxieties, and there’s no reason it should be beholden to a singular setting or formula.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Over the course of its 26-year history, the Silent Hill series has built up a reputation for offering deep dives into the more psychological side of the survival horror genre and giving players complex stories and experiences that often resonate more deeply than those found in the genre’s action-focused contemporaries. This complexity, however, doesn't mean the series is without formula. By and large, this formula generally consists of taking a tortured or doubting protagonist, placing them in the titular town covered with fog, and allowing the monsters of their mind (or cults) to envelop them to help them discover or face their transgressions. It’s a setup that’s worked time and time again for Konami, and it’s what gamers have come to expect from the beloved series.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, I find that Silent Hill works best when it takes more risks with that established formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Take, for example, the premise of the fourth entry, Silent Hill 4: The Room. The game saw players take on the role of Henry Townshend, another "tortured or doubting protagonist" forced to confront their own internal distress. But while this part of the equation remained the same, gone was the titular town. Gone was the cult that played a large presence in the first and third entries. Gone was the series' trademark fog.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Townshend spends the game trapped in a nightmarish version of his apartment--one that players are forced to thoroughly explore before being sent to a hellish landscape and undergoing a perspective shift. What The Room offered was a different take on the psychological horror story that, while similar to Silent Hill 2, brought with it new gameplay ideas that involved shifting perspectives and escort missions. It was taking expectations for a Silent Hill game and throwing them out the window in pursuit of new ideas that could move the series forward and redefine what a Silent Hill experience is.</p><p dir="ltr">Then all went quiet for a few years, and we got more traditional (and far less interesting) entries such as Silent Hill: Origins, Silent Hill: Homecoming, and Silent Hill Downpour. The series hadn’t fully stagnated just yet, but none of these entries felt like they were moving the series forward in any meaningful way. Instead, they felt like they were trying to mimic the aesthetics and story delivery of the original three games. They had the town of Silent Hill, tortured male protagonists and perspectives, and copious amounts of fog.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588693" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588693"></a><figcaption>A disturbing figure waits at the end of a hallway in this grainy still from P.T.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then in 2014, P.T. came along, and was seemingly the creative shot in the arm that Silent Hill needed. Directed by Hideo Kojima, P.T. had players traverse and down the same hallway over and over uncovering a story about family murder, discovering a bloody fetus in the bathroom sink, and encountering a ghastly creature named Lisa. Not long after its release, however, P.T. was revealed to be a small look at a cancelled game titled Silent Hills. Yet despite the teaser being both cryptic and cancelled, it arguably pushed Silent Hill into new, uncomfortable territory for the franchise, and provided players with a small taste of something that could never be.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, the series was dormant, without a mainline entry for over a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2024, however, Konami resurrected Silent Hill, delivering a full remake of Silent Hill 2 that expanded on some elements from the original. But while this remake was well-made and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">critically-acclaimed</a>, it ultimately was treading territory that the series had seen before. It became clear that if we wanted something truly <em>new </em>from Silent Hill, we'd be waiting a bit longer. Fortunately, it didn't take long for Konami to deliver.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Silent Hill f spoilers to follow--read at your own discretion.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Enter Silent Hill f, which launched just this past month. The newest entry in the series, SHF takes Silent Hill out of the titular town and sets it instead in 1960s Japan. Its setting alone is a far cry from the Twin Peaks-esque view of middle America that the series is usually known for, trading hotels, diners, and record stores for schools, shrines, and awe-inspiring temples. The newest entry also adopts a “Silent Hill is a state of mind” approach, engulfing its small Japanese town setting in the trademark fog giving it the tension-filled sense of directionlessness. It feels familiar but strange all at once.</p><p dir="ltr">That feeling carries over to the narrative as well. Being set in 1960s Japan the game tackles topics of misogyny and the expectations for women at the time to be obedient housewives who must give up large parts of their identity in the pursuit of serving their husbands. Hinako is expected to marry a partner that’s preselected for her, taking away her free will and bodily autonomy. Whereas previous Silent Hill protagonists are psychologically tortured because of actions and choices they’ve made, Hinako is thrust into a situation she had no say in that drives her to near madness.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Silent Hill series has featured a female protagonist before, its feminist themes have never been quite this prominent. SHF and its various endings show the outcomes of not merely Hinako's "bad" choices, but all of the bad choices made for her. From being driven to murderous madness, drug addiction and acceptance, and even an ending in which she reclaims her free will to pursue a relationship naturally, Silent Hill f demonstrates how the series doesn't need to hone in on guilt, shame, and sin to pack a punch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588694"></a><figcaption>Hinako kneels on bloodied ground in Silent Hill f.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to new themes, the game also dives into the more ethereal elements of the series by having segments set in the spirit world. While this is not a first for the series, Silent Hill f gives it a unique spin by spotlighting Japanese folklore, shrines, and temples, giving the entire experience a more eastern religious feeling. This is a far cry from the way religion has been depicted in past entries, which have traditionally leaned into cults and other satanic-inspired entities.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill is a horror game series where the possibilities are endless. And while Konami has a tried-and-true formula established that has carried the series throughout most of its life, Silent Hill truly shines when it takes risks with the established formula. Silent Hill has always been about overcoming psychological terrors in the face of real world anxieties and life expectations. There’s no reason it should always be beholden to a singular setting or formula.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We are so stoked to reveal that Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will grace the cover of the December issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine! <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">Subscribe today</a> to receive this issue when it launches digitally on November 4, with physical issues hitting mailboxes in the weeks following. Like all subscribers, you'll also receive complete access to all our digital archive of past <em>Game Informer</em> issues to explore at your leisure.&nbsp;</p><p>Today is a very special day for <em>Game Informer</em>, too, because this is the first time ever (<strong>somehow</strong>) that we've had a Dragon Quest game on the cover in our more than 30 years of history. This issue highlights both Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and, in a feature accompanying the cover story, the history of the Dragon Quest franchise, going all the way back to 1986.</p><p>This issue's cover image showcases the new and, dare we say, reimagined look of Dragon Quest VII in this new remake from Square Enix. Square Enix worked with a local premium doll maker to create real-life dolls of the protagonist Hero and their accompanying party, and then scanned them into the game. This approach, alongside the team's work to recreate Estard and the surrounding locales to resemble handcrafted dioramas, gives the entire package a cozy and unique look. That's reflected in the cover image below, which features Prince Kiefer, Hero, and Maribel trying to avoid the gaze of a dangerous golem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the story itself, video editor Alex Van Aken and I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to visit Square Enix's new Shibuya office, play the game for a few hours, and interview the team behind it. We also interviewed a key figure of this long-running franchise for more than 90 minutes, but you'll have to wait a bit longer to hear more about that! We have plenty more to say when the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue launches digitally next month, as we'll be posting exclusive articles and videos all month long, but it's safe to say we had a great time and are looking forward to sharing more about this remake.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It seems as though everyone is fighting to create the most popular extraction game right now, with games like Arc Raiders, Marathon, Escape from Tarkov and more battling each other for the crown. However, another challenger has waddled in from out of nowhere: Escape from Duckov.</p>
<p>Escape from Duckov is a PvE extraction game where you must roam around a map, grab as much loot as you can, then extract from the area without getting killed and losing all your ill-gotten goods. The twist? You're a duck. In fact, it's all ducks. It's ducks with guns and knives murking each other.</p>
<p>Created by Team Soda, a Bilibili game studio, the game launched to Steam on the 16th October. Since then, it has quickly risen in players, shooting up to a peak of roughly 61,000 after one day, before continuing the climb up to its current peak (as of writing) of 221,963.</p>

<p>For those unaware, the name Escape from Duckov is a play on Escape from Tarkov, arguably the first major extraction shooter in its popular form. That game is due to get its own Steam release in November, so perhaps Duckov will give eager fans something to pond-er over in the meantime. Sorry.
</p><p>Currently on sale for £15.83 / $15.83 / €15.83, the game has landed at the number three spot across global top sellers on Steam, behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>. Not bad for a game that just swam onto the platform a few days ago.</p>
<p>Escape from Duckov is spreading its wings just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-already-has-servers-slammed-by-almost-100000-players-in-two-hours-as-weekend-playtest-starts">Arc Raiders concluded its own server slam play test</a>, and right before Marathon is due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">have its next closed technical test following a shaky first impression</a>. Strictly speaking Escape from Duckov as a PvE game isn't strictly a competitor to these releases despite its cheeky name, but who knows? Maybe Escape from Duckov will continue to do well in these harsh digital waters.</p>
