            <p>They get knocked down, but they get up again, and you’re apparently never going to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> studio CCP Games from trying to make an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the universe of their Excel(lent?) MMO happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-vanguard">EVE Vanguard</a> - the studio's admirable fourth crack at it - was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">last September</a>. Since then, it’s had several open betas and, according to a new and rather vague roadmap, should release sometime post this coming November. Here’s said infographic - more pork scratching-stained napkin scrawl than sat-nav.</p>

</figure>
<p>As you can see, the roadmap as it stands is effectively a yawping gap charting the time between now and the last open beta event, although there are a few details for plans (though not dates) moving forward. The wishlist includes establishing more economic links between the shooter and their long running MMO, which I still find very cool conceptually despite having no real interest in either. Also planned are more weapon customisation options, “diverse environments”, more progression options, and “expanded gameplay elements” which, y’know, you’d hope so yeah.</p>
<p>The intervening time between now and November-ish will also host a bunch of closed founder tests, culminating in a major update on the 16th of November, and dev diaries such as the below "future visions" trailer, which makes a few comparisions with CCP's previous FPS Dust 514.</p>

<p>As noted, EVE Vanguard is only the latest in a series of attempts at grafting a standalone shooter to the wildly successful and undeniably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-accidental-jump-later-one-of-eves-biggest-battles">storied</a> MMO. Dust 514 launched in 2013 for PlayStation 3, and shut down a few years later. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-legion-fps-announced">Project Legion</a> was announced in 2014, but never saw the light of day. In 2018, CCP were kind enough to fly me to Vegas to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-project-nova-2018">show off Project Nova</a>, but that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ccp-cancel-project-nova-but-havent-given-up-on-an-eve-online-shooter">canceled in 2020</a>. Vanguard has neither numbers or the words ‘Project’ in the title, so maybe it’ll fare better?</p>
<p>Last October, Julian Benson wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">why CCP haven't stopped trying to make an EVE Online shooter for 15 years</a>. “I can’t say if Vanguard will be what the team’s looked for for so long, but it has two things going for it that give it a greater prospect of success,” wrote Benson. “EVE Vanguard is described by CCP as a module of EVE rather than its own game, not because they run in the same engine but because you launch both through the same client. CCP are trying hard to make sure even if Vanguard develops its own player base, they will be well aware of its ties to EVE Online. Secondly is the ‘vE’ in Vanguard’s PvPvE’s pitch. Even if you were the only player in the world who booted up Vanguard, there would be a game for you to play.”</p>

            <p>
Piranha Bytes, the Embracer-owned German studio behind the Gothic, Risen and ELEX series, has reportedly shut down. 
</p>
<p>
The embattled publisher Embracer had been seeking a buyer for Piranha Bytes as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">vast and brutal swathe of cost-cutting</a> that saw multiple studios shut and more than 4500 people lose their jobs - though ultimately was unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>
Job losses at Piranha Bytes were first reported at the end of last year and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-studio-piranha-bytes-acknowledges-difficult-situation-as-it-faces-potential-closure">company acknowledged earlier this year "a difficult situation"</a> as it faced potential closure. Now a fresh report today by German website <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/piranha-bytes-zukunft-bjoern-pankratz-pithead-studio,3416007.html">GameStar</a> has confirmed the studio formally shut at the end of June, with its leaders now founding a new indie studio.

<p>
Pithead Studio, as the fresh indie outfit is named, has been founded by Piranha Bytes' Björn Pankratz and Jennifer Pankratz to continue their former studio's focus on role-playing games. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, Pithead Studio officially announced its existence with a post on X, and released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCOIsrbctNM">YouTube</a> video discussing what's next.
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
"We founded a new studio last Thursday named Pithead Studio," they say, explaining the name as a nod to the mine shaft entrances found in their local region. 
</p>
<p>
Details on what exactly happened in the final weeks and months of Piranha Bytes are thin on the ground, though the pair promise to explain more in further videos, set to be published on their YouTube channel each Monday.
</p>
<p>As for Embracer, meanwhile, in April the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">announced its plan to split into three companies</a>, including "Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends".</p>

			<p>A PlayStation 5 dev kit was sold online for a rather high price, and the seller had to be clever to avoid having it delisted by Sony.</p>
<p>As reported by Consolevariations on<a href="https://x.com/consolevariant/status/1808894091784245252"> X/Twitter</a>, a dev kit was recently sold for the whopping price of $6000. To avoid the item from getting delisted, the seller disguised the system as a PizzaStation 5 development kit, making fun of its V-shaped design, which was also picked on by many when the first images of the dev kit surfaced online in 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Someone sold a PS5 Dev kit as an "PlayStation Pizza kit" and it worked.. it was sold for 6K</p>
<p>High likely to avoid being delisted from Sony from selling his development kit</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PizzaStation.png"></a></figure>

<p>— consolevariations (@consolevariant) <a href="https://twitter.com/consolevariant/status/1808894091784245252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite being available only for developers, multiple PlayStation 5 dev kits have made it into the hands of regular users. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-dev-kit-design-and-features-showcased-in-new-video/">2022</a>, we also got a good look at the dev kit's unique features, which are obviously not available on the retail system.</p>
<p>Considering how many looks we have had at the PlayStation 5 dev kit, it wouldn't be surprising to get more than a few of them at the PS5 Pro dev kit. The mid-generation hardware refresh from Sony, which will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">enhanced specs, better ray tracing performance, and support for the Playstation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>, is said to be released between the end of 2024 and the first few months of 2025. With rumors abound of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-september/">PlayStation Showcase planned for September</a>, it is very likely we will finally learn more about the system in the near future.</p>

<p>Deliver Us Home is getting a new chance at life.</p>



<p>KeokeN has announced that the game, which was in development at the studio before all of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deliver-us-mars-developer-keoken-lays-off-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees were laid off</a> in April has been restarted. The development is being done by a “group of volunteers” with the support of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">backing on Kickstarter</a>.</p>



<p>“Taking matters into our own hands again after years of pitching feels very liberating,” CEO Koen Deetman said via release, “and it has motivated us to work extremely hard over the past few weeks. We’ve been running on all cylinders to orchestrate the campaign, the trailer, and the demo that backers get to play. It truly is a token of our love and dedication to science-fiction and the craft of making video games.”</p>



<p>To go along with the Kickstarter, the team also released a prototype demo of Deliver Us Home. The Demo will become available to players in the near future after the campaign concludes.</p>



<p>As of posting, the Kickstarter, which runs until July 11, has raised $88,775 with a goal of $108,315. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-time-to-make-your-own-pizza.921474/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hey-you-make-a-pizza<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, I got up at 8am on a Sunday to make a pizza. <em>Why did you have to get up that early to make a pizza</em>? you might ask, followed by, <em>Why would you </em>make<em> a pizza when you can just buy a better one</em>? I am here to answer your questions. I am here to tell you that you should make your own pizza, even if it will never look like the ones on the cooking blogs or the ones you can buy literally everywhere, because when you make your own pizza, you can make any kind of pizza you want.</p><p>Case in point: I had to get up at 8am on a Sunday because I decided I was going to make a sourdough pizza crust and top it with squash blossom pesto, cherry tomato confit, and burrata. Sounds fancy, doesn’t it, like something you would pay a lot for at some fancy bistro. But the ingredients were easy to source at my local farmer’s market and not notably costly–burrata was even on sale at the grocery store. The only reason I had to get up so early was that the <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sourdough crust</a> takes a while to rise, but I blitzed up the <a href="https://therunawayspoon.com/2011/07/squash-blossom-pesto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pesto</a> and prepared the <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/salt-fat-acid-heat-excerpt-samin-nosrat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomatoes</a> while it rose, and then went on with my day until the pizza was ready to cook.</p><p>How was it? Well, I lost track of time during the crust’s second proof and was worried I’d ruined it, but it came out with a crispy exterior and soft interior that was a bit like focaccia, with just the right sourness. The squash blossom pesto is a great orange color, with a vegetal note that makes the pizza–dare I say–intriguing, and the tomato confit adds a bright yet tempered burst of flavor. Between the burrata and the oil from the confit, things are a bit wet; I wish it were less soggy in the middle, but I figured this would happen. (I’m not above admitting that I blotted the pizza with a ton of paper towels before putting it away.) Is it restaurant-quality? No. Is it pretty? Nope. But is it good? Yeah, man! Look how I just described a pizza I made! Who cares what it looks like?</p><p>Here is where the first barrier to homemade pizza comes in: you are probably not going to be able to make a pizza as pretty as the ones they make at restaurants. Despite considering myself a pretty solid baker, I am <em>abysmal</em> at anything involving shaping a dough. I tend to make my pizzas square, using a half sheet pan, because it’s more forgiving shape-wise. I almost <em>never</em> get it even; some spots are always too thick, and some are always too thin, and I can never figure out how far toward the edge to spread the toppings. But whatever! I have a theory that regular people, like you and me, tend to feel bad about how our cooking looks because we only see images of food made by professional chefs or bloggers. What does a pizza <em>actually</em> look like? It looks like whatever pizza you made.</p><p>The other, more challenging barrier, is that you will <em>never</em> make a pizza in your home oven as good as the ones in restaurants. Your home oven does not get hot enough evenly enough, and its actual temperature is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/10/18/oven-temperature-calibrate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total mystery</a>. You could buy a standalone pizza oven, or a pizza stone, and I will totally support you in doing those things and be a bit jealous of you. But what I do is: I just cook the pizza. I know my oven’s quirks, and I’ve found that my sweet spot is to cook my pizza near the bottom of the oven at about 475 for somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes. I throw some cornmeal on my pan to keep the bottom from sticking, and I keep an eye on things near the end, sitting on the floor and staring through my oven window like I’m watching a cooking show. It doesn’t always work; bits burn sometimes, and it will never have the blistered spots and evenness of a professionally-made pizza, but these tradeoffs are worth the benefit.</p><p>And what is that benefit? It’s that you can make <em>any kind of pizza your heart desires, any time you want</em>. I cannot overstate how this will change your life. Imagine something, anything, that could conceivably be good or at least interesting on a pizza. Before, you might have scanned the menus of restaurants near you, or sighed wistfully at your dream pizza, never to be. But now, here in this blog, I give you the permission–nay, the <em>order</em>–to just go make the damn pizza. Get the ingredients, try it out, see if it works.</p><p>My very first pizza, with wild mushrooms, was a damp, tasteless disaster. But it taught me a couple things: one is that if you have wet ingredients, like mushrooms, you should cook them first. The other is to be very judicious with your cheese and sauce; you need way less than you think. You’ll feel weird about this when prepping your pizza, thinking it will be dry and dissatisfying, but trust me, it’ll be fine. Too much cheese and sauce will make your pizza a soggy bummer. Exercise restraint.</p><p>Since that first failure (which wasn’t really a failure; I ate it the next day for breakfast and it was cold breakfast pizza, God’s greatest gift), I’ve gotten better. If I’m not doing sourdough, I usually use <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-pizza-crust-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this dough recipe</a> from the ever-reliable Sally’s Baking Addiction, which has the benefit of making two crusts, so you can freeze one for later. I prefer to make my own pizza sauce, with canned tomatoes or fresh if it’s the summer, but you can also just buy some. (Bonus tip: <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/is-there-a-difference-between-pizza-sauce-and-pasta-sauce-hell-yes-257877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza sauce is different than pasta sauce</a>!) You’re also not bound by sauce: you can do pesto, as I did yesterday, or jam, or harissa, or curry, or no sauce at all.</p><p>Here are some pizzas I have made, dreamed up from the fertile wilds of my heart and the occasional recipe for inspiration:</p><ul><li><span>Brussel sprouts and veggie bacon&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Duck confit with homemade cherry barbeque sauce</span></li><li><span>Whole squash blossoms, zucchini ribbons, and burrata</span></li><li><span>Fig jam, prosciutto, and gorgonzola&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Corn and blistered shishito peppers</span></li><li><span>Mixed summer squash and heirloom tomatoes</span></li></ul><p>Do they sound good? Do they sound like folly? They are both! Not all of them were successes (the veggie bacon was a bad choice, though it was offset by the crispy brussel sprouts), but I was very happy to eat them all, because a mediocre pizza you pay for is an indignity, but one you make yourself is elevated by your labor and ambitions. Each one was a learning experience, opening the door to even bigger pizza dreams. All of them were ugly as sin, but that only matters when I post them on social media, and <em>you do not have to post photos of your pizzas on social media</em>. They can be your private pleasures; maybe ugly, maybe weird, but unique. They are <em>your pizzas</em>, invented and brought into being by you, because pizza does not belong to the fancy pizza place or the greasy dollar slice store that doesn’t sell pizza for a dollar anymore anyway. It belongs to us all.&nbsp;</p><p>Let go of your preconceived notions of who is worthy of making a pizza and who is not. You are a living being on this earth, with as much right to make a pizza upon it as anyone else. Make manifest pizzas humankind has not yet dared to dream of. The power is within you.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, director Hideki Kamiya has said. Had it been more successful, its developer Clover "would have probably continued" - rather than shutting down the following year.
</p>
<p>
Kamiya discussed the development of Okami with Ikumi Nakamura for the YouTube channel of her new studio Unseen. The pair worked together for the first time on the Zelda-like adventure game.
</p>
<p>
Okami has received plenty of cult acclaim since its release on PS2 in 2006, but was one of only a handful of games made by the Capcom-owned studio before it was dissolved.

<p>
Discussing his recipe for success, Kamiya said in the video: "There is no secret recipe". The pair agreed they haven't succeeded purely in terms of sales.
</p>
<p>
"Even Okami, did it make 150,000 units?" asked Kamiya. "The initial shipment was 90,000. It was a huge failure. If it had been successful, Clover would have probably continued."
</p>
<p>
He admitted: "For us who made it, it turned out something we can be proud of."
</p>
<p>
The pair chatted further in the video about working together, with plenty of banter and anecdotes between them.
</p>
<p>
Nakamura, for instance, recalled a party near the end of Okami's development where Kamiya said: "This team was the worst!"
</p>
<p>
Kamiya then elaborated further, explaining how Okami's development team was meant to be a "dream team" and Okami "Clover Studio's signature title". However, he described the team as a whole as "weak", due to different levels of passion from staff. Nakamura agreed and Kamiya stated he can be honest "because we're friends".
</p>
<p>
Later Kamiya said: "If [enthusiasm] had been a bit higher, Okami would have been even better. So to be honest, I'm a bit torn by the voices saying that the game is amazing."
</p>
<p>
"We could have done more," agreed Nakamura.
</p>
<p>
In another anecdote, Kamiya said Okami was originally intended to be photo-realistic, instead of the traditional Japanese art style eventually used.
</p>
<p>
"At the very beginning before you joined, we were trying to use a photo-realistic style," Kamiya told Nakamura. "But it became clear that it was impossible to create this vast natural environment on PlayStation 2."
</p>
<p>
Later in the discussion, Kamiya said he was inspired by the GameCube remake of Resident Evil Capcom was working on at the time. "When I saw that I thought the sense of realism was amazing," said Kamiya. "The level of photo-realism was very high. I thought it could be nice if we used that for something more light-hearted instead of horror."
</p>
<p>
However, once character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura created the Celestial Brush, the pieces of Okami's style and gameplay fell into place. "That Japanese touch struck a chord," said Kamiya, "so we decided to completely change the entire game."
</p>
<p>
After its initial launch in 2006, Okami was ported to the Wii with motion controls, before a HD version was released across PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC. It's become a beloved game, despite its seemingly troubled development.
</p>
<p>
Having moved on from Clover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">Kamiya left his next studio Platinum Games</a> late last year due to "issues of trust". It's unclear what he's working on next.

</p>
<p>
Nakamura, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ikumi-nakamura-unveils-first-independent-project-kemuri">unveiled her first independent project Kemuri</a> around the same time, though it's currently without a release date.

<p>There’s yet another controversy surrounding a recently released game as The First Descendent is accused of copying certain icons and even a weapon design from Destiny 2. </p>



<p>The kicker is that it’s not a clear 1-1 copy of any thing, but more of a case of making a slight change to try and make it look different.</p>







<p>The icons, which you can see courtesy of Forbes’ Paul Tassi all look a bit too similar to be merely a coincidence. On top of that, there’s also a weapon that seems to be, at the very least, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">inspired by</a> Destiny 2. It’s unclear if there are any more examples of this as only a small amount of assets have been compared. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Bungie and Nexon for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p>I’m going to be honest; I didn’t expect to enjoy Zenless Zone Zero as much as I have over the past week. I’m playing it on PC, but I thought about booting up my Xbox Series S to download the game there. Like many of you, I’m wondering whether the game is available on Xbox and, if not, then when. Is Zenless Zone Zero coming to Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-xbox">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Currently, you cannot play Zenless Zone Zero on Xbox. Unfortunately, developer HoYoverse does not officially support Xbox for any of its games. They’ve promised the community in the past that titles such as Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail would launch on Xbox Series X|S, and that day never came. Some fans continue waiting, rather impatiently, for the console launch. But it’s unlikely ever to happen.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the same is likely to occur with Zenless Zone Zero. While the studio did not state they would launch ZZZ on Xbox, it’s best not to hold up hope.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-ever-coming-to-xbox">Is Zenless Zone Zero Ever Coming to Xbox?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, there is no word on whether the gacha game is coming to Xbox Series X|S. We must assume that it’s never happening. If you’re keen on playing Zenless Zone Zero, you can do so on PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS.</p>



<p>I completely understand that, for many, a PlayStation 5 is out of the question. Even this late into its lifespan, it’s rather expensive. But there’s a chance if you have a laptop or a smartphone. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-pc-requirements-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s system requirements</a> aren’t too demanding!</p>



<hr>



<p>Most impressively, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-crosses-50-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenless Zone Zero recently crossed 50 million downloads</a>! If you’re one of those players waiting for the download to finish, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

We expect to receive a new RC, which will undergo a thorough review in August. This evaluation will determine whether we can begin the submission process and provide a solid release date, or if further issues need to be addressed.</p><p>“We understand this is disappointing, and it’s not what we had hoped for either. However, we are committed to keeping you informed throughout this development process, even if the updates aren’t always what we’d like.</p><p>“Thank you for your understanding and support.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We understand this is disappointing, and it’s not what we had hoped for either.</p></div><p>Colossal Order’s troubled city-builder sequel launched in October 2023 on PC via Steam and immediately ran into a number of issues. But Cities: Skylines 2’s problems began before its launch even arrived. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-admits-performance-issues-will-launch-the-game-anyway"><u>Colossal Order had warned players</u></a> the game would release with performance issues a week before it came out. In IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-review"><u>Cities: Skylines 2 review</u></a>, which returned a 6/10, we said: “Cities: Skylines 2 is an ambitious sequel that might have bitten off more than it can chew – be prepared to do a lot of terraforming if you don't want your metropolis to look like a nightmare.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-cities-skylines-2-players-turning-on-the-game-ceo-reveals-biggest-regret"><u>Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen later admitted</u></a> the lack of modding support was the developer’s “biggest regret.” Then, in April, Paradox was forced to offer refunds for the latest DLC, with Hallikainen and Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO of publisher Paradox, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-refunds-dlc-admits-it-rushed-it-out-and-apologizes-to-disgruntled-players">admitting the heavily criticized Beach Properties DLC was rushed out</a> in a bid to improve sentiment around the disastrous launch of Cities Skylines 2. At the time of this article's publication, more people are playing the first Cities Skylines game than its sequel on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for the console release, the plan was to release it in the spring of 2024 after missing last year's launch, but it was was delayed to October. There is no new release window. Back in April, Colossal Order and Paradox insisted that the team working on the console release operates separately from the PC development team, “so it will be progressing without splitting our focus or time.”</p><p>Missing October 2024 means Cities Skylines 2 will now launch on console over a year after it came out on PC, which was clearly not in Paradox or Colossal Order’s original plan. Meanwhile, both companies are battling a disgruntled player base by releasing updates aimed at improving the core PC version.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-publisher-hits-back-at-claims-it-should-have-better-prepared-to-provide-more-post-launch-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust."</h2></div><section><p>The publisher of Steam hit medieval city builder <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> has hit back at claims it has become the latest Early Access game to fail to provide players with enough content to keep them interested and therefore has suffered a significant drop-off.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215509660999503874/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin</a>, publisher Hooded Horse boss Tim Bender took issue with another Linkedin post from a video game developer that called Manor Lords “a pretty interesting case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access development when a game with a small team (and heavily marketed as such) hits the reality of a hungry audience.”</p><p>“As a result of the lack of updates, the concurrent users have plummeted since launch (which isn't that unusual — it's the current trend for a lot of Early Access titles that blow up these days),” the post continued.</p><p>“But given the huge number of wishlists and hype around it leading up to launch, this is something the developer and publisher should have been better prepared for, in my opinion.</p><p>“Early Access is a marathon, and when you launch you need to have your next major content expansion pretty much in the queue. The game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches with no new features or content.</p><p>“As such, I've put the game aside and don't expect to look at it again for another six months, at which point I'll probably be focused on playing something else. It's really hard to get people's attention back once you've lost it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Manor Lords Early Access Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Bender responded directly to this post by calling it “exactly the kind of distorted endless growth/burden of expectations/line must go up perspective that causes so much trouble in the games industry.”</p><p>Bender said Manor Lords sold 250,000 copies in the last month after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-sells-2-million-copies-in-just-three-weeks-exceeding-publishers-wild-hopes">selling over two million copies in its first three weeks</a>, and pointed to its ‘very positive’ Steam user review rating of 88% and its median playtime of eight hours and 48 minutes per player.</p><p>“Players are happy, the developer is happy, and we as publisher are thrilled beyond belief,” Bender said. “And yet here we are — Manor Lords is apparently a ‘case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access’ because the ‘game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches’ (one of the patch notes being called 'small' here runs over 3,000 words and over 10 single-spaced pages) leading to "concurrent users have plummeted since launch" (yes, we didn't maintain the 173,000 concurrent player peak) and the apparently dark reality that some people, after enjoying their purchase of a premium, single-player title, might decide to go on and play another game (The horror! The horror!).”</p><p>Solo developer Greg Styczeń, aka Slavic Magic, debuted Manor Lords on Steam priced $39.99 and straight into PC Game Pass in Early Access form on April 26. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-review-early-access"><u>Manor Lords Early Access review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Manor Lords is a gorgeous medieval city-builder that kept me occupied for hours building my perfect, cozy hamlets, but it definitely feels very early in its Early Access development.”</p><p>Manor Lords hit its impressive Steam peak concurrent player count two month ago, and is now sitting on 10,671 peak concurrent players in the last 24 hours. That’s not enough to make Steam’s top 100 most-played games list, but it’s not far off.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust.</p></div><p>Bender said that before Manor Lords came out, he told Styczeń to expect “all sorts of commenters talking about missed opportunities because he failed to grow as fast as they wanted, and judging the game a failure by some kind of expectation they formed.”</p><p>“I told him to ignore all that — to focus on his core vision for the game, and to keep in mind that the Early Access road is long and that he should not feel any sense of pressure from the expectations of others — for both his own health and stress levels over the coming years and for preserving the state of calm and peaceful mind that supports his creative vision.</p><p>“If this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like the below. Success should not create an ever raising bar of new growth expectations. Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust. And a release should not begin an ever-accelerating treadmill on which devs are forced to run until their mental or physical health breaks down.”</p><p>Bender’s comment drew praise from Pocketpair community chief Bucky, who called it “a fantastic response.” Pocketpair’s controversial ‘Pokémon with guns’ survival and crafting game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has itself been accused of becoming a “dead game” after peak concurrent player numbers on Steam fell dramatically following the game’s record-breaking launch earlier this year. Palworld, incidentally, is currently Steam's 14th most-played game with 110,182 peak concurrent players in the last 24 hours following the Sakurajima update in June 2024.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tim Bender, CEO of Hooded Horse, with a fantastic response to someone saying “Manor Lords is a pretty interesting case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access”.</p><p>I didn’t think Hooded Horse could get any cooler but here we are 👑 <a href="https://t.co/Rrff3UrIww" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Rrff3UrIww</a></p></div>— Bucky 🔜 BitSummit | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1810098209945166032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The “dead game” moniker is often used to describe games that have seen a fall in player numbers, but it’s also often used without context or the understanding of a developer or publisher’s metric for success. Arrowhead’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, for example, has been called a “dead game” in recent weeks because Steam peak concurrents are not what they were in the months after the game came out, but it sold well enough to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all-time.</p><p>While the live service ‘numbers go up’ burden is one that all publishers and developers who dare to enter this most crowded and competitive of markets must shoulder, when it comes to premium, single-player Early Access games made by a small team, perhaps, as Bender suggests, a new way of thinking is required.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release&nbsp;has once again been delayed, so you won't be playing this one on consoles this fall.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/console-development-status.1694383/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Paradox forums</a>, the studio says that it has "not yet met the stability and performance targets" internally set for the game's console release, which means it'll miss its previously-mooted October release window.</p>
<p>The publisher says it's making "slow but steady progress" on&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;for consoles, but that "unresolved issues" which "harm the player experience" are still hanging around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-series-release-date-delayed-greenery.jpg?itok=RoLqSJSS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-series-release-date-delayed-greenery.jpg?itok=yUpxsHCM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to arrive on consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>If all goes well, a new Release Candidate build, i.e. a build that could be suitable for release on consoles, will be submitted soon and will be reviewed in August.</p>
<p>Assuming that build is up to scratch, then the submission process will begin and a "solid release date" can be provided, but if the build doesn't pass muster, then there's a good chance the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>console release could take a while longer yet.</p>
<p>This is far from the first time&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game was originally due to arrive alongside its PC counterpart in October last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay">pushed back to spring 2024</a>&nbsp;shortly before release.</p>
<p>Following that, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">delayed further back in April</a>, and at that point, Paradox tentatively suggested that October could be the console versions' release window. However, an October release was never officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Paradox has since released a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-update-dlss-super-resolution">number of updates</a> intended to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-20-patch">address these problems</a>, although the publisher has also acknowledged that many issues remain and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">has a "mountain to climb"</a> before they're all fixed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-fsr-mod-now-available-for-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While the Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin Lighting Engine mod has been developing since 2023, it now has <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/">NVIDIA DLAA</a> and AMD FSR Super Resolution support. Over time, it has added improvements by adding volumetric fog, ground truth ambient occlusion, and many more graphical updates to make Dark Souls 2 a more visually enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Utilizing NVIDIA DLAA or AMD FSR Super Resolution significantly reduces the number of visual artifacts (specifically, aliasing) that a player might see when exploring the Kingdom of Drangleic, making it look prettier. The author admits DLAA is the superior solution for those who can enable it (owners of RTX 20/30/40 Series GPUs).</p>
<p>The mod created by Ganaboy now has many toggle-able features to create the visual dynamic you want from the game. Whether you want the screen to be brighter or dimmer or you want to turn on HDR Monitor support, the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine Mod has plenty on offer.</p>
<p>This mod is still listed as being in the Alpha stages of creation, meaning there is plenty more on the horizon regarding technical changes to ensure the best possible environments in Dark Souls 2. However, it has already added many new fixtures to the lighting systems and better shadow casting from environmental objects.</p>
<p>This update's main focus was adding DLSS and AMD FSR Super Resolution support, which is a game-changer for many players who utilize it. However, it's also added preset selections, a huge reduction in dithering and fixing God Rays throughout the game.</p>
<p>For a full list of changes that have been added in the latest update to the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine Mod, check out <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/1146?tab=description">the Nexus page</a>, which lists all of the changes listed for each mod version.</p>
<p><iframe title="Antialiasing - LightingEngine UX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P8QdyhRvbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don't wish to utilize the DLSS/DLAA feature, even a measly GTX 1050TI graphics cards run the mod. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin is widely seen as one of the most unpopular games in the franchise, but using this mod may make all the difference and allow players to have an enjoyable experience, as the world won't seem so massively outdated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Games Done Quick 2024, a week-long charity marathon featuring 24 hours of streams daily, has concluded, and it's raised a seriously impressive amount of money for charity.</p>
<p>Per a press release, SGDQ 2024 managed to raise $2.5 million for the charity organization <a href="https://www.msf.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a>, otherwise known as&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF. It's a charity SGDQ has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2016-concludes-raises-13-million">worked to benefit</a> on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2017-schedule-announced">number of occasions</a> in the past.</p>
<p>That sum contributes to a lifetime total of $51 million for Games Done Quick as an organization, all of which has gone to charities like <a href="https://ablegamers.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AbleGamers</a>, the <a href="https://researchautism.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Organization for Autism Research</a>, and the <a href="https://malala.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malala Fund</a> over the course of the charity's 14-year lifespan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/summer-games-done-quick-2024-marathon.jpeg?itok=VD9mxgv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/summer-games-done-quick-2024-marathon.jpeg?itok=XMP72Dxj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Summer Games Done Quick 2024 is over, but what a marathon it's been.</figcaption></figure><p>Highlights of this year's Summer Games Done Quick include the adorable Shiba Inu Peanut Butter, who took part in a speedrun of the SNES baseball game&nbsp;<em>Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball</em>.</p>
<p>As SGDQ says, Peanut Butter's run was accompanied by whoops, chants, and generally supportive noises from the crowd, all of whom were clearly just as in love with the lil' fella as I am.</p>
<p>Other big moments included a co-ordinated dance of the musical number "Herald of Darkness" from Remedy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-mesmerizing-murder-mystery"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, as well as a musical performance accompanying a run of the 1991 game&nbsp;<em>Sunset Riders</em>.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, was accompanied by runs of popular games like <i>Elden Ring&nbsp;</i>and its <i>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</i>DLC, <i>Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>, among many others.</p>

<p>Just because SGDQ is over, however, doesn't mean Games Done Quick will be resting on its laurels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another major event, Flame Fatales, will be held between August 18th and August 25th, and will celebrate women in speedrunning culture, revolving around an all-women lineup who you'll be able to watch kicking ass on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GDQ Twitch channel</a>.</p>
<p>That's all before Awesome Games Done Quick, another event that has historically <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation">raised impressive amounts of cash for charity</a>, returns in January. There's plenty to look forward to if you love speedrunning!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down.921369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a loosely translated report <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-zamkniete-to-koniec-tworcow-gothica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by CD-Action</a>, an employee at Piranha Bytes told them the studio shut down by the end of June.</p>



<p>This was reportedly due to investors drying up, including Embracer Group itself, though the devs apparently expected new funding. Embracer’s lack of funding for the team may not surprise players, given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-shareholder-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the extensive layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>The CD-Action report also seems to feature images of Piranha Bytes’ inactive studio after being shut down.</p>



<p>At this time, Piranha Bytes has not issued an official statement about any closure. Its most recent statement <a href="https://x.com/Piranha_Bytes/status/1749416801262297324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter/X</a> was in January 2024. </p>



<p>It did address the studio was “in a difficult situation,” though the devs remained optimistic. The team said it would “do whatever it takes to find a partner” for their project.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans will likely recognize Piranha Bytes for their work on Gothic, Gothic 2, Elex, and the Risen series. Gothic 2 Complete Classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gothic-2-complete-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on the Nintendo Switch</a> last November. </p>



<p>THQ Nordic recently mentioned plans for a Gothic 1 Remake, with more news coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/thq-nordic-showcase-announced-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an August showcase</a>. However, Steam lists Alkimia Interactive as the developer for that remake. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, two veterans from Piranha Bytes did announce they are forming Pithead Studio. Jennifer and Bjorn Pankratz stated that Pithead will “develop immersive and fantastic indie games” in the future.</p>

The end is in sight."</p><p>Fallout: London was previously due to arrive on April 23, 2024 but actual Fallout developer Bethesda announced a surprise update for Fallout 4, which the mod developer feared would impact its release.</p><p>"We've just been tweaking and testing non-stop in order to get things as stable as we can for you all in time for that release," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-creators-forced-to-delay-hotly-anticipated-mod-out-of-fear-fallout-4s-next-gen-update-will-break-it">said Team FOLON project lead Dean Carter at the time</a>.

"That has, for lack of a better term, sort of screwed us over, somewhat,” Carter said.</p><p>Fallout London is one of the most high-profile mods in development and will let players explore a post-apocalyptic version of the English capital. Players will engage with everything from “stuffy parliamentary aristocrats to a resurrection of the Knights of the Round Table to an uncompromising cult of revolutionaries." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-star-joins-cast-of-fallout-london-mod">It even stars Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion actor Neil Newbon</a>.</p><p>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-5-elder-scrolls-6-starfield">Fallout 5 will arrive after the Elder Scrolls 6</a>, which is still years away itself, but it continues to update MMO <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-50-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-cross-50-million-worldwide.921348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-50-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, the studio's latest gacha action RPG, has amassed a pretty impressive number of downloads worldwide in just a couple of days.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ZZZ_EN/status/1809527720768074217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, HoYoverse revealed this weekend that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>downloads have topped 50 million around the world "since its release". That's pretty impressive given that the game launched on July 4th.</p>
<p>The dev team says that although it's grateful for the support it's received thus far, it's also aware that "there are still lots of improvements to be made", and so it encourages players to provide feedback via the in-game Feedback menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-artwork.jpg?itok=gpoaT0Dt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-artwork.jpg?itok=qDbRZg5K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>has amassed a ton of downloads.</figcaption></figure><p>As a thank-you for the download milestone, HoYoverse has also granted a free gift of 1,600 Polychrome to&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>players.</p>
<p>If you want to receive this gift, you'll have to reach Inter-Knot Level 1 or higher before Version 1.1 is released, although since there's no official release date for that update yet, you've likely got a little while to claim your reward.</p>
<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest gacha action RPG from&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the game sees players delving into anomalies known as Hollows in order to dispatch monsters and gather resources.</p>
<p>The game uses a similar gacha system to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, although a number of the game's <a href="https://naavik.co/digest/zzz-hoyoverse-friendliest-gacha/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drop rates are higher</a>, perhaps indicating that HoYoverse wants to experiment with more forgiving and free-to-play-friendly gacha systems in future.</p>

<p>Where&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>differs from previous HoYoverse games is in its emphasis on urban fantasy and its hack-and-slash-inspired combat, which feels closer to&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>or a Platinum game than to, say,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s turn-based approach.</p>
<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do so right now</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>We've also got some guides to help you get started in the game, so make sure you check them out if you want to learn all about the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-currencies-in-zenless-zone-zero">currency</a>, how to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-modify-w-engines-in-zenless-zone-zero">modify W-Engines</a>, or how to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-promote-characters-in-zenless-zone-zero">promote your characters</a>.</p>

            <p>
I don't plan on having kids, but in the event that I change my mind, commissioning a forest Witch to grow one from a mushroom seems a lot easier than the usual human procreative process, though possibly just as abundant in screaming. I've been playing the demo for "cute-creepy" RPG and life sim Mushroom Musume, in which you - an unnamed "Recluse" - cultivate and play as a series of mushroom daughters. My current mushroom daughter is called Alia. She's a Common Turquoise Truffle. She's got a small pig acquaintance, who so far hasn't tried to devour her, and a cute fuzzy hat, which she stole from outside a church - precise impact on character development still TBC. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I have done my best to raise Alia as a gentle but self-assertive soul, the kind of public-spirited girl who lops off pieces of her own body to distribute as candies in town, and who stands up for herself when she's followed home by rogue chefs. I must confess, though, I've blundered here and there. For example, when she was a pinhead she once saw me cut somebody's throat, and I must admit, I was once <em>sorely</em> tempted to gamble her away during a dice game with a fairy (the fairy took my little finger, instead). It's perhaps thanks to these missteps that Alia is moderately damp, which I understand is a sign of good health for mushrooms in general, but may indicate, here, a certain "murkiness of the soul". Hmm.
</p>
<p>
You can find Mushroom Musume on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://mortallymoonstruckgames.itch.io/mushroom-musume">Itch</a> (the WIP Itch version is part of Itch's latest <a href="https://itch.io/b/2506/queer-games-bundle-2024-with-10-option">Queer Games Bundle</a>). I think it could be something special. Each round of the game begins with you fetching various ingredients for your filial fungus, at the behest of the aforesaid Witch. A colour, for example, which you might glean from a flower or the bottom of the river, and an heirloom, like the hairpin you gave to your previous lost child. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Then you try to do things that shape the form and persona of your budding porcini or juvenile shiitake, for better and worse. I managed to procure solid connections among the fairy folk for Alia, after deciding not to gamble her away, by refraining from murdering a fairy that snuck into her fungarium. I get the sense that each and every one of these decisions will have both nice and nasty outcomes. For example: making your daughter more outgoing and sociable might backfire if the local villagers decide that, on the whole, they'd rather eat mushrooms than talk to them.
</p>
<p>
After a few turns in the fungarium, your daughter reaches fruition and moves out, whereupon the game becomes a light-touch journalling RPG that reminds me a little of Reigns, made up of short text-based quests whose outcomes are often decided using dice. You've got ability cards, including a self-explanatory "Nope" card and a limited supply of "Soma" (aka, your own lifeforce) to spend on quests. Choices in quests affect your mushroom's personality stats and thus, presumably, the other quests you'll discover, while occasionally rewarding you with an item such as a magic handbell.  
</p>
<p>
The full game will include a "meta-progression" element whereby you raise a whole family of 'shroomans, and try to fill out your Mushroom Almanac with different species, which lends this Grimm fantasy the savour of a Balatro-style hunt for every last permutation. Your mushroom children may encounter each other in the world. For example, Alia has just been asked by the Witch to track down and kill another mycelium maiden who has gone a bit wrong. I swear, I had nothing to do with that one.
</p>
<p>
I <em>really</em> like Mushroom Musume. It's cuddly yet nasty, whimsical but rotten, eerie but enchanting and perhaps, endearing - a fairytale of the old school, in short. The premise is gloriously unwholesome, the visuals are a pleasing scrapbook of Game Boy photography, and the writing is as slight and flavourful with mounting bitter undertones as any redcap you'd find in the woods. Small flourishes abound: choosing a colour for your mushroom also decides the colour of the HUD, and there's a music player in top-right which you can turn on and off. Go on, <a href="https://mortallymoonstruckgames.itch.io/mushroom-musume">try the pre-release build</a>. It's free, but they're accepting donations.

It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://d-rpg.com/en/">website</a>, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Transformers: Galactic Trials will feature "exciting rogue-lite combat".</p>
<p>In a departure from the typical Transformer treatment – most of the dozens of Transformer games to have released over the last 20 years or so have been shooters or RPGs – this Transformer adventure will feature 10 racing circuits for Autobots and Decepticons to race against in "both vehicle and bot form".</p>
<p>Check out the action in the trailer below:</p>

<p>"Choose your loyalty by playing as iconic Autobots or Decepticons including Bumblebee, Megatron and Optimus Prime, and collect the stolen Prime Relics across the tracks to unlock new skills," Outright Games teases.</p>
<p>"Make it to the finish line by racing around 10 battle-race circuits in both vehicle and bot form, beating enemies along the way in exciting rogue-lite combat!"</p>
<p>You'll be able to choose from a roster of favourites, including Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Arcee, Wheeljack, Elita-1, Megatron, Shockwave, and Soundwave – yes, even Transformers that previously didn't get to transform into cars and trucks get a vehicular reimagining here – and take on driving and combat challenges, gather collectibles, all with "rogue-lite combat elements".</p>
<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials' "electrifying fusion of arcade racing and robot combat" is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and last-gen consoles on 11th October.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-says-activision-has-lost-its-transformers-games-on-a-hard-drive-in-its-offices-somewhere">Hasbro had to apologise for incorrectly intimating Activision lost its Transformers games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/windows-on-arm-is-not-ready-for-the-complexities-of-the-pc-gaming-landscape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via RDNE Stock Project.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relaunch of Windows on Arm has coincided with the arrival of Copilot+ PCs – devices that can execute Microsoft’s vision for the future of the Windows PC. Copilot+ PCs feature dedicated hardware that can run AI models on-device, unlocking new functionality ranging from generative AI-powered content creation to automatic image upscaling for games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, Copilot+ PCs are exclusively powered by Qualcomm’s Arm-based Snapdragon X hardware platform, with over a dozen PC makers having already launched devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This renewed investment by Microsoft and partners marks a significant milestone for Windows on Arm, which previously has seen meager support. Previous-generation processors built using the Arm architecture were unable to compete with processors on the x86 architecture from Intel and AMD, while software compatibility was not robust enough for most users’ requirements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, 2012’s ill-fated Windows RT only supported software specifically built for Arm, leaving behind support for decades of Windows software that users still depended on. While Windows 10 improved the situation with support for emulation of x86 software, this did not extend to increasingly predominant 64-bit software. Meanwhile, support for graphics-reliant applications was limited, rendering PC gaming off limits on Arm devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fast forward to 2024 and Microsoft and Qualcomm have promised Arm devices that offer greater power efficiency and performance than previous generation x86 processors from AMD and Intel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft has also developed an improved translation layer, called Prism, to improve Windows on Arm’s compatibility with x86 software. Qualcomm is so confident in Prism’s capabilities that it assured game developers at GDC 2024 that most of their games should work without additional tweaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is an ambitious claim, considering the huge library of PC games native to the x86 architecture –over 110,000 games have been published on Steam at the time of writing. For many, the PC platform is synonymous with backwards compatibility, as users invest in building up a library of games over generations of PC ownership.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gaming remains a core weakness of Windows on Arm">Gaming remains a core weakness of Windows on Arm</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the big promises Qualcomm has made to game developers, gaming remains a core weakness of Windows on Arm, as compatibility with the huge library of Windows PC games remains patchy at best.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far, just over 1,300 PC games have been independently tested for compatibility on Windows on Arm by the PC gaming community, which includes players and developers. Omdia analysis of this subset of tested games shows that barely half (55%) of games run smoothly without bugs or glitches (see Figure 1). That still leaves an large number of games that either fail to work or exhibit serious problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 1: Around half currently tested titles exhibit issues on Windows on Arm</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia, Linaro, Works on Windows on Arm</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make matters worse, popular multiplayer games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2, Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG: Battlegrounds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">are currently unplayable via Windows on Arm due to incompatibility with anti-cheat software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another critical issue holding back robust support for gaming is Qualcomm’s nascent hardware. It is still early days for Qualcomm’s Adreno GPUs in the PC space. Its drivers are in an immature state and don’t allow its graphics hardware to fully interface with the graphical demands of PC games, posing a further challenge to compatibility and performance.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PC gaming does not have an immediate future on Arm">PC gaming does not have an immediate future on Arm</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a large swathe of publishers’ PC games catalogs left in various states of incompatibility, what can be done? The PC gaming landscape isn’t just defined by the publishers and developers releasing games for the Windows operating system, but the hardware those games run on, and the numerous distribution platforms from which games are sold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, the hardware: Following the relaunch of Windows on Arm in June 2024, Arm-based Windows devices accounted for just 0.05% of Steam users according to Valve’s Steam hardware survey. Until mass adoption occurs, games publishers are not incentivized to produce native versions of their software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is unlikely to change in the short term. Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/collections/afccd056/mobile-pc-market-tracker">Mobile PC Market Tracker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> estimates that Arm-based laptops will only account for just 1% of shipments of consumer laptops shipped with the Windows operating system in 2024 (see Figure 2). However, in the longer-term, this share is expected to grow to 30% by 2029.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 2: Sales volumes of Arm-powered consumer laptops to remain low in the short term</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Mobile PC Market Tracker - July 2024</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secondly, PC games distribution: even if publishers were producing Arm-native versions of their games today, the vast majority release games via third-party distribution platforms. This creates its own set of issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, Microsoft doesn’t support local playback of Xbox PC games on Arm devices via the preinstalled Xbox app on Windows 11. Even more importantly, Steam, the world’s largest PC games distribution platform, is firmly focused on serving the existing x86 audience, including its own handheld gaming device, Steam Deck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers cannot distribute Arm versions of their software on Steam, and there is no indication that this will change. This in turn reduces publishers’ incentive to better support the currently small audience on Windows on Arm, reducing Steam’s incentive to support Arm devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The situation ultimately leaves game developers and publishers dependent on two key aspects to the Windows on Arm ecosystem that they do not control: Microsoft’s Prism translation layer and improvements made to Qualcomm’s graphics drivers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neither are quick fixes. In early 2024, Sarah Bond, President of Xbox, announced the formation of a team dedicated to forwards-compatibility of its games catalog that spans PC and console. Yet this is unlikely to be a task accomplished before 2026 at the earliest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Qualcomm’s graphics drivers are unlikely to reach a robust level of compatibility with PC games for several years. As a new entrant in this space, it will need to optimize its drivers on a per-game basis, which is time-consuming and expensive. Other hardware vendors such as Nvidia entering the Windows on Arm space could improve the situation with their mature graphics drivers, but Omdia does not anticipate this to occur until 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PC gaming on Arm is ultimately faced with the classic chicken-and-egg situation. Without a sufficiently large and proven audience of players on Arm devices, both publishers and PC games distribution platforms have little incentive to support the Arm platform, putting the onus on companies such as Microsoft and Qualcomm to improve compatibility in a bid to foster developer adoption.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the meantime, publishers and developers of PC games should focus on communicating what this means for their audience, utilizing social media channels and game store pages to inform players and potential buyers about what level of playability they should anticipate if they were using an Arm-based machine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite Microsoft’s eagerness to push the Arm architecture at the center of its new Copilot+ PC vision, the reality is that dedicated PC gaming enthusiasts will continue to favor PCs powered by the x86 architecture. While a move to Arm promises users with lighter and more efficient PC hardware, the state of PC gaming on Arm has a lot of catching up to do as the developer ecosystem remains in infancy.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/reworking-war-robots-prize-system-with-style-and-user-friendliness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Implementing a new game feature starts with planning; this is true whether it’s adding a layer of content, revising core mechanics, reworking the interface, or making quality-of-life changes. Any successful planning begins with clear goals. And our goal was ambitious: completely overhauling the event prize system in War Robots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello! I'm Nikolay Berezkin, Senior Game Designer at War Robots, and I'm joined by Anton Trofimov, Lead 2D Artist at Pixonic (MY.GAMES). Today, we're excited to share with you the story of how Data Pads, our new content system in War Robots, came to be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why revamp the prize system?">Why revamp the prize system?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data Pads were born out of a desire to revolutionize our outdated event prize system, which had remained largely unchanged for years. We wanted to transform the way players experience event prizes, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further, we wanted to expand the range of offers during events so that every player could receive something valuable and reduce production costs and the frequency of visual updates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was also important for us to introduce a narrative element to the prize-receiving process, hinting at why a small "container" could hold massive robots and spaceships. This was no easy feat, given the game's 10-year history and the numerous legacy systems in place.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A change of appearance">A change of appearance</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first step of our overhaul was ditching the outdated visuals for something modern, universal, and easy to read. The form factor decision was a no-brainer: the name "Data Pads" itself suggested a card-like design – a futuristic storage medium, like a tablet from the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, we envisioned each Data Pad displaying a 3D picture or render of the main prize. However, we considered this idea again and ultimately opted to abandon renders due to their high development costs and limited benefits. Despite this change, players can still easily identify which Data Pads contain the most valuable and desirable rewards, thanks to our clever design concept and engaging visual effects when opening the pads. Each data pad has two types of color differentiation: a silver or golden border indicating the quality of the data pad, and the color of the data pad itself – blue, purple, or red – which corresponds to the content of the prize pack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our other key objectives was to break free from the cycle of updating visuals for every event. We wanted players to become familiar with the consistent Data Pad design and eliminate any confusion with other elements. To achieve this, we introduced "card backs", which are event-specific updates that add a fresh touch to the Data Pads without altering their core design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first event to feature Data Pads was themed around Beast Knights. As a fitting touch, we chose animal crests as card backs: a wolf, lion, and bear. By examining the Data Pads, players could infer, based on their crests, the rewards they might expect from both the regular and premium (gold) versions.</span></p><p>Examples of ordinary Data Pads and golden Data Pads. The latter aren’t available for direct purchase and can only be obtained through in-game activities, like leaderboard competitions</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Streamlining how users open the Data Pad">Streamlining how users open the Data Pad</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our next mini-task was to facilitate seamless collaboration between departments in order to develop a new feature for opening Data Pads. This was a rare opportunity for us to work on a large feature that heavily relies on visual elements. However, the game's age presented certain constraints on client development and art, which we had to carefully consider.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To overcome these hurdles, we had to revamp the entire prize-opening workflow. We broke down the feature into several key stages: event HUD, cinematic, prize reveal, and returning to the HUD. Each stage required the expertise of different specialists. Meanwhile, the producer and game designer oversaw the overall vision of the feature, ensuring that the entire team was aligned throughout the development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We started with a small UI prototype that simulated navigating the main screens. At the same time, we started working on a cinematic – a short video that would play in the game engine when a Data Pad is opened.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, we needed to clarify a couple of crucial aspects. We had a rough idea about the appearance of the Data Pads, but how would we present them to the player? During one meeting, an idea cropped up: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"Let's have it fall from the sky, with a teleport beam and FX, then boom, the player gets a reward!"</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> And the final version as implemented isn't far from this concept. We knew the feature needed a build-up to the prize, filling the player with anticipation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of time was spent brainstorming how the player would receive the reward, where it would appear, and how it would materialize. After numerous experiments, the "heavenly wham" concept evolved into a camera flying through a corridor into a room, where the reward would suddenly appear in a flash of light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second crucial question: what exactly is a Data Pad? These are carriers of information, but in the game, it can actually contain a massive robot and a gun. We were concerned about the realism of this device and how to avoid violating the game's logical world. To address this, we came up with a new concept: Data Pads contain encrypted information, like coordinates pointing to the location of prizes won by the player, including in-game currencies, robots, and other content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The player-commander uses a decoder key located on their ship to crack the code, and the coordinates are instantly displayed on their screen. This idea became the foundation for our development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To showcase the connection between the Data Pad card and the prize, we introduced the spotlight pedestal concept. The Data Pad is first revealed and "decrypted" on the pedestal, and then, at the end of the cinematic, the prize itself materializes on a similar pedestal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the final version, this pedestal concept doesn't always shine through as clearly as we'd have liked; the pedestal's visibility varies across different screens, and we didn't want to increase the card's height, fearing it would disrupt the composition. At present, we're exploring ways to fine-tune the design to make it even more stunning.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A UI overhaul">A UI overhaul</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also focused on making sure the player has a clear understanding of the prizes they can expect. Previously, the loot box displayed a dull, outdated list of prizes – this is a far cry from user-friendliness. Functionally, it was a lengthy carousel with cards, where players had to scroll through to see possible rewards, with prizes seemingly placed haphazardly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, we've updated the UI and breathed new life into it – players can better see the value of the prizes, can categorize them more easily and choose something of interest to them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've also thoroughly overhauled the mechanics of the system. The old system consisted of a static screen featuring a selection of chests, which players could open by spending a set number of event coins, and they had the option to open either one or ten chests at once with a simple tap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through experimentation, we settled on a 3-chest, 3-currency system. Each chest and currency feature distinct visuals, creating a sense of progression, and contain different rewards to reinforce this. The coins used to open chests were also utilized in various monetization features, such as in-game quests, offers, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, the original interface fell short in one crucial aspect: it didn't provide players with any information about the potential rewards they could earn with their coins. To get that info, players had to waste time navigating to a separate screen, searching for the chest that corresponded to their coins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The old system was plagued by issues that made it difficult for players to understand what was going on: coins and chests were often confusingly similar or vastly different, leading to player frustration and confusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our rework addressed these problems head-on. First of all, we now offer Data Pads directly, rather than the keys to unlock them. This eliminates the need for players to keep track of unnecessary information and clears up confusion about which coin corresponds to which chest. This change also optimized our production pipelines, allowing our art team to focus on a single entity without having to create intermediate links in the form of event currencies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second, each Data Pad now features a button that opens an information window, displaying the potential prizes within. This simplifies the purchasing process because players can now easily find out which Data Pad contains a more desirable reward. This button is conveniently available at all points where Data Pads can be obtained, including battle passes, leaderboards, and offers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Third, the event interface has undergone a significant overhaul. It no longer displays Data Pads that are inaccessible to the player. Unlike the static presence of three chests on the screen, Data Pads may be absent, and if a player only has one type of Data Pad, they can only interact with that one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">***</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is far from the end of our journey. With all of our work, we continue to push further, refine our features, and Data Pads are no exception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not everything went smoothly, but we've learned from our experiences. As an example of that last point, the idea of connecting screens through pedestals didn't quite work out as planned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also needed to improve the readability of the value between the first Data Pads, which was accomplished by the next event. Additionally, we refined the polishing effects, which had a significant impact on players' perceptions of Data Pad rarity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most importantly, the feature resonated with players and achieved its primary goal of reversing the trend of fading interest in events, creating a truly explosive "wow" effect. The metrics we collected confirmed the importance of offering a wide range of choices in such features. To bring things to a close, I'd like to commend the entire team for their outstanding work with Data Pads!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
