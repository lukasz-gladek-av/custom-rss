The table comes with all kinds of whimsical bells and whistles and an all-star voice cast, and it can be yours starting at $7,000. Or you could pay nearly double that for the limited edition version.</p><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant’s Eye</em> takes players into the Forgotten Realms to face off against owlbears, gelatinous cubes, a red dragon, and Xanathar the beholder, all with just a pair of flippers and a few steel balls. Trap doors unlock new dungeons and dice rolls will dictate how the adventure unfolds. I don’t have a spare down payment for a new car lying around, but I do have a basement just waiting to be renovated where this would fit perfectly. </p><p>  “Battle Rath the Relentless, the red dragon, the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball, [who] intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion and features omnidirectional impact sensing technology,” writes Stern in a press release. “Voiced by the iconic Michael Dorn, players will attempt to defeat Rath the Relentless with pinballs and by hitting the 3-bank target, steal its treasure. When Rath the Relentless breathes his magnificent fire, multiple pinballs shoot from its mouth but be prepared. Players can activate a metal shield between the flippers to not only defend against attacks but also assist with playfield shots.”</p><p>I’m by no means a pinball connoisseur, but that all sounds rad. Critical Role fans are also in for a treat since Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray are also part of the <em>D&amp;D </em>pinball machine’s voice cast, along with Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, and Gerard Way. And the table even incorporates the Stern Insider app to save progress. It’s effectively a <em>D&amp;D</em> pinball roguelike. In fact, that would be a great idea for an actual video game too. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-review/1900-6137018/" data-ref-id="1900-6137018">Guitar Hero</a> debuted in November 2005, but the franchise has been in a lull for a long time. The last game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-live-review/1900-6416284/" data-ref-id="1900-6416284">Guitar Hero Live</a>, arrived in 2015 and there hasn't been any concrete word about a new title since. However, the Guitar Hero fandom lives on in 2025, and there's a new controller coming to the Wii later this month.</p><p>Hyperkin has announced that an updated version of the company's Wii Guitar is up for preorder ahead of its release date, January 8. It's called the Hyper Strummer, and it includes support for Wii's Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles, with the exception of the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rock-band-review/1900-6184123/" data-ref-id="1900-6184123">Rock Band</a> game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">New Year, New Wii... Guitars. Introducing the HYPER STRUMMER! An updated model of our previous Wii Guitar, we have been working hard and wanted to give you a little surprise of what is to come this year! The HyperStrummer is set to pre orders start NOW! <a href="https://t.co/e82FJN6bCk" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/e82FJN6bCk</a></p>  — Hyperkin (@Hyperkin) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At $77, the Hyper Strummer is somewhat pricey. But it was made to resemble the classic Guitar Hero controllers. It's also powered by the Wii remote, so players won't need to pickup any batteries for this controller. It's unclear how many Guitar Hero or Rock Band players are still using the Wii in 2025, but presumably Hyperkin took that into account before committing to this project. </p><p>Because Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard, the company now controls the fate of any future Guitar Hero games. Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-says-he-passed-on-acquiring-so-many-games-including-destiny-and-guitar-hero/1100-6526241/" data-ref-id="1100-6526241">that he passed on Guitar Hero</a> before it became a breakout hit. In 2022, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick noted that he and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-guitar-hero-come-back-under-microsoft-kotick-says-the-xbox-company-has-resources-to-do-it/1100-6499764/" data-ref-id="1100-6499764">Spencer had discussions about bringing Guitar Hero back</a>, but we haven't heard anything new about those talks since then. Guitar Hero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2024-video-game-hall-of-fame-finalists-include-metroid-resident-evil-and-guitar-hero/1100-6521847/" data-ref-id="1100-6521847">was also one of the finalists</a> to be added to 2024's class at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-in-the-video-game-hall-of-fame/2900-5170/" data-ref-id="2900-5170">Strong Museum's Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. However, the game wasn't among the titles selected for that year.</p>

                <p>The Warrior is a classic ARPG class that features some ground-shattering skills in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2.</a> However, in the beginning stages of early access, many players are already calling for buffs to the Warrior due to the sluggishness of its abilities and weaker attacks in the endgame. While the Warrior very well may get buffed in the future, its currently designed for more advanced Path of Exile players.</p><p>Of course, if you follow the right build guide, it won't matter how much time you have played in the series. Below, you'll find the only viable Warrior build in the current state of Path of Exile 2.</p><h2>Warrior Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As you might expect, the Warrior is the definition of a melee class in Path of Exile 2. The class' main damage dealers are two-handed weapons like mauls and maces, which each come with skills of their own. However, players are allowed to switch things up and make use of a one-handed weapon along with a shield if they're looking to play more defensively. Shields also has its own defensive skill that allows you to block attacks, but you won't deal as much damage with this kind of build.</p><p>Fortunately, Path of Exile 2 allows you to swap freely between two different builds. So, you can have a two-handed weapon on one build and a one-handed weapon/shield on another build. This allows you to easily change up your playstyle depending on whether offensive or defensive strategies are required for a certain fight. You can also dual-wield one-handed weapons and this does come into play with certain skills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247"></a><figcaption>A club and shield will be your starting weapons as a Warrior</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png"></figure><p>Generally, though, the best build for a Warrior in Path of Exile 2 relies on dealing damage with two-handed weapons, as it's very easy to get overwhelmed by mobs or bosses if you try to get too defensive.</p><p>As a Warrior, you'll want to put as many attribute points as possible into Strength. The other two attributes, Dexterity and Intelligence, won't come into play too much unless you want to be a more nimble Warrior. In that case, putting some points into Dexterity could be a good idea for certain gear.</p><h2>Best Warrior Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>With the overview of the Warrior out of the way, it's time to talk skills. The Warrior has access to a wide variety of powerful attacks, but the main downfall of a lot of them is their overall slowness. You'll find yourself mashing buttons trying to get attacks off quicker, but the Warrior is simply a sluggish class that takes plenty of patience.</p><p>For the most part, the Warrior relies on AoE damage to hurt and kill enemies. You'll want to stay as close as possible to enemies to inflict the most damage possible, but this also means you'll be taking more damage in return. This is where swapping back between different weapons and your shield can come into play. Using an AoE attack and then changing to a shield to survive enemies that weren't killed and repeating the process is an effective gameplay loop you'll find yourself using.</p><p>Below, you can find the skills we recommend for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Mace Strike</li><li>Earthquake</li><li>Boneshatter</li><li>Shockwave Totem</li><li>Infernal Cry</li><li>Leap Slam</li><li>Sunder</li><li>Ancestral Warrior Totem</li><li>Hammer of the Gods</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248"></a><figcaption>All skills for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png"></figure><p>The best Warrior build really can't come to fruition until you complete Act 3 on standard difficulty in Path of Exile 2. The build's best skills don't come until after you get into the acts again on Cruel difficulty. Skills like Sunder, Ancestral Warrior Totem, and Hammer of the Gods are quite effective for mobs and bosses but are unlocked late.</p><p>As such, using skills like Earthquake, Boneshatter, Shockwave Tote, and Infernal Cry is going to be your best bet for the early game in Acts 1-3. The build really picks up when you unlock Leap Slam, which pairs perfectly with Bone Shatter and a two-handed weapon. You can use these two skills in concert to deal massive damage and also avoid enemy attacks in the process. Also, using Infernal Cry before performing a combo will only boost the damage you deal, so make sure you're spamming that as much as possible.</p><p>In the early game, Mace Strike is an effective way to clear mobs, but it slowly gets out-paced by other skills. Earthquake, Boneshatter, and Shockwave Totem are decent skills that deal AoE damage, but they take a while to get off.</p><h2>Best Warrior Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>Moving on with your build, your next task is to equip your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill Gems</a> with the right Support Gems as well as equip some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> to grant you persistent buffs during combat.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Martial Tempo (all skills, but Leap Slam specifically)</li><li>Momentum (Leap Slam)</li><li>Holy Descent (Leap Slam)</li><li>Magnified Effect (all skills, but Earthquake/Shockwave Totem specifically)</li><li>Impact Shockwave (Boneshatter)</li><li>Brutality</li><li>Fist of War (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Primal Armament (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Supercritical (Sunder)</li><li>Concentrated Effect (Sunder)</li><li>Premeditation (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Raging Cry (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Rage</li><li>Deep Cuts (Mace Strike)</li><li>Heft (Mace Strike/Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Font of Rage (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li><li>Splinter (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Overwhelming Presence</li><li>Scavenged Plating</li></ul><h2>Best Warrior Passive Skills</h2><p>As you level up with the Warrior, you'll gain one Passive Point to allocate to the Passive Ability Skill Tree. The Warrior's skill tree is fairly straightforward, as you want to mainly put points toward Strength, physical damage, and AoE damage.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Warrior:</p><ul><li>Brutal</li><li>Sturdy Metal</li><li>Smash</li><li>Unstoppable Barrier</li><li>Blade Catcher</li><li>Beef</li><li>Sudden Infuriation</li><li>Lasting Trauma</li><li>Skullcrusher</li><li>Split the Earth</li><li>Resolute Technique</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249"></a><figcaption>The Warrior's Passive Ability Skill Tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png"></figure><p>You'll also want to put points into different Strength attribute nodes wherever you can, as the Warrior can never have too much of it.</p><h2>Best Warrior Ascendancy in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the Warrior's Ascendancy, which you can choose after slogging through the leveling process with the class. There are two choices for the Warrior's Ascendancy, which are: The Titan and Warbringer.</p><p>The key difference between the two Ascendancies is what you want to prioritize. The Titan is more about dealing damage while the Warbringer has some more defensive-minded abilities that help you survive against large mobs and bosses. With the current state of the Warrior being a little weaker, we recommend the Warbringer. You can take advantage of abilities like the Jade Heritage skill to absorb damage without it affecting your HP, making boss fights much more bearable.</p><p>However, in the future, the Titan Ascendancy will likely be the stronger pick after some buffs to the Warrior as a whole.</p>

			<p>We've brought in the new year, and we are now in 2025, where there are plenty of big-name titles that are set to release. There have already been a number of predictions, especially when it comes to the state of the video game industry, which has had a very volatile couple of years. Last year saw a devastating number of layoffs. However, according to Jason Schreier, things will be looking up in 2025 for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>2024 ended with a lot of announcements for 2025 and, of course, the long-awaited Game Awards. The event saw many new game announcements, including the surprise announcement of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. However, there have also been a ton of rumors about upcoming titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, a game that is eagerly awaited by fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-03/video-game-predictions-for-2025-from-grand-theft-auto-vi-to-silksong?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNTkyNzI4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzM2NTMyMDgyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUElZMDdUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.G8QUT2LbVY_4QAMSSgnnHB1OqBGcv939rI9lcczGAJU&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schreier predicts</a> that there will be major changes coming for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">Ubisoft</a>. Out of all of the predictions, this one would be the least surprising. Ubisoft has had an incredibly tumultuous couple of years, with both Star Wars Outlaws and XDefiant not performing how the company wanted. It is so much so that the servers for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">XDefiant are being shut down later this year</a>, with no new players being able to try out the game before it disappears.</p>
<p>According to the post by Schreier, Grand Theft Auto VI isn't going to perform as well as Rockstar Games may think. It is one of the most anticipated games of this year, as it's been a long time in the making, with many leaks coming out. However, being so highly anticipated puts a lot of pressure on Rockstar Games to perform, which could lead to negative consequences for the upcoming title.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been a long time coming, and as the months and years pass, it feels as if we hear even less about the game. So much so that people are beginning to wonder if it even exists at all. This game was first announced in 2019 after initially being slated to be a DLC. However, the scope increased massively and has now become a full title in development by Team Cherry. The last we heard was from <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Keighley in 2024</a> before Gamescom that there would be no announcements, as "Team Cherry is still cooking." The game was initially meant to be released in 2023, but they've said they are still developing it. Whether we'll actually see it released this year remains to be seen.</p>
<p>People are also hoping for a Half-Life announcement, as Half-Life: Alyx was released in 2020 but was only available to those who have VR. Last year saw a lot of rumors about Half-Life, and the possibility of the game making a resurgence with a new addition to the franchise. There is potential, but there's no certainty behind this rumor.</p>
<p>What are your video game predictions for 2025?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/marvel-rivals-lifts-100-year-cheating-bans-on-mac-and-steam-deck-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>With Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">impressive work on the Proton tool for Linux</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Mac's Game Porting Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/new-directx-12-to-metal-translation-could-bring-a-world-of-windows-games-to-macos/">CrossOver</a> options, few games are truly "Windows only" these days. The exceptions are those with aggressive, Windows-based anti-cheating tools baked in, something that hit back hard against players eager to dive into a new superhero shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, an <em>Overwatch</em>-ish free-to-play hero shooter released in early December 2024, has all the typical big online game elements: an in-game shop with skins and customizations, battle passes, and anti-cheating tech. While Proton, which powers the Linux-based Steam Deck's ability to play just about any Windows game, has come very far in a few years' time, its biggest blind spots are these kinds of online-only games, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/">like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">Apex Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the like. The same goes for Mac players, who, if they can work past DirectX 12, can often get a Windows game working in CrossOver or Parallels, minus any anti-cheat tools.</p>
<p>Is there harm in trying? For a while, there was 100 years' worth. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1hrsitf/marvel_rivals_banning_mac_os_users/">detailed in the r/macgaming subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">at r/SteamDeck</a>, many players who successfully got <em>Marvel Rivals</em> working would receive a "Penalty Issued" notice, with a violation "detected" and bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hs2s6z/ban_until_2124_for_cheating_but_i_didnt_cheat/">issued until 2124</a>. Should such a ban stand, players risked entirely missing the much-prophesied Year of the Linux Desktop or Mainstream Mac Gaming, almost certain to happen at some point in that span.</p>

                <p>It's a big day for Call of Duty, as the new Squid Game collaboration launches today, January 3, alongside a significant update across Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision has now posted the full patch notes, revealing all the significant changes and updates--and there are many.</p><p>Across Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone, all mantle speeds have been increased, while doors can now be opened and close while sprinting. Additionally, the Cleaver melee weapon is now available to unlock through the new Squid Game event reward in the new event pass, which costs 1,100 COD Points for the premium track.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja0LKjA4lxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ja0LKjA4lxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Activision warned that some players might see their Operator selections and customizations reset with the new update. Activision didn't say why this is occurring or what players can do about it beyond just starting over.</p><p>There are a bunch of new Squid Game-themed multiplayer modes available now in Black Ops 6, including Red Light, Green Light and one called Roulette Handgun. This mode allows players to obtain a powerful handgun that comes with the risk of killing the player, as each shot has a chance to blow up the weapon and the player.</p><p>There are no weapon-balance adjustments, but Black Ops 6's Scorestreaks are getting new tuning updates. This includes a reduction in max damage for the RC-XD and Care Packages now containing fewer Scout Pulses. The Sentry Turret, meanwhile, sees increases to its HP and fire rate, while the Watchdog Helo's damage is increased as well.</p><p>For Zombies, there is a new Squid Game mode called Dead Light, Green Light where players try to rack up zombie kills during the Green Light phase. When Red Light is called, any player who moves has essence drained from them. And when the Dead Light phase kicks in, players face off against increasingly difficult waves of zombies.</p><p>In Warzone, the January 3 patch fixes a number of bugs, including an error that would prevent the exfil animation to play during Ranked Play. The update also fixes an issue that incorrectly stopped players from using an Advanced UAV in some scenarios, and another issue pertaining to money drops.</p><p>The January 3 patch also brings a Squid Game mode to Warzone's Urzikstan map. This comes in the form of a rotating series of challenges, with teams eliminated each round until only one remains. Additionally, Red Light, Green Light can be triggered between rounds.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Activision.</a></p><p>As for Squid Game, the second season of the popular Netflix series is out now. Season 3 is set for release later this year.</p><h2>Friday, January 3, 2025</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Movement</h4><ul><li>Increased all mantle speeds.</li><li>Doors can now be opened and closed while sprinting.</li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>New Cleaver Melee weapon now available via Event rewards.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s view could become obstructed with specific weapons when using the Dark Practitioner Tracer Pack Bundle without an optic.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens would not be visible on the Saug Mecha-Drake Mastercraft Blueprint.</li><li>Hawker Hybrid optic now correctly works with the Ginger Dread Blueprint.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Improved AAR flow.  <ul><li>Added a Dismiss button to exit at any point and a timer.</li><li>Added a Summary at the end.</li></ul></li><li>Improved readability when searching for a match.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens could not be previewed.</li></ul><p>NOTE: Some players may see their Operator selections and Operator customizations reset after this update.</p><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Red Light, Green Light (NEW)</b><ul><li>Young-hee is watching, so don’t misstep at the wrong time. Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long.</li><li>In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Pentathlon (NEW)</b><ul><li>Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme! Play Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint along with two new mode variants: Piggy Bank Team Deathmatch and Roulette.  <ul><li>In Piggy Bank TDM, every elimination adds score to the Mega Piggy Bank; fight for possession of the huge payout when it drops part way through the match.</li><li>In Roulette, one-shot eliminations via the Roulette Handgun award double the points, though with each fired shot there’s a chance it’ll blow up in your hands!</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Squid Game Moshpit (NEW)</b><ul><li>Fire up the Squid Game Moshpit including Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint with a twist as players gain access to three important Squid Game-themed features:  <ul><li>Red Light, Green Light Scorestreak: Is the fight getting too hectic for you? Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy players to stop moving or risk elimination.</li><li>Piggy Bank: Eliminated players have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within.</li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch? Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Prop Hunt</b><ul><li>Improved spatial audio on Prop whistles.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Prop UI could remain present when switching rounds to the Hunter team.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Props could block doors from opening when locked in place.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Wildcards</h4><ul><li><b>High Roller (NEW)</b><ul><li>Allows players to equip up to four Scorestreaks.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Scorestreaks</h4><ul><li><b>RC-XD</b><ul><li>Slightly reduced the RC-XD’s max damage.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Archangel Launcher</b><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue where the next bullet fired from a weapon after using the Archangel Launcher could be an Archangel rocket.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Care Package</b><ul><li>Care Packages will now contain the Scout Pulse Scorestreak less frequently.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>LDBR</b><ul><li>Decreased the damage the LDBR does to its owner.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 950 to 800.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sentry Turret</b><ul><li>Increased Sentry Turret fire rate.</li><li>Increased Sentry Turret HP.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1000 to 950.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Hellstorm</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1050 to 1000.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Watchdog Helo</b><ul><li>Slightly increased the Watchdog Helo’s damage.</li><li>Increased Watchdog Helo accuracy when it acquires a new target.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1100 to 1050.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Strategic Bomber</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1300 to 1100.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>A.G.R.

This article will list our picks for the best sports and racing games that were released this year so you know where to spend your money and efforts for the best experience.</p>
<p>Here are the best sports and racing games of 2024. Strap in, because there are some great ones to check out.</p>

<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>WWE 2K24 is a great game to get stuck into if you're looking to participate in some competition against friends and family. Alternatively, there's the career mode, where you work your way up the rankings and become an iconic wrestler of WWE. Compared to previous years, they've made some major improvements and made the game more immersive, allowing for a more realistic experience compared to some of the previous WWE games. Below is an excerpt from Nathan Birch's review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24, this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>

<h2>EA Sports FC 25</h2>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 was one of the most popular sports games to be released this year, according to information from both Circana and Newzoo. Ultimately, it's not too surprising. EA Sports FC is the replacement for the FIFA games and remains just as popular even without the official FIFA license. For a significant amount of time this year, it was one of the top games in the charts. It's the perfect game to be a sweaty gamer in. There were some <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major improvements to the game</a>, such as the introduction of the 5v5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rush mode</a> as well as the addition of being able to play using the women's teams the same way you would utilize the men's teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>F1 24</h2>
<p>Released in May, this is the perfect game for any petrolheads or fans of racing games. Compared to previous games in the franchise, F1 24 is very beginner-friendly and more accessible compared to previous iterations. There is plenty of variety, with 20 drivers and 10 teams to explore, not to mention the ability to <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-career-mode-finally-lets-you-play-as-a-current-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play in the career mode</a> as one of the current superstars. The handling model <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-features-dynamic-handling-the-series-most-comprehensive-physics-update-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a physics update</a>, too. Whether you decide to play and compete online against others or you play solely by yourself against AI in the Driver Career mode, there is a lot of replayability and promise from F1 24.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>EA Sports College Football 25</h2>
<p>One of the other major successful sports games of the year is EA Sports College Football 25. This game took off and was one of the best-sellers on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. Fans who liked the College Football franchise had to wait a whopping 11 years between NCAA Football 14 and EA Sports College Football 25. While the actual football games were a massive part of the game, there were a lot of other features that made it enjoyable, including scheduling visits to colleges, getting to know the recruits, and playing with teams that are less significant than NFL teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MotoGP 24</h2>
<p>Compared to previous iterations in the MotoGP franchise, this game didn't get a lot of new content or updates that made the game stand out from the crowd. That being said, it's a stunning game and offers the exhilarating experience that fans of this racing franchise are familiar with. While there wasn't much added in particular regarding racing, there were some pretty groundbreaking changes. This includes new transfer markets and being able to adapt the difficulty to your liking.</p>

It’s the notion that there’s only one core route through a game, a pre-determined path down which all players must tread, where we do not have the freedom to pick our own directions. As such, looking back from our current era in which open-world games dominate the AAA landscape, this can give the appearance of a design that removes or restricts player agency to a deletory result.</p><p>And to be incredibly clear, some corridors did just that. While first-person games were born in level-based mazes (<em>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, etc), there did come a wake of games that were almost literal corridors, so ridiculously restrictive that it felt like being dragged down their inevitable tunnel by your nostrils, shoulders scraping the claustrophobic walls all the way. To name names, the very worst of these were the <em>Call of Duty</em> campaigns from <em>Black Ops</em> onward—games that killed you if you dared to walk left or right, rather than straight on, and pushed you to the back to watch the NPCs play the game for you.</p><p>But I would argue that almost no one who played <em>BioShock</em> in 2007 reacted by saying, “Damn, that was just a corridor.” Because it was a game that, despite having only one core pathway, allowed players to feel an enormous sense of freedom. You chose <em>huge</em> amounts in <em>BioShock</em>, from how you actually played (run-and-gun shooter, device-based trapping and stealth, immersive sim), to how you responded to the nature of the world around you, not least in how you treated the Little Sisters. People celebrated the game for the amazing amount of freedom it offered within such a tightly scripted narrative, and all of that is to ignore that the game being a prescribed corridor was <em>the <strong>entire point</strong></em>.</p><p>Sorry to spoil an 18-year-old game, but the fact that you had no choice but to follow the instructions you were given was the massive third-act reveal. That the game was set in an inescapable corridor is so much of why <em>BioShock</em> was brilliant, because if it had let players visit any point in the underwater city of Rapture whenever they wanted, everything else about it would have fallen apart.</p><p><em>BioShock</em>’s drama so often depends on you being exactly where the game designer wants you to be, at exactly the moment they want you there, and that kind of precise narrative choreography is the result of a corridor. By rejecting such game design as a failure, we’re losing this kind of experience, and I really believe it’s something we should instead be fighting to save.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course corridors are, and should be, only a part of games. I’m not silly, I love a fantastic open-world game, and of course have been playing RPGs since the 1980s that offer vast amounts of player freedom when approaching their worlds. I’m not for a moment arguing for anything more than a desire to preserve the corridor as an option among so much else, and therefore not to disparage it as if a failure of the past. Because damn, it brought so much success.</p><p>I don’t think I’m necessarily being that huge of a maverick here. In fact, if you look at any number of “all time best games” lists, and adjust for recency bias, there are certain names that come up again and again: <em>Half-Life 2</em>, <em>Deus Ex</em>, <em>Quake 2</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>. They share space on those lists with games that do quite the opposite, the litany of wonderful RPGs that often eschew corridors entirely, but those games with straight paths undeniably dominate.

But what they cannot do as well is puppeteer the player, creating deliberate, narrative moments on a deliberate, narrative path. They cannot offer something more akin to the scenes of a movie, where the impact of event B is so much more meaningful because it came directly as a response to the action of event A, and the consequence of this drives the emotional resonance of event C.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I remember, in the early 00s, at the beginning of the rejection of corridor gaming as a design choice, responding with the same argument that springs to mind now: “Do you reject having to read the pages of a book in order? Is the book a failure if page 37 comes after page 36 every time?” To which the immediate counter is, “Games aren’t books, that’s why we call them something else,” and sure, but my point is: games <em>can</em> aim to be like books in some of the best ways. Because, when your game is set in a corridor, when the scenes are as inevitable as the pages of the book, it’s how we interact with them that defines them. It places the emphasis on our own personal interpretation of what we’re offered, and rather than being a sandbox in which we can play god, we’re instead inside a story which we have the means to uniquely experience.</p><p>(In fact, this is the basis for why I’ve argued that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is not a failure to recognize player agency</a></span>, but instead a scripted moment understood uniquely based on your personal experiences accrued across all three games.)</p><p>Agency can be wonderful, but it is often at a cost—the cost of a curated, directed, deliberate narrative experience. And yes, it wouldn’t be a good thing if all games were that, but it’s no better to look down upon it as an anachronistic shortcoming of game design. <em>BioShock</em> only worked <em>because</em> it was a corridor, and indeed was a thesis <em>on the corridor</em>, making it all the more odd of a game to throw under the bus of history. There’s value in experiencing a curated, pre-determined tale, boosted by our unique approaches born of how we turn those pages. I don’t want it to be lost, in the name of boasting “greater player agency.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Counter-Strike 2 came out, it fully replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and introduced a wave of new improvements and changes. While not all the changes have been widely approved by the game’s huge playerbase, CS2 remains the most popular game played on Steam, with no signs of slowing down soon.</p>



<p>But when exactly did the Counter-Strike 2 era begin?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-counter-strike-2-come-out">When Did Counter-Strike 2 Come Out?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 officially came out on September 27, 2023, though the game was playable for some players earlier than that.</p>



<p>CS2 was originally announced back on March 22, 2023, via <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">a series of posts from Val</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">v</a><a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">e</a> highlighting some of the new changes. These changes included the new volumetric and reactive smokes, sub-tick servers, and overhauled or visually updated maps. The game itself also came over to the Source 2 engine.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fresh off the new game announcement, Valve opened a limited test that would offer select players a chance to try out CS2. Less than two months later, in May, Counter-Strike would hit its all-time player peak at 1.8 million players. This can be attributed to the rise in players trying to get CS2 limited test access as well as the release of the Major pass for the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>Finally, on September 27, 2023, CS:GO was officially taken over by Counter-Strike 2. Response to the release was mixed, as gameplay modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone didn’t come over to CS2. Arms Race eventually was released in CS2 in the next year. Valve continues to roll out new updates addressing bugs and major issues while introducing new content.</p>



<p>How do you feel about CS2 since it came out? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

<p>It took just two days before the first layoffs of 2025 took place in the gaming industry. Netmarble F&amp;C is laying off about 20 people — roughly 25% — at the company.</p>



<p>The news was first reported by Korean news outlet <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250102076600017?section=industry/game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YNA</a>.</p>



<p>Netmarble F&amp;C is a subsidiary of the mobile games company Netmarble. The studio is currently working on its new game Demis Reborn, which is scheduled to release sometime in 2025. According to YNA, the game’s “art style and overall atmosphere were significantly revised” in order to better suite adult taste.</p>







<p>It’s also reported that the game’s release date is “likely” to be altered a bit due to the staffing changes.</p>



<p>The last two years have been the worst the games industry has seen when it comes to layoffs. After over 10,000 layoffs in 2023, 2024 <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saw an estimated 16,000+</a> jobs lost. </p>



<p>Do you think 2025 will be better or worse for layoffs in gaming? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

Sega has been notoriously chill with fans of the Blue Blur using its characters in their own projects, and there are even a handful of community-driven remakes of old games that could use a modern touch-up. The one we’re talking about today is <em>Sonic Galactic</em>, a sidescroller evocative of the series’ 16-bit roots, but made to look like the series might have on the Sega Saturn. The developers over at Starteam have released a new demo, so if you want a look into an alternate universe where Sonic Team got to make a classic <em>Sonic </em>game for the Sega Saturn, you can do that right now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196572" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Starteam <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sonicgalactic.github.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sonicgalactic.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">describes <em>Sonic Galactic</em></a></span> as “a ‘what-if’ scenario: an imagining of what Sonic Team could have potentially produced” for the Sega Saturn if the system had been more successful and Sega had produced a mainline <em>Sonic </em>game for it. However, the team also notes that it didn’t limit itself to the Saturn’s technical specifications, instead using the hardware and games that were created during the early-‘90s era as inspiration for a <em>Sonic </em>game. As a result, it looks similar to the original sidescrollers and features several returning characters, but you’ll also notice smoother animations and more vibrant scenery. See it for yourself in the trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic Galactic </em>includes five playable characters, including the main trio of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.

                <p>Amazon has started canceling preorders for the Nintendo 3DS version of Mighty No. 9, a game that was released almost 10 years ago. Developed by Comcept and former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mighty No. 9 was billed as a spiritual successor to Mega Man.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qsxliyc2vtv2ljcp33e4ta3y?ref_src=embed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky user</a>, Amazon UK sent a notification to them saying that their preorder for Mighty No. 9 on Nintendo 3DS was canceled due to the lack of availability. Surprisingly, this user placed the order in 2022, indicating that people were still able to preorder this version of Mighty No. 9 years after it came out on other platforms.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was funded via Kickstarter and became one of the most infamous funding campaigns in video game history. The 3DS and PS Vita versions were added as stretch goals for the campaign if it hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/27/4777614/mighty-no-9-stretch-goal-ps-vita-3ds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$3.5 million, which it ended up reaching</a>.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was released in <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mighty-no-9/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 for PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One</a>. However, it looks like the 3DS and Vita versions will never come to fruition. Inafune has since moved on to other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-times-new-trailer-shows-off-new-jobs-and-island-customization/1100-6519560/" data-ref-id="1100-6519560">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-no-9-review/1900-6416453/" data-ref-id="1900-6416453">Mighty No. 9 review</a>, we said, "For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds. It may rouse excitement from time to time, but by and large, it lacks a pervading sense of artistry, both in its level design and presentation."</p>
