			<p>Sandfall Interactive has a much bigger success on their hands than they could have predicted with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, so naturally, players who have already gorged themselves on the game since its launch are hoping to hear that there's more to come from the studio.</p>
<p>Which there very well could be, as lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen hints to fans in a conversation on Instagram (spotted by <a href="https://n4g.com/articles/playstation-chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good-says-lead-writer/">N4G</a>) that the chances are "<em>good</em>" that the team at Sandfall will begin working on DLC, or at least "<em>something more</em>" from the world of Clair Obscur.</p>
<p>"<em>Nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!</em>" Svedberg-Yen began when trying to answer the question of whether DLC for Clair Obscur is incoming.</p>
<p>"<em>We've always said if there is strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>It's not by any means a definitive answer, but it does point in the right direction for fans of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And as Svedberg-Yen points out, the team is still just taking everything in at the moment. If there will be DLC incoming, it'll be a while before it's ready to be shown. The new RPG has been a hit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/">surpassing half a million</a> copies sold during its launch day and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">then exceeding the one million mark</a> over its launch weekend.</p>
<p>Which is an even bigger feat when you consider that it entered the market as a brand-new series, just days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was released. Both titles were available on Xbox Game Pass, and still, Clair Obscur reached the one million milestone of copies sold in such a short amount of time, not just <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/">player engagement</a>.</p>

Sure, this could be seen as a shot across the bow of the SteamDeck and similar PC handhelds, but it also demonstrates the confidence the studio feels about the upcoming launch title.</p><p dir="ltr">In a new Creator's Voice video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fex9IhmnQe0">on YouTube</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of technology Charles Tremblay expressed his enthusiasm for Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2--specifically in handheld mode. "Using on the go, we have the new amazing LCD screens with the VRR support [on Switch 2], and I do think it's the best way to experience the game on the go," said Tremblay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fex9IhmnQe0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fex9IhmnQe0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As a fun addition, Tremblay noted that playing the RPG on Switch 2 will also be "the more cyberpunk way to play Cyberpunk [2077]." Another interesting tidbit about the game for Nintendo's upcoming hybrid console is utilizing "one of your Joy-Cons to fight with your katana," according to CD Projekt Red game director Adam Badowski. The developer previously mentioned that touchscreen controls and mouse functionality would be supported when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077 was confirmed as a Switch 2 launch title</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-launch-title-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-features-dlss-support/1100-6530997/">the first Switch 2 game announced to offer DLSS support</a>, with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling being utilized in all four modes for the RPG.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flcl-reanimated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love fan-animated projects. I love it when they do <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-fan-film-legend-goku-vegeta-broly-super-s-1849153117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what-if <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and give Vegeta</a> his due. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ndBoc6R8_A&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emulate Saturday morning cartoons and <em>Dr. Slump</em></a>. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7bsmT-Jn0&amp;pp=ygUhaSBkb24ndCB3YW50IHRvIGJlIGEgbWFnaWNhbCBnaXJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put a spin on magical girl tropes</a>. My favorite kind of animated project is when a group of artists unite to craft something that combines the polished flair of a professional animation studio with the charming, rough edges of fan works. <a href="https://youtu.be/p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FLCL Reanimated</em></a> has been added to my pantheon of favorite anime fan projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A little while ago, I wrote a piece for Gizmodo<em> </em>about the oral history of <a href="http://www.bartkira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bartkira</em></a>, specifically how its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-history-behind-that-viral-bartkira-anime-trailer-2000533127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animated trailer came into being</a>. <em>Bartkira </em>was a collaborative fan project that started on Tumblr in 2013, in which 768 artists each contributed five pages to redraw six volumes of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/animation-cel-auction-akira-batman-bugs-bunny-disney-1851504043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katsuhiro Otomo</a>’s <em>Akira </em>manga in distinctive art styles reminiscent of <em>The Simpsons</em>. It's all trippy to behold, especially with how seamlessly each painstakingly drawn manga panel blends into the next, creating an almost mural that encapsulates how each artist perceives the formative manga series in their unique styles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SWt6OQ4Nl4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The animated trailer</a>, which had 31 animators working on it for nine months, is chef’s kiss. Now, history appears to be repeating itself once more with yet another group of artists who united their forces on the internet to reanimate one of anime’s most outlandish and special series, <em>FLCL</em>, just in time for its 25th anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FLCL Reanimated</em> was first announced back in 2021 when Twitter user Kobe Kendall, aka Sleptboi, sent out a feeler on an <em>FLCL </em>fan account asking if folks thought it’d be cool if <em>FLCL </em>got reanimated. Like <em>Bartkira</em>, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> saw over 300 artists divvy up clips to remake <em>FLCL</em>’s fifth episode, “Brittle Bullet,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/563432/flcl-reanimated-interview-premiere-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. <em>Polygon </em>also notes that they went the extra mile by creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DImNjfCpmyS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover albums</a> and a <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/d659cb0d2a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zine that emulated Newtype magazine</a> filled with behind-the-scenes production materials, which just so happens to be my favorite thing about an animated work. A joke that the creators poked fun at in a promotional video, the work began to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flclreanimated.bsky.social/post/3lnnnvrizhk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a question of whether it would ever come out</a>. And come out, the episode did. Clocking in at just over 28 minutes, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> is sick as hell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FLCL REANIMATED" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p13E4a_Iy9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Admittedly, <em>FLCL </em>is an anime series that, despite watching, I’m still not entirely sure I comprehend on a strictly narrative basis. There’s a space-faring robot; a pink-haired, guitar-wielding, moped-riding lady who is also from space; and a boy with a rather obvious metaphor for puberty—a bulge on his forehead. From this bulge, the robot and various other oddities emerge, brought forth by the coaxing of said pink-haired cosmic lady. That’s all you need to know, plot-wise. All that matters is that the show is a fucking vibe filled with iconic one-liners, sick music, and fluid action choreography that only old school Gainax could’ve gotten away with in the span of six episode– a trick that’s proven to be diminishing returns whenever Adult Swim has attempted to recapture lightning in a bottle, <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-progressives-premiere-is-a-little-tame-1826196547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time and time again</a>, with its <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-fooly-cooly-grunge-adult-swim-premiere-review-1850809316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent sequel series that no one asked for</a>. Fortunately, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> does a superb job of showcasing how bonkers <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki’s directorial debut</a> was when it was first shown in the States on Toonami. Watching the fan-made episode was like gazing through a kaleidoscopic viewfinder, shifting effortlessly between surreal settings. Each flip revealed a new art style that ranged from dogmatically faithful renditions of its manga to quirky, <em>South Park</em>-esque cardboard cutouts, and an eclectic array of vibrant, kinetic visuals that brought a new texture to the already out-there anime series.</p><p>What’s more, like <em>Bartkira</em>, the lower third of the fan project features the social media handles of its artists, allowing viewers to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbk5weEd5Rk5rOEVZaDdRSGlvWTd1ZE1mb2l5Z3xBQ3Jtc0trQkV2dk5NT0FEc0wyMDBZWFNVbkN5SDlGRkRKUHk3dHR1UjlrVUxwNWV5VFNpTWh2b2NvVmRWdnNSQVNrRndLSGV0NE0xWWdfZURac2M0cUxROTV5QklQWmV4bVdFYnQzbktmMWsxVEZwM1NBSE9Maw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1f5EUWcc-zvLzgrIhc0xOZvTGAICyyfBuNg3ejwAM9vs%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;v=p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore more of their work</a>. The damn thing even has eyecatches that give off that kind of modern day Adult Swim Toonami commercial break vibe (and spoof commercials to boot). It’s a slight, old-hat anime touch that does wonders for making a series feel just that extra bit special. I’m particularly fond of the D.A.R.E. ad with Mamimi Samejima smoking a bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> absolutely delivered, reigniting the magic that makes <em>FLCL</em> a one-of-a-kind visual masterpiece. It showcased a stunning tapestry of creativity, proving fan artists can transcend the label of "fan art" to craft something extraordinary. Here's hoping it sparks a fresh wave of fan-animated projects.</p><p><em><strong>Correction 4/29/25, 12:28pm</strong>--An earlier version of this article misstated the number of artists involved in the project.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners"><h3>Grace Did Nothing Wrong</h3></a><p>Some Sinners fans need to ease up on homegirl

		<p>Netmarble has announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be released on May 21st for PC and mobile devices. This Game of Thrones title puts you in the boots of the heir to House Tyre, a small noble House from the North. You are instructed by Jon Snow to travel around Westeros to rally the Great Houses and the lords of the realm to fight against the White Walkers.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Launch Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpdoaR8N_a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There will be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin, with a a focus on player vs player combat as well as combat against threats that stalk the wilds of Westeros. Players will have the chance to roam freely through familiar settings including Castle Black, King’s Landing, and High Garden.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-shows-just-how-far-mobile-gaming-has-come/">Game of Thrones Kingsroad shows just how far mobile gaming has come</a></h2>
<p>Dom spent some time earlier this year playing Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and in his preview he said, <em>“The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos. Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes.”</em></p>

<p>As mentioned in Dom’s preview, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be a free to play title, though people can buy founder’s packs to play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/"> the early access version of the game</a> on PC via Steam. If you are a mobile player, you can pre-register your interest by following the links; <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on the App&nbsp;Store</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got&amp;pli=1">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad – Apps on Google Play</a>.</p>

If a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell</a> remake fell in the woods, would over the top industry secrecy and NDAs even allow us to hear it? That's the million dollar question literally no one is asking, because who phrases things that way, but enough about that game that may or may not exist at this point in time, we've got a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> to talk about: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-blacklist">Blacklist</a>. Yes, the, technically speaking, most recent entry in the series just received a little update on Steam yesterday which… <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/235600/view/519711795144819220">adds achievements into the game</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As a reminder, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 12 year old game that did in fact release on other platforms, where it also had achievements, so why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have decided to add them in now all this time later is anyone's guess. Seriously, I'm sure this is something that at least one person wants, it's just such an odd thing to do.
</p>
<p>
There is a slight caveat to the announcement that mostly depends on how much you like achievement hunting. Ubisoft explains that "achievements will be retroactively earned for the accomplishments already completed in your game." That means if you've already played the game on PC you'll have up to 28 achievements already achieved, for lack of a better word. Oh, and don't worry, all 19 online achievements that you needed online services for haven't been added in, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-give-online-services-for-older-games-a-stay-of-execution">those services aren't actually offered any more</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do appreciate that a game this old has received a little update like this, but you can't help but wonder what's going on with that remake. The last real update for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">back in 2022</a>, where some concept art was shown off. Since then… not much else has materialised. It's no secret that Ubisoft have been struggling for a while, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Tencent having to give them a whole lot of money recently</a> to keep things running. Maybe with some cash coming in, the time for the remake is almost upon us.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">These days Call of Duty is filled with outlandish shop bundles, including animal-themed operators, neon-colorful outfits, and characters like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. However, a wacky new operator bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is causing controversy, as some players are calling the bundle's emote a sneaky pay-to-win tactic.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the latest shop items in Call of Duty is the Cardboard Commando bundle. This includes an operator constructed out of cardboard boxes, and everything in the bundle is themed around cardboard, too. The controversy comes from the bundle's "Surprise Gift" emote, which allows you to turn into a cardboard box mid-game.</p><p dir="ltr">The emote can be seen in the clip above, as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1916567772387070072" rel="nofollow ">ModernWarzone</a>, and several comments on the video are already calling the emote a pay-to-win feature.</p><p dir="ltr">Being able to quickly conceal yourself in Call of Duty can be quite the advantage, especially in more competitive modes like Search and Destroy or Warzone's battle royale. This cardboard box is fairly large and should look out of place in most settings. The emote also only temporarily lets you disguise yourself as a box. So, while this paid emote could potentially give you a competitive edge over your opponents, it's unlikely to fool anyone who isn't a new player. Still, this is a 2,400 CoD Points ($20) bundle that probably shouldn't let you hide.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty recently had another pay-to-win bundle controversy with the game's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-include-nerf-for-terminator-skin/1100-6530740/">Terminator skin has been adjusted</a> to include better visibility, but it was a very minor visual change.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-never-guess-who-the-next-cod-operator-might-be/1100-6531191/" data-ref-id="1100-6531191">Seth Rogen may become a future Call of Duty operator</a> as part of the stoner-themed content arriving with the Season 3 Reloaded update. Here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/">major announcements for Season 3 Reloaded</a>, including a new weapon, Ranked Play for Warzone, and more multiplayer maps.</p>

We know that it will continue the story of the previous games, albeit with Ciri now serving as the series' protagonist, and that former hero Geralt (and his long-time voice actor, Doug Cockle) will still be around in some capacity. However, the voice artist behind The Witcher 3's Yennefer of Vengerberg has said she doesn't know yet if her character will return for the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Denise Gough, who now stars in the Star Wars series Andor as Imperial Officer Dedra Meero, wasn't sure if Yennefer would return, much less the level of progress of the game.</p><p>"I don't know any of this," Gough told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yennefer-voice-artist-doesnt-yet-know-if-shes-back-for-the-witcher-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. She also looked back at her initial signing on for the role and was confused by the process.</p><p>"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"</p><p>The sorceress Yennefer is part of The Witcher's main character trinity, along with Ciri and Geralt. Her 'complex' relationship with Geralt, is featured in numerous Witcher stories as well as a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV adaptation. In the series, she is played by actress Anya Chalotra.</p><p>Fans got their first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">in May last year</a>. The Witcher Season 4 production started a year ago, with Netflix announcing that the series will end with Season 5. The final two seasons will adapt the events from The Witcher books, Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake.</p>

		<p>Gearbox and Sony have announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> gameplay deep dive State of Play will stream tomorrow, 30th April, through the official PlayStation Twitch and YouTube channels.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to tune in from 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST to see over 20 minutes of developer-led gameplay to show what’s new, old and a bit different about this latest game in the hit looter shooter series.</p>


<p>In a further surprise, Borderlands 4’s release date is now set for 12th September across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC – this is actually earlier than was announced in February’s State of Play by two weeks. Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Gearbox is now owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>, and Take-Two’s constantly said that GTA 6 will launch in late 2025, perhaps there’s a bit of insider knowledge as the company looks to make as much money as possible?</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s showcase will be hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson. This will see the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos and take down the Timekeeper, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evil-dead-game-delisted-playstation-epic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eagle-eyed fans have noticed that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>appears to have been delisted from two major storefronts, prompting worries that the game may be about to be shut down.</p>

<p>Over on the game's official subreddit, user ThePatMan117 (who has quite the flair, by the way) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilDeadTheGame/comments/1ka4d44/update_evil_dead_the_games_epic_games_store/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spotted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>has disappeared from both the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/evil-dead-the-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/evil-dead-the-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>. The listing for the game is now a dead link in both cases.</p>

<p>Strangely enough,&nbsp;the game is still available on both the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/evil-dead-the-game/9pd4jfnzcz90/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493750/Evil_Dead_The_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, so it is, of course, entirely possible that the PlayStation and Epic delistings are just a mistake and that normal service will resume soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-delisting-car.jpg?itok=tm5fM0hA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-delisting-car.jpg?itok=WLGl3Jj1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>could be on the way out.</figcaption></figure><p>I fired up my PS5 to check whether the game is still available via the console's storefront and I didn't see it while searching, so it looks like you can't buy it via either the web interface or the PS5's store.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there's been no official word from developer Saber Interactive, and the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>X account hasn't posted anything for a number of months. We've reached out to Saber to ask whether the game's delisting is a mistake or intentional.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>, it's an <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-dead-game" rel="nofollow">asymmetrical multiplayer horror game</a> along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-by-daylight" rel="nofollow">Dead by Daylight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th</em><em>: The Game</em>, although as the name suggests, it's based around the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>You can choose to play either as the forces of good, led by Ash Williams, or the Kandarian Demon and its Deadite followers, and as you'd expect, the action can get pretty gory and violent at its most outre.</p>




<p>A quick glance at&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1493750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam numbers</a> might suggest a reason for its potential delisting; the game currently has just 31 players online, with a 39-player peak over the last 24 hours. Of course, it's available on consoles and other storefronts too, but that's not an encouraging figure.</p>

<p>It does, however, prove that servers for&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>haven't been shut down yet, although that may change in the near future. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

We have all ridden the emotional rollercoaster of thinking that we're smart and patient enough to play a dedicated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game, then realising that we're inept and bored and just want to bonk things with a big axe. Still, I'm moderately enthused by this here release date trailer for The Siege And The Sandfox, a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> in which you clamber steadily out of a huge, opulent dungeon.</p>
<p>It launches on 20th May, and puts me in mind of Prince Of Persia, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, Vagante and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>.

You are the Sandfox, obviously - a "notorious assassin" and royal protector - and that's your own desert city that's under Siege. As the game begins, the Sandfox catches the city's Queen murdering the King. She promptly throws him into a big hole. Left for dead, you must journey upward through a realm of caves, mausoleums and decrepit yet majestic architecture, making a few friends and avoiding quite a lot of guards and area-specific ne'er-do-wells with distinct capabilities. The aesthetic isn't startling but it is enveloping: a generous, greasy cut of 16-bit orientalism, with lots of baroque backdrops and light seeping through the pixels.
</p>
<p>
You will make use of parkour techniques such as pole-swinging, together with devious, underhand gambits such as politely closing doors behind you. Along the way you will encounter an ancient evil. Something tells me that the ancient evil will ultimately prove more important than getting vengeance on the Queen. Wouldn't be surprised if the Queen was the goodie, actually. Wouldn't be surprised if she butchered the King to keep said ancient evil in check somehow. But enough of my soothsaying.

Developers <a href="https://cardboardsword.co.uk/">Cardboard Sword</a> are "an AAA-experienced multi-talented team with over 160 years of combined experience". I hate self-promotion that weirdly slops together the lifeforce of team members. I'm spitefully picturing one stooped and spindly programmer with a long white beard, surrounded by a crowd of shrieking eight-year-old designers and artists. Their other games include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/509950/Transmission/">Transmission</a>, which is "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a> on a rainy summer night in 1986".

Now <strong>you can change your character’s gender, identity, and voice, as well as equip them with any of the clothing items or full outfits you’ve unlocked</strong>. Some cosmetics are locked behind progression or wheel spins, while others can be purchased using credits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-the-most-its-fine-game-weve-played-in-a-while<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders is blisteringly, aggressively archetypical, the extraction-est extraction shooter that ever extracted. It’s one of the least surprising games I’ve ever played, holding so much in common with its inspirations that they’re almost comically indistinguishable. For preview purposes, this is a very good thing:  If you enjoy other games about scavenging goods while avoiding PvE foes and robbing PvP humans, you’re probably going to like ARC Raiders. If you don’t, then there’s likely nothing new here to tempt you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a game so unabashedly tied to its progenitors that the hero’s default melee weapon is a pickaxe, the same weapon Fortnite metaverse heroes dropping off the Battle Bus lug into combat. That’s a cute enough homage, but it's only the tip of the iceberg for the ways ARC Raiders will be instantly comprehensible to those who play Battle Royale, tree-punching survival games, or extraction. There’s very little that feels truly original, but the components bolted together from other successful live service games click together predictably and produce a satisfying result. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">ARC Raiders - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal each round is simple: go to the surface and then get back underground alive with better loot than you started with. Two forces stand in the way of that goal. The first are the ARC, AI-controlled battle robots that wander the map searching for any sign of organic life. The ARC are no trifling threat. Even the smallest bots can prove surprisingly dangerous, especially in groups. The little spider-like scurriers are downright upsetting for an arachnophobe like me, and the large crawlers do not mess around. ARC wander the map listening for the sounds of search or battle and swarm any humans they find. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ARC are especially dangerous in numbers, and there are plenty of subtle little traps set where clusters of different ARC with complementary abilities are placed near one another, sometimes hidden in indoor areas where one can literally trip into them. I met my fate more than once when I got overconfident around ARC. One crawling monstrosity literally spun into the air with its legs like some cyclops spider helicopter. Take down an ARC, though, and the rewards can be worth your trouble. They generally contain ammo and weapon components. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Screenshots and GIFs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second and more deadly threat are your fellow raiders. If you choose to play ARC Raiders, you’d best enjoy watching your back, because to quote Casablanca, “this place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere.” It’s often more efficient to fall upon a fully-loaded player who isn’t paying attention than to risk a half hour of bracing open doors in a nearby warehouse, or to lurk near an extraction point and cut down somebody when they’re about to escape. Of course, every other raider is likely looking to do the same to you. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you choose to play ARC Raiders, you’d best enjoy watching your back, because to quote Casablanca, “this place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is competent enough to be satisfying. Your third-person avatar moves and controls like most other third-person avatars in modern shooters, with no real irregularities or surprises in the controls. Bullets mostly go where you want them to, depending on the capabilities of your chosen weapon, and melee attack power is substantial. Firearms feel right: SMGs are springy and difficult to control, assault rifles steady and heavy, sniper rifles punch like artillery. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing in teams of three adds a bit of depth to the battle, as you and your companions can search and cover for each other much more systematically than is possible with a single raider. Firefights between teams develop a sense of strategy, as coordinating squads deploy flanking tactics and ambushes against groups of foes. Whether calling out directions, overhearing sounds, covering all windows in a room, your three-person squad will find plenty of tension waiting in most buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleverly-designed maps draw the characters in. The most lucrative resource hubs are clearly marked, and players flock to the richest areas looking for loot, or hover between the treasures and the extraction areas, waiting to dispossess the luckiest foragers of their well-won gains. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The environments are passable, with the usual collection of rusty warehouses, abandoned apartment buildings, and overgrown vacant lots you’ll find in a lot of post-apocalyptic shooters. Everything is serviceable, but it all kinda feels like they gave Fortnite a coat of Day Z grime and moved on. It’s a boring enough world that it certainly took me out of any chance of getting into the lore. But I don’t really think lore is the big draw here anyway. ARC Raiders is meat loaf without much plate presentation, but the meat loaf is tasty if a little cold. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>ARC Raiders is meat loaf without much plate presentation, but the meat loaf is tasty if a little cold. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every drawer and cabinet is a potential source of wealth: crafting components, ammunition, shields, healing items, and weapons. Ammunition is properly segmented enough to keep you hungry as you scavenge and construct guns. Light, medium, heavy, and shotgun ammo variants are available early on to locate in the overworld, craft in your lair, or purchase underground. Materials have the usual, predictable levels of rarity corresponding to color, with certain colors granting the ability to develop more useful or rare items. A single special pocket in your inventory allows you to keep one special discovered item safe even in the event of your death, so that you can haul your rarest finds home even when you die.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some containers take time to open and generate quite a bit of noise when manipulated, which is a delightful tension-raising mechanic that I really appreciated. Opening one of these was especially harrowing when playing solo... you can really feel the vulnerability with your camera locked forward, not knowing what passing robot or player might discover you as you make an ugly racket jimmying a door. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You spend your time between rounds underground, where you convert your ill-gotten gains into an ever-escalating series of crafting tables allowing for the creation of ever-more-elaborate gear. You can also choose to straight liquidate materials and finds for cash, and purchase fully-created items at in-game stores. There’s also some part of crafting that involves a live rooster. I never figured that out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the world above, you gain experience which opens up access to a series of Skill Trees. Selecting various branches can help you optimize your avatar to your playstyle, increasing combat ability, mobility, or stealth. The different abilities are clearly labeled, and most are useful enough that every step feels like real progress. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character design with default options is pretty rough, but a number of better textures and outfits open up when you apply premium currency. I deliberately made my guy look as bleak and sad as possible using only default options, but my multiplayer partner had this whole ZZ Top Man With No Name vibe going on... I was envious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders previews pretty well, perhaps because its design conservatism makes it so instantly familiar. There’s absolutely nothing here to challenge what came before, but sometimes, that’s okay. Overall, the ARC Raiders loop seems pretty well tuned to satisfy: make it to the surface to loot and kill, bring your goods and experience back underground to improve your abilities, head back up stronger to find stronger gear, and repeat. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-breakout-success-is-kicking-up-tired-arguments-over-turn-based-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the topics in constant rotation in role-playing discussions and forums, few have come up as often as turn-based games. The classic gameplay style of many RPGs has contended with more action-oriented systems for some time, and now Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is restarting discussion over the direction of some genre titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 went live last week and is, by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">both IGN's</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18026/clair-obscur-expedition-33" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many other accounts</a>, an excellent RPG. It is unabashedly clear about its inspirations. There's a turn order, Pictos to equip and master, zoned-out "dungeons" to crawl, and even an overworld map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17041-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-celebrating-turn-based-games-classic-rpg-influences-in-making-something-new" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPGsite</a>, producer Francois Meurisse said Clair Obscur was conceived as a turn-based game from the start, and pointed to Final Fantasy VIII, IX, and X in particular. Of course, there's also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which is where Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's turn-based action takes after both FromSoftware's games and the likes of Mario &amp; Luigi: using quick-time events on attacks, and parrying / dodging on defense.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is a turn-based game that feels like a traditional turn-based game when you're inputting attacks and crafting your strategy each turn, then like a more action-oriented game when you're doing damage or defending against it. It's a fascinating system that has, predictably, stirred up discourse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Namely, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/expedition-33s-sublime-success-sparks-chatter-about-final-fantasys-future" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media users have taken the opportunity</a> to point out Clair Obscur's success as a counter-argument to long-held grudges over positions on turn-based games; namely, from the Final Fantasy series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An easy example: Naoki Yoshida, while on the media tour for Final Fantasy XVI, talked about why Final Fantasy and RPGs have taken on more action-based mechanics over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs," Yoshida told Famitsu (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>). “I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I’ve seen quite a number of opinions saying 'I don’t understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This opinion is only increasing, particularly with younger audiences who do not typically play RPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This thinking is reflected in the series, as Final Fantasy XV, XVI, and the VII remake series have all opted for more action-driven systems. Each has garnered their own share of fans and detractors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And comments about turn-based games, and whether they connect with players, often come up in those moments. It's easy to see how stalwarts might read Yoshida's comments and hold a grudge, and now feel vindicated by Clair Obscur's status as the hottest game on the block. Here is a turn-based RPG, inspired by the greats, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve, and thriving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any truth is, as always, a little more nuanced than just that. It's certainly a little more nuanced than just, "Final Fantasy should do this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, Square Enix might have seen its Final Fantasy series head in a more action-oriented direction, but it certainly hasn't dumped turn-based games wholesale. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-ii">Octopath Traveler 2</a> was, in this writer's opinion, one of the better role-playing games in the last few years, and the publisher has continued to roll out more turn-based RPGs, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond">SaGa Emerald Beyond</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">upcoming Bravely Default remaster</a> for Switch 2. While Final Fantasy may not be as turn-based as its SNES or PlayStation 1 days, it's not like Square has done away with the format.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And if the question is whether Final Fantasy should imitate Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, or whether this is "Final Fantasy if it was good" or not, well, <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/1915893483061055725" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'd have to agree with everyone</a> replying with a resolute "nope." Final Fantasy has its own aesthetic drives and iconography that a simple "replace X with Y" can't really account for. While some comparisons between Clair Obscur and Final Fantasy are obvious, it's also easy to note the differences. Reducing Clair Obscur down to "Final France-tasy" is fun wordplay, but it does a disservice to both what's made Final Fantasy an enduring series, and what Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done to elevate itself above mere imitation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is, funny enough, not the first time we've done this. Those with some tingling soreness in their lower backs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/i2v43i/lost_odyssey_was_the_true_final_fantasy_successor/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might recall discussions about Lost Odyssey</a> and whether it was the "true" successor to Final Fantasy, over the series' direction going into Final Fantasy XIII. Go back even further, and you can probably dig up conversations about whether Final Fantasy VII is truly better than Final Fantasy VI or not. As long as there have been two Final Fantasy fans on the internet, there have been arguments about Final Fantasy on the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is accounting for sales either, which were a driver for Yoshida's aforementioned comments to Famitsu on Final Fantasy XVI's direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As I said, I believe I know the fun of command system RPGs, and I want to continue developing them, but I thought about the expected sales of Final Fantasy XVI and the impact that we have to deliver," said Yoshida. The Final Fantasy XVI producer did not even rule out the possibility that the next Final Fantasy could use a command system; just that, at the time of the studio making it, Final Fantasy XVI was going to be the game it became.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's an interesting point to watch, as time goes on. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has certainly been a breakout success for Sandfall Interactive and Kepler, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">garnering 1 million sales over three days</a>. It's a strong start, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">Square Enix's expectations for Final Fantasy are usually a bit higher</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most tired part, still worth noting, is the idea that turn-based games might struggle to see success. We have seen breakout hits in the space; notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. While it's easy to point at the tip of the iceberg to make a point, it is worth noting that we've seen these RPGs — which each take after classic role-playing elements in their own way — have garnered both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list">acclaim</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-and-its-only-been-out-a-day">financial success</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, ultimately, Clair Obscur's success means a lot for the team behind it. It's an encouraging project that, even as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we get into discussions on its team size</a> compared to what you expect, feels like a return of the scoped, scaled, mid-budget RPG alongside the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ruined-kings-a-league-of-legends-story">Ruined King</a>. Whether its momentum carries it on higher, to the heights of something like a Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium, is yet to be seen, but you can't ask for a better start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether it signals some radical shift is necessary for Final Fantasy, I'm less confident. While Square Enix has said recent entries like Final Fantasy XVI and FF7 Rebirth's profits <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">did not meet expectations</a>, that feels like a struggle shaped as much by broad shifts in the gaming landscape, as the cost of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">making major entries in huge franchises has not been a cheap endeavor</a>. They're taking a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">long time to make</a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, the lesson to take away is to be unapologetically authentic. Projects that imitate can struggle to break out from the shadows. It's why I stressed earlier that for all the ways Clair Obscur wears its inspirations on its sleeve, it's not wholly defined by its predecessors; its clever combat systems, incredible soundtrack, thoughtful world-building and scene direction all come from within, from the studio's drives. To put it better, here's Larian CEO Swen Vincke, recently discussing the "single-player games are dead" discourse that also pops up quite often:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think we've proven with [Baldur's Gate 3] that you can put in a pretty high budget and expect pretty high results," Vincke told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameSpot</a>. As Vincke has stated several times over, you just have to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-single-player-games-arent-dead-they-just-have-to-be-good">make a good game</a>, one that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023">your creative team is excited to make</a>. That seems like a constructive way forward for everyone, and one that doesn't feel like reheating the leftovers of old internet discourse all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/">Valorant</a> is set to celebrate its five-year anniversary on June 2, 2025, which is why a key focus to Act III will be celebrating the game's biggest moments in the last five years.</p>
<p>Act III and the new battle pass will be live tomorrow, April 30, 2025, featuring a special series of anniversary cards that are meant to highlight Valorant's history, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Duelists Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Cypher's Revenge Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Can't Slow Me Down Card</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Riot's lead for Valorant, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Anna Donlon</a>, spoke about the changes the game has gone through in the last five years and the state of the world when Riot first started to launch Valorant and get players into the game.</p>
<p>She also talked about how the Valorant team at Riot is working to fix some of the longstanding issues the game has faced in the last five years, and that more information regarding those fixes will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if those fixes result in any major changes for the game. Some live service games, like Apex Legends, have been through tumultuous changes in recent years as Respawn has tried to satisfy a player base that was growing increasingly unsatisfied with the state of the game. Those same big swings might not happen here, but the potential is there, as Donlon specifically calls out balancing abilities, which could have a huge impact for a hero shooter.</p>

<p>As far as what players can expect to see in the game tomorrow with the new battle pass, the free track will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killbanner Flex</li>
<li>Solarex Sheriff</li>

This is according to a video posted by Randy Pitchford, CEO of<em> Borderlands</em> developer Gearbox Interactive, that was ironically deleted and reposted because it went up too early.</p><p>“I wanted to be the one to tell you the launch date is changing,” Pitchford said in the video. He reassured players that development was going well, in fact, so well that it was determined the game should be released earlier. But when the news was announced (officially at 11AM) gamers and press immediately started speculating that the bumped up release date has nothing to do with how well development is going. Instead, Gearbox may be simply trying to get <em>Borderlands 4 </em>in as many hands as it can before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games"><em>GTA VI</em> </a>tears a big ole’ hole in the video game market.</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, and we’ve only been given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">the nebulous timing of Fall 2025</a>. Well, September is technically fall in the US, and big AAA games like<em> Borderlands </em>don’t move up their release dates on a whim. Given that<em> GTA VI </em>and <em>Borderlands 4</em> share a publisher in Take-Two Interactive, it seems even more likely that the new release date is merely getting out of the way of a late September launch window for<em> GTA VI.</em> </p><p>However, if what you want is more info on <em>Borderlands 4</em>, Pitchford closed his video by sharing that Sony will present <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/"> a 20-minute State of Play presentation</a> on April 30th at 2PM PT/ 5PM ET.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the quieter, more recent trends I've been enjoying is goofy extraction games. Whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is directly responsible for that trend, or everyone that spent countless hours playing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> as teenagers just kind of all ended up taking similar interpretations, I couldn't tell you. But I'm quite fond of games like it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a>, and obviously even more recently there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">Repo</a> added to the list, horrendous key art notwithstanding. Now, as revealed in a new trailer, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mycopunk">Mycopunk</a>, another one of those kinds of games where you're a robot nobody wanted.

As a rejected robot, you are hired by a corporation to head down onto a planet full of fungus that very much wants to kill you. This fungus has taken over the planet, which could be a natural disaster if you believe said corporation, or there could be something else going on (I'm betting on the latter). Throughout all of this, you have to collect up resources to bring back with you, survive against hordes of fungi, and update and improve your robot to be better equipped for future missions.

I think those of you that enjoy a few chaotic rounds of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a> should get a kick out of this one, as the devs have cited the roguelike as a source of inspiration (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/and-just-like-that-this-fungal-friend-group-fps-channeling-deep-rock-and-helldivers-is-at-the-top-of-my-2025-wishlist/">PCGamer</a>).

There's even a space motel you can hang out in between missions, complete with alien cockroach person Roachard Cox, who talks exactly like a commentator at a horse race in the American south. This hangoutability is what really sells me on this almost micro-genre of games, and as dirty and grimey as Mycopunk looks, I'm into the vibes it's putting out.

Mycopunk doesn't have a release date just yet, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> does actually have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/">demo you can check out on Steam right now</a>.
