<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There is currently no app for you to download the official game.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arknights-endfield">Arknights: Enfield</a>. It is One Of Those Games, to which there are two versions of. Arknights: Enfield is One Of Those Games, as in an anime gacha game filled with anthro-adjacent women for you to roll for and fight with in flashy, lackluster-in-feeling combat. Arknights: Enfield is also One Of Those Games, a factory sim where you build complex systems to produce, uh, something. This is a combination I cannot fathom, but registration for its next beta test is open, so perhaps I can figure it out.
</p>
<p>
Signing up to the test is pretty simple, you just need to head to the <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us/news/3859">official website</a>, fill out a little survey, and at some point you might be told you're in. No guarantees there, but if you're curious about playing it, there's no real risk involved. This is actually the second beta test for the game, and according to the press release, it'll be a bit different from the first one.
</p>

<p>
For starters, the story has apparently received a complete rework, from new cutscenes and dialogue, to choices that you can make that "lead to unique outcomes." There's a new region called Wuling to explore too, a "region that blends Eastern aesthetics with futuristic elements, combining traditional with contemporary."
</p><p>
The test includes nine new operators to try out, and combat has had a bit of a refresh too, with some new skills, tweaked abilities, and updated bosses. There is, of course, that whole factory system to try out too, and controls and visuals across the whole game have apparently been "enhanced."
</p>
<p>
Again, it feels slightly odd for it Arknights: Endfield to essentially be two games in one. I understand the original has some strategy roots, so it feels like a factory sim feels like it might be appealing to a similar kind of crowd, there's just an awkwardness to it. I wonder how the game will reckon with its sense of self because of those stark differences. There's no release date for the game just yet, so we'll have to wait to find out I suppose.

I know that with winter on the way, you might be wanting to play some summery games to remind you of what life was like before Jack Frost started nipping at your chestnuts. Put that to the side, perhaps, just for a while, as developer 11 bit studios have revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2's</a> first bit of DLC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2791510/Frostpunk_2_Fractured_Utopias/">Fractured Utopias</a>.
</p>
<p>
Said release date is, quite appropriate for the season, December 8th, so a little over a month away. If you already own Frostpunk 2 and fancy giving it a go before it launches, you can actually sign up to try it out right <a href="https://frostpunk2.firstlook.gg/">here</a>. The beta test for it kicked off yesterday, and is only meant to last a few days, so there's a chance you're too late, but there's never any harm in putting your name down on a waitlist. Fact!

<p>
Anyway, how about some Fractured Utopias details. According to the game's Steam page, it's all about embracing the "core concept of Utopia Builder mode." How that manifests is apparently by giving it more structure, as well as giving the choices you make a greater sense of weight.
</p><p>
Every faction in the game will be able to build towards its own idea of what a utopia is, complete with new systems, tools, and even a new endgame. There'll be 12 unique unlocks like laws, HUBs, and abilities per faction, and eight new faction hubs in total. On top of that, there's eight new faction-specific variants of the housing district, over 100 new narrative events, a couple premium tales, and to top it all off, a new map.
</p>
<p>
Is any of that worth paying for? Maybe! The base game's been a bit iffy so far judging by the word on the street, and this DLC does sound a bit bare-bones. Guess we'll find out in December! At least the base game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/">40% off on Steam</a>, if you fancy giving it a pop anyway.

            <p>Arc Raiders will return items to your inventory if you lose them to cheaters, saying it is "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA DICE has added a new ‘Casual Breakthrough’ mode to Battlefield 6 with a new update, accessible via the core multiplayer menu. This new mode is designed to be a more comfortable entry point for new players, allowing them to rank up while fighting mostly <strong>bot </strong>enemies.</p>



<p>It was stated by EA that teams will consist of eight real players apiece and 16 bot characters per team.</p>



<h2 id="h-bots-are-making-life-easier">Bots Are Making Life Easier</h2>



<p>Die-hard Battlefield fans have argued that this kind of mode shouldn’t exist outside of Portal, but here it is. Electronic Arts has added Casual Breakthrough to Battlefield 6, introducing a bot-filled mode that allows users to earn career, weapon, and battle pass XP, all while completing challenges and grinding unlocks.</p>



<p>The key thing to note is that any actions against <strong>bot characters </strong>will reward reduced XP, while taking on human enemies yields the full rewards.</p>



<p>Initially, only Siege of Cairo and Empire State have been added to the map rotation, but it was stressed that EA DICE will be monitoring feedback to ‘determine if further adjustments are needed in the future.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing: Casual Breakthrough</p><p>We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The only things that don’t align with the core multiplayer experience are career stat updates, dogtag grabs, and accolades.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to share mixed feedback in the comments section under the post, with many defending the addition. The vibe is, ‘if you don’t like it, don’t play it,’ which makes sense.</p>



<p>One concern is that some players will find an inevitable way to turn Casual Breakthrough into an XP farm mode, but let’s hope that Electronic Arts has its eyes fixed firmly on the data to avoid that happening.</p>



<p>Will you give Casual Breakthrough a try, or are you comfortable enough with the standard mode? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, Microsoft raised the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by a whopping 50% and overhauled the face of the subscription service. It was a drastic event that led to rampant backlash hitting social media platforms worldwide, with many subscribers downgrading their tier or cancelling their subscription altogether.</p>



<p>In a new post, it has been claimed that some, such as Call of Duty’s developers, see the price hike as a positive for the studios making the games that are added to the Game Pass service when they launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-short-term-loss-long-term-gain">Short-Term Loss, Long-Term Gain</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, GhostofHope, a Call of Duty leaker, revealed that they’d spoken to a string of Call of Duty developers who had nice things to say about the Game Pass Ultimate price boost.</p>



<p>Last month, the price of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/">Game Pass Ultimate swelled</a> from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month.</p>

<p>I spoke to several Call of Duty developers who say that the recent price increase for Game Pass from $19.99 to $29.99 is a positive for the Call of Duty studios. </p>



<p>Financially, this will be a win for them as individuals because it will lead to more revenue which means they are more in control of their future and what they can achieve. </p>



<p>There is also a lot more financial upside with bonuses and such if they are successful now. The news of a price increase also means they need to rely on making games that sell more units to achieve these bonuses. </p>



<p>The vibe in Activision with regards to Black Ops 7 is pretty positive at the moment. A few months ago, the executive team was not happy and now they are feeling better.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, the founder of Arkane Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arkane-studios-founder-game-pass-unsustainable/">went on the record</a>, labelling Game Pass ‘unsustainable and damaging’ and stressing that it doesn’t co-exist with other models.</p>



<p>It was also revealed in recent Xbox news that Microsoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-revenue-q1-2026-drop-113m-year-over-year/">console hardware sales</a> dropped by 29% in Q1 FY26, putting further stock in the company diving deeper into publishing, the cloud, and the flagship subscription service.</p>



<p>Do you think the price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was a good thing, or have you canceled your subscription? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>
How do you follow on from making a game that essentially popularised a whole new genre? I can only imagine that question is one Brendan Greene, aka Player Unknown, i.e. the creator of PUBG, has asked himself a few times. The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, a game that has been in the works for a little while now, and at long last has an early access release date.
</p>
<p>
That date isn't too far off either: it's November 20th! And with that release date came a new trailer showing off some new features you can expect in the early access release. While the main mode of the game sees you travelling across a randomly generated wilderness towards a weather tower, there will be an option for a Free Roam mode which lets you walk about the place at a much more leisurely pace. In this mode, the only thing that can kill you is fall damage, so as long as you mind your feet you'll be all good.
</p>

<p>
The early access release will come with a bunch of customisation features too. These can get really minute too, like the amount of cabins that are spawned, how strong the airflow is, that sort of thing. You can also control the weather, allowing for blizzards, acid rain, thunderstorms, and you can control whether it's always daytime or nighttime if you like.
</p><p>
Those of you that like to get creative might be interested in the game's map editor. This one doesn't look massively involved from the trailer, but there might be more going on behind the scenes. Or, if you like playing the maps the game itself generates, you can also share the seeds of those maps with others so they can give them a go.
</p>
<p>
If you're curious about what the game is like in action, Edwin went <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-is-an-enchanting-exploration-sim-tossed-on-a-sea-of-metaverse-imagineering">hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, and even spoke to Greene about it.

			<p>The Fortnite X The Simpsons crossover is now live, bringing the game to Chapter 6, Season 5. Battle Royale players will find themselves dropping into Springfield Island, which according to the developers will provide a fast-paced experience that returns the game to basics. As usual with a new season, each week will introduce new Simpsons-themed gameplay additions and, of course, cosmetics to purchase in the shop. </p>



<p>Each week, the map updates will be previewed through original animated shorts The Simpsons shorts, which have been co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games. The first one is already live; you can find it inside Fortnite (go to the Quests tab and then Animated Shorts), via the game's social channels, and on Disney+. Here's the full schedule of The Simpsons shorts:</p>



<p>● November 1 - “Apocalypse D’Oh"<br>● November 10 - “Sugar High”<br>● November 17 - “Multiplidiocy”<br>● November 24 - “The Incredible Bulk”</p>



<p>The Springfield Battle Pass includes Outfits as premium rewards, including Homer, Marge, Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and a Springfielder Peely. Since it's the weekend, you can also check out the Delulu mode, where new Simpsons-themed weapons can be found. Just be prepared for potential betrayals.</p>



<p>In Fortnite Battle Royale, prepare for a host of tournaments in Springfield, including the Victory Cups, where you earn cash for each Victory Royale you achieve once you reach Round 2.</p>



<p>The new season also sees the debut of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-sidekicks-cute-pets-follow-around-can-only-be-customized-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, with Peels available for purchase in the shop. More Sidekicks will be added starting on Friday, November 7.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>By the way, The Simpsons have also invaded Rocket League, Epic's other big online game. From today through November 17, Rocket League players can complete challenges to unlock in-game rewards straight from Springfield. Keep your eyes on the ball with the Blinky Topper, hide after a loss with the Homer's Hedges Player Banner, get to work with the Waste Wheels, and more. There is also an unlimited challenge that awards 20,000 XP each time.</p>

            <p>
Things aren't sounding so hot over at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developer Rockstar right now. Yesterday, a report came out from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) that a number of employees have been allegedly fired, with the UK's IWGB Game Workers Union claiming it was an act of union busting. Two-Two, Rockstar's parent company, have denied this allegation.
</p>
<p>
According to the report, alongside a post from the IWGB Game Workers Union's Bluesky account, the roles of more than 30 staffers were "terminated" across both UK and Canadian offices Thursday this week. Bloomberg notes that all of the employees were apparently a part of a private Discord group chat revolving around trade unions, with members of this group either a part of the IWGB or were currently attempting to organise at Rockstar.

</span></p><p>
Alex Marshall, president of IWGB, offered this statement: "Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."
</p><p>
Take-Two spokesman Alan Lewis claims the firings were for "gross misconduct," and for no other reason" and that "we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach." It does not appear any specifics over what said gross misconduct might have been shared.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar are no strangers to workplace controversies, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-employees-decry-crunch-controversy">including those involving crunch</a>, though word on that front has been quieter in recent years.
</p>
<p>
As you'll already be aware, the studio is currently working on GTA 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">currently slated for release in 2026</a>.

<p>SpongeBob SquarePants may be heading to Fortnite, if notable leakers’ claims are correct. Furthermore, the collaboration is coming sooner than we’d expect.</p>



<p>If you grew up in the 2000s, you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide-launches-november-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> quite well. The hit Nickelodeon show has been airing for 26 years and still going. Entertaining both kids and adults, the legacy of the animated cartoon is enormous. So, naturally, it’s high time (or tide, in SpongeBob’s case, for the series to come to Fortnite. While a collaboration has happened between the two with UEFN, it seems like it could be much bigger in Season 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-spongebob-squarepants-decals-leaked-for-fortnite-hinting-at-possible-collab">SpongeBob SquarePants Decals Leaked for Fortnite, Hinting at Possible Collab</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor of SpongeBob SquarePants being in Fortnite was first said by <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1984659306851991621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a known leaker in the gaming community. Other insiders like SamLeakss reported the same, stating that the franchise would <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1984669485534466115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">be added with Season 7</a>, launching November 27th, 2025. However, the most concrete evidence comes from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1984658819226476786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984658819226476786%7Ctwgr%5Ef357053515844a5306205f97171b8abb11aeca93%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D155457action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who had an art asset of a smushed Plankton. As some commenters have noticed, it looks like a wheel for the racing game, possibly hinting at what the collab may be for. It also helps that SamLeakss mentions that an SUV would be part of the addition, seemingly confirming it’s part of Rocket Racing.</p>



<p>Just today, The Simpsons were added to Fortnite, transforming the map to Springfield. Seeing how the game has grown into a big commercial success with collabs left and right is crazy. With recent ones being The Black Phone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-10-gorillaz-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gorillaz</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, every series under the sun seemingly wants in with Epic Games’ mulitplayer shooter. Whether SpongeBob appears on the battlefield or as cosmetics is unknown, but fans can expect the porous fellow to appear real soon.</p>



<p>What do you think of the SpongBob x Fortnite collab? What do you hope it looks like? Skins? Cosmetic items? Sidekicks?

            <p>A new rating on the American Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) suggests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is finally on its way to Xbox.</p>
<p>While we knew the horror game had only secured console exclusivity with Sony for a year, there's been no word from Konami on when - or even if - the remake would finally be available on Xbox Series X/S. Until now, that is.</p>

<p>While we still don't have official confirmation by either developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> or publisher Konami, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/">ESRB website</a> clearly states it is coming to Microsoft's platform, making it a matter of when, not if, we'll get a release date.</p>
<p>The ESRB, unsurprisingly, has rated the game M for Mature 17+ due to blood and gore, sexual themes, strong language, and violence.</p>
<p>The summary of the gameplay also includes shockingly huge story spoilers, too, so I'd only suggest visiting the site if you already know some of the game's major twists and revelations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">I had a thrilling time with Silent Hill 2 Remake, awarding it 5/5, writing</a>: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves." It's sold about 2.5 million copies, taking sales for the 20+ year old franchise to 10 million.</p><p>As for the additional DLC chapter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-actor-confirms-weve-not-recorded-anything-for-born-from-a-wish-dlc">Born From a Wish</a>, which was briefly a Xbox-exclusive when it released for the original game? The voice actor behind Remake's Maria recently confirmed she hasn't been contacted by Bloober to record extra content, suggesting there are no plans to release it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that she recorded dialogue or mocap for the additional content while the game was in full production? Sure. Maybe. Could she be bound by an NDA and unable to confirm or deny anything? That's plausible, too. But the expression on her face and the multiple "sorrys" feel more like a gentle letdown than a teasing affirmation.</p>

            <p>
Sure looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is off to an alright start, 'ey? Success doesn't mean there's any rest for the wicked, i.e. a live service game, however. Just yesterday, only a day after launching, developer Embark Studios revealed their Arc Raiders <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025. It's light on details, but does offer a good outline for what you can expect at the very least.
</p>
<p>
In terms of ongoing additions and tweaks, Embark are working on new map conditions, feats, trials, and cosmetics, alongside some general quality of life improvements and mysteriously, "more…" for the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. November, the month we suddenly find ourselves in, looks to be quite packed with additions. There's a whole new map, Stella Montis, which will bring the game to five total. Some "special themed community events" will be held this month (and in December) too.
</p>
<p>
A couple of new Arc machines will be introduced this month, called Matriarch and Shredder respectively. I imagine it's safe to assume that that second one will be looking quite sharp. On top of that, there'll be more quests, weapons, and gadgets to pick up too.
</p>
<p>
Then in December, a snowfall map condition will be added in - no prize for you or me for making an assumption that this one does what it says on the tin. There's also something called the Flickering Flames Event, as well as just a feature titled "Expedition Departure Window." You'll also be able to make your way through a new Raider Deck, and try your hand at even more quests.
</p>
<p>
That's the long and short of it, there is of course a promise for "more" which presumably will come in the new year. You'll need to wait a while longer to find out whatever that might be.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> has been accused of union-busting after terminating the contracts of 30-40 staff, all of whom were purportedly involved in union activities. Rockstar claims they were fired for gross misconduct.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings">Bloomberg</a>, the developers - employed in multiple disciplines and offices across Canada and the UK - had been part of a private union chat group on Discord and were allegedly either already in the union, or planning to organise at the company.</p>
<p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Bloomberg the developers were fired for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason", adding "[Take-Two] fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach".</p>
<p>"Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry," said president of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), Alex Marshall.</p>
<p>"This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."</p>
<p>Rockstar has not commented publicly on the firings or accusations of union busting.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick returned to the subject of AI, this time suggesting the controversial technology could never create anything like GTA 6 because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-couldnt-be-made-by-ai-suggests-take-two-boss-there-is-no-creativity-that-can-exist-by-definition-in-any-ai-model">"no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model."</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Even more psychological manipulation awaits in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5. If you’re eager to be reunited with Huggy Wuggy, we’ve got the latest release date details and when it could be expected.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 apparently wasn’t enough for Poppy Playtime fans, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-teaser-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5</a> is on the way. The lovingly-named Huggy Wuggy and his minions are waiting to massacre you once again, and no doubt you’re here because you’re excited at the prospect, instead of running away—you have ZERO survival instincts, people!</p>



<p>That said, if you’re eager to enter a new area of the factory, let’s get into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-comes-out">Do We Know When Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Comes Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll happen, so be ready. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mob Entertainment hasn’t revealed Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s full release date yet, but Steam shows that we shouldn’t expect the new DLC until 2026 at the very earliest.</strong></p>



<p>If you head to Steam, you’ll see quite clearly: “<strong>Planned Release Date:&nbsp;2026</strong>,” under the usual launch details section.</p>



<p>A Halloween announcement for Chapter 5 understandably had the Poppy Playtime community excited. Was the new release a shadow drop? Was it an announcement to say that it was coming during Holiday 2025? Unfortunately not.</p>



<p>We’ve done the research, checked the game’s Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 – Teaser Trailer, and searched on the main website to no avail. Interestingly, all the top comments on the Chapter 5 teaser trailer are from fans and creators asking for the developer to <strong>take their time with the game</strong>.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 debuted with some technical issues and bugs at launch, which marred the game for many. If Mob Entertainment does this, we might not see Chapter 5 until well into 2026, maybe even closer to next Halloween.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feature-the-art-i-stole-from-nintendo.1341205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f8697cacf056a"><a title="Karen McKenna SMRPG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8697cacf056a/karen-mckenna-smrpg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Karen McKenna</em></figcaption></figure><p>It began with a Zelda T-shirt.</p>
<p>I was wearing my <em>“It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.”</em> shirt while running a quick errand at the bank. The teller spotted it. He was at least 20 years younger than me, but his “Nice shirt!” comment kicked off a lengthy conversation about our shared Nintendo fandom.</p>
<p>Before long, he pulled out a tablet and showed me <a href="https://grantgm.com/">his digital fan art</a>. It was awesome: detailed, dynamic sketches of Mario, Pokémon, and (my favourite) Metroid characters. His passion was apparent.</p>
<p>I told him I was thrilled by his drawings, because I know how much that work means. You see, years ago, I had a job at Nintendo that involved seeing hundreds of pieces of original Nintendo fan art. And I took some home.</p>
<p>This is the story of that collection, and how a handful of drawings, once marked for the landfill, became some of the most meaningful pieces of my gaming collection.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5c6e10cdfd6c9"><a title="Super Mario Characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c6e10cdfd6c9/super-mario-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://grantgm.com/">Grant GM</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Player’s Pulse and a Pile of Precious Paper</strong></h2>
<p>This will definitely date me, but I interned at Nintendo during the second half of 1996. Before long, I was given complete control of Player’s Pulse, the letters to the editor section. I chose fan letters, wrote responses, and, most importantly, picked the envelope art that was displayed on those pages.</p>
<p>Mind you, this was nearly three decades ago, so the letters and the artwork were on real, physical paper, sent via snail mail. This was before the days of email and file shares.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved sifting through the envelope art because it was pure fandom: earnest, expressive, and often beautiful.</p>
<p>I was shocked to learn that it was Nintendo's practice to destroy all artwork after it had been screened and scanned for the magazine! That meant dozens, maybe hundreds, of amateur art pieces in the trash bin each month.</p>
<p>It felt criminal to toss that effort, so I kept all the artwork that came across my desk during my short internship.</p>
<p>Here are five pieces of art that define the long journey of that collection:</p>
<h2><strong>Naomi Chiba’s Envelopes</strong></h2>
<p>Years after I left Nintendo Power, I read a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-power-helped-a-shy-fan-show-her-art-to-the-wor-1786871046">Kotaku article</a> about <strong>Naomi Chiba</strong>, easily the most prolific Player’s Pulse artist ever. While reading, I remembered that I had three of her original envelopes in my collection!</p>
<figure data-uuid="097d8e4038545"><a title="Two published and one unpublished art piece by Naomi Chiba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/097d8e4038545/two-published-and-one-unpublished-art-piece-by-naomi-chiba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Naomi Chiba</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With help from the author, I connected with Naomi and arranged to return her artwork.</p>
<p>Doing so was surprisingly emotional. I hesitated when it came time to seal the envelope, but then it occurred to me that she might be the first person to ever get back the artwork that they had sent to Nintendo Power.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me: this coloured paper meant something.</p>
<h2><strong>Quid pro Quo with Seth</strong></h2>
<p>The success with Naomi led me to find more artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hatlandous/">Seth Hatland</a> came next. He was so grateful to get his <strong>Mega Man X</strong> and <strong>Mario</strong> drawings back that he insisted on trading them for a brand-new piece of art as a thank you. “I’ve gotten slightly better,” he said.</p>
<p>What an understatement!</p>
<p>He sent me an incredible piece of Link that has hung proudly in my office ever since.</p>

<h2><strong>The Big Trade</strong></h2>
<p>After returning art to several more creators, I was connected with Stephan Reese (aka <a href="https://x.com/ArtofNP">ArtofNP</a>) and his non-profit <a href="https://www.interactiveartcollection.org/">Interactive Art Collection</a>. They specialise in original Nintendo Power artwork, although he hadn’t seen much in the way of envelope art - probably because Nintendo had destroyed it all.</p>
<p>I ultimately agreed to add most of my remaining collection to his museum.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2682f716b2d85"><a title="Envelope art from Nintendo Power" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2682f716b2d85/envelope-art-from-nintendo-power.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In return, Stephan sent me an original, professional piece made for the promotional brochure of the Nintendo Super System arcade, circa 1992. I love it almost as much as the amateur stuff, plus I’m happy to know that the rest of the fan art is in a better place than a binder on my shelf.</p>
<figure data-uuid="00245d417ff8f"><a title="Original art for the Nintendo Super System arcade brochure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00245d417ff8f/original-art-for-the-nintendo-super-system-arcade-brochure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>(I'm the "ex-Nintendo employee" mentioned in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-of-nintendo-power-exhibit-a-guided-tour">Nintendo Life post</a> about Stephan’s exhibit a couple of years ago.)</p>

<h2><strong>The One I Kept</strong></h2>
<p>After all that wheeling and dealing, I was left with one volume's worth of envelopes, which hangs in my game room. Here’s Volume 92 in all its glory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6f322714c9cb"><a title="Framed fan-art from Nintendo Power Volume 92" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6f322714c9cb/framed-fan-art-from-nintendo-power-volume-92.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Family Fan Art</strong></h2>
<p>The most recent additions to my art collection are courtesy of my own kids. Is there anything better than a child’s imagination and fandom put to paper?</p>
<p>My oldest is studying art at Utah State University, but her early work continues to remind me that fan art isn't just a fun hobby; sometimes it’s a training ground.</p>

<hr>
<p>When I look at my art collection, I don’t see discarded mail. I see a bond between the creatives at a massive entertainment company and their fans.</p>
<p>My new bank teller friend, with his portfolio of beautiful, detailed digital sketches, is part of a timeless, vital tradition. He's doing what fans, including my own daughter, have done for decades: translating their hobby into a personal act of creation.</p>
<p>I may have initially 'stolen' art from Nintendo, but in the end, that art taught me a lesson: the true heart of a gaming community isn't some corporate office. It's the enduring, incredible passion of its talented fans.</p>

                <p>The day has finally arrived--after months and months of leaks and rumors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">Fortnite's Simpsons season launches today</a>. Just not quite yet, because Fortnite is offline for maintenance following the "Welcome, Our Alien Overlords" event, during which players were treated to a Simpsons short film that explained how they ended up being a part of the Fortnite omniverse.</p><p>As is standard operating procedure for Epic, Fortnite goes offline when it's time for a major update. While this usually happens during the middle of the night on a weekday, this season launch is a special event, and as such, it'll kick off on a Saturday evening. That's why it's offline for maintenance now--Epic wants the launch of Fortnite x Simpsons to arrive during primetime on a Saturday night.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_GXjh_Xi2I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j_GXjh_Xi2I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>When is Fortnite Simpsons season expected to launch?</h2><p>Epic is planning to bring Fortnite back online for The Simpsons season at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, though that time is an estimate and not set in stone. In reality, Fortnite maintenance rarely ends on schedule, as it's simply done when it's done--which actually often means sooner than expected. Fortnite maintenance usually lasts between four and seven hours, and the planned start time here splits the difference exactly at 5.5 hours of downtime. So don't be surprised if the season starts a little before or a little after that time.</p><p>When the season does start, everything will be different. This Fortnite x Simpsons event is introducing an entirely new cel-shaded map based on Springfield from the series, and it'll have a Simpsons-themed battle pass and revamped loot pool. This may just be Fortnite's most thorough collaboration ever.

<p>Don’t Scream Together brings back the terrifying horror of the original and amplifies the fear by allowing you to have multiple friends join you. We’re seeing if Don’t Scream Together has a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S future.</p>



<p>If you’ve somehow not heard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-scream-is-taking-the-horror-world-by-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Scream</a>, it’s probably better for your sanity. The 2023 indie sensation quickly went viral with its retro-looking graphics, palpable tension, and the game’s simple premise: DON’T SCREAM. 2024 saw the game’s full 1.0 launch, and it’s been such a hit that developer Digital Cybercherries is working on Don’t Scream Together—and it would be better on PS5 and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-ps5-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d run too. Credit to Digital Cybercherries</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It can’t be ruled out for the future, but for now, Don’t Scream Together won’t be launching on PS5 consoles</strong>.</p>



<p>So far, developer Digital Cybercherries has made it quite clear that the new multiplayer version of Don’t Scream is targeting a Steam release, meaning it’s only on PC at launch.</p>



<p>On the game’s official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128949867457302530/1156475689789304842/1431060015195881482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, a community post outlines this quite clearly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re incredibly proud to announce DON’T SCREAM TOGETHER, an improved and expanded version of DON’T SCREAM will be <strong>launching on Steam soon!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no mention of consoles, and it’s not even addressed anywhere in the news or info threads.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>We also have to say that Don’t Scream Together isn’t scheduled for any Xbox consoles right now: The Xbox Series X|S or even the Xbox One, to extend the reach a bit more.</strong></p>



<p>This answer is much the same as our PS5 verdict. It seems like Digital Cybercherries is firmly fixed on getting Don’t Scream Together right on PC before even contemplating a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S console release.</p>



<p>But keep reading, because interested Don’t Scream onlookers might like what we have to say next! </p>



<h2 id="h-is-don-t-scream-coming-to-ps5-or-xbox-consoles">Is Don’t Scream Coming to PS5 or Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>A Don’t Scream developer has hinted that the original single-player experience “may find itself on other platforms in the future.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom then. While we’ll have to wait for Don’t Scream Together on console, a console port for 2024’s full Don’t Scream debut could be on the cards.</p>



<p>When asked about Don’t Scream Together crossplay, developer [DCC] Dec (on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2692990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>) said this:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“Crossplay is not in the works currently for this title. The classic DON’T SCREAM singleplayer experience may find itself on other platforms in the future though.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to you if you take this as a win. If you’re looking for a console port of Don’t Scream, you should at least be getting a taste of the OG game that set the Don’t Scream Together wheels in motion.</p>



<p>We’ll have more on its console port later when the news is announced. Are you picking up Don’t Scream Together at lunch? Or are you hungry for horror on PlayStation and Xbox consoles?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a claim surfaced that Activision’s studios were preparing to announce an earlier release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. That was more or less refuted by Treyarch, the lead development studio piecing the game together, but now a new claim has hit the airwaves.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, famed dataminer ‘PlayStation Game Size’ dug up information about the install sizes, pre-load dates, and <strong>release times </strong>for Black Ops 7 on <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. While a disclaimer highlighted that things can change, the data found suggests that the Black Ops 6 campaign and Zombies platform will go live on November 10, rather than November 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-s-campaign-coming-early">Is Black Ops 7’s Campaign Coming Early?</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Black Ops 7’s campaign (and the Zombies offering) is almost certainly <strong>not </strong>being released earlier than intended. This is something that would have been telegraphed by Treyarch to drive up pre-orders, and that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>In the comments under <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367269372145836">their post</a>, PlayStation Game Size suggested that the ‘current release time’ listed in the files could be a PSN error:</p>

<p>Activision’s studios rarely detach the campaign portion of a new Call of Duty game from the multiplayer platform, but it’s not unheard of. In a way, it’s a good thing, as it allows fans to complete the campaign without worrying about falling behind with everyone else flooding the multiplayer platform.</p>

<p>That’s not the case this year, as Activision hasn’t arranged a way for players to access the campaign early, regardless of what the data seems to suggest.</p>
